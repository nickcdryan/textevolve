# DATASET-SPECIFIC LEARNINGS & EXPERIMENT LOG

This document serves as a continuously updated log of learnings, patterns, effective strategies, failure modes, and experimental findings specific to the multi-hop reasoning task using the provided dataset. The goal is to accumulate deep, task-specific knowledge to guide future research and development efforts.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Multi-hop Reasoning (Crucial):** Questions require synthesizing information from multiple documents. Relationships between entities are often *not* explicitly stated and need to be inferred. "Question" field indicates multi-hop tasks. Supporting documents provided; no external retrieval needed. Example: Identifying a director requires linking a film with an actor and then the film with its director.
*   **Entity-Centric Questions:** Questions revolve around specific entities (people, films, organizations, species), demanding the model identify and link information *about* them. Disambiguation of entities is critical. Questions involve connecting multiple entities (e.g., person, position, political party, location). Brands and companies (e.g., Parker Brothers, Hasbro) are frequent subjects.
*   **Attribute Retrieval:** Questions often ask for specific properties/attributes of entities (e.g., *religion* of a person, *year* a company went bankrupt, *location* of a theme park). Requires precise matching. Extracting dates related to specific events/entities is key. Pinpointing precise dates is crucial (e.g., formation year of a club).
*   **Temporal Reasoning & Ambiguity:** Questions require identifying dates, times, or temporal relationships (before, after, during). Numerical comparisons and date calculations are potential failure points. Example: "Did X and Y occur in the same decade?". Questions often lack explicit temporal context.
*   **Location/Place Reasoning:** Some questions require identifying a location or place. Example: "What was Iqbal F. Qadir on when...". The "Dean Mills Reservoir" example is the system incorrectly answering "Bolton" instead of "Rivington Moor".
*   **Context-Heavy Prompts:** Questions include significant contextual information within the prompt itself.
*   **Short, Factual Answers (Crucial):** Answers are generally short, factual pieces of information—single words, short phrases, or dates—presented in plain text. Success depends on generating concise answers. "Yes/No" questions require precise interpretation and focused extraction.
*   **Document Title Importance:** Document titles often contain valuable clues about the document's content. Prioritize information from documents with titles closely related to the question.
*   **Sentence-Level Relevance:** Focus on the most relevant sentences. Sentence embedding techniques can be used. Prioritize conciseness and directness. Implement techniques like negative prompting or "focus on *only* the essential details".
*   **Contextual Information is Key:** Successfully answering depends on identifying and linking entities across documents. Example: inferring the nationality of a director by linking their films to countries.
*   **Implicit Relationships:** The connection between documents may not be explicitly stated, requiring the system to infer relationships based on shared entities or concepts. Answers are not always explicitly stated but can be derived through reasoning.
*   **Ambiguity and Redirection:** Documents can contain potentially misleading information. The agent must filter out irrelevant details. Questions often contain ambiguous terms that require interpretation.
*   **Indirect Questioning:** Questions are often phrased indirectly, requiring identification of the relevant entity and then finding associated information.
*   **Knowledge Domain Variety:** The dataset covers diverse knowledge domains (music, television, history), requiring the system to have a broad understanding.
*   **Document Relevance Variability (Crucial):** Relevance of supporting documents varies greatly. Some documents contain critical information, while others are tangentially related or irrelevant (distractors). Distractors often contain keywords or entities mentioned in the question, but lack the critical connections for multi-hop reasoning. Inclusion of 10 documents per question introduces noise.
*   **Structured Documents:** Data presented as a question followed by a set of supporting documents with clear delineation: `=== Document X: Title ===\n Content`.
*   **Definition/Category Understanding:** Questions often require understanding of definitions or categories (e.g., "cocktail") rather than just factual recall.
*   **Comparative Questions:** Many questions involve comparisons (e.g., "Which band was formed in a country closer to England, Kodaline or Rivermaya ?"). Requires comparing attributes or characteristics of different entities. Questions often ask for comparisons between two entities (e.g., "Between A and B, which...?"). Example: "Which magazine has been around longer...".
*   **Pools/Groups and Year/Competition Specificity:** Documents contain information from multiple "Pools" or "Groups" across different years/competitions, demanding careful filtering based on the question's context (e.g., year, sport).
*   **Entity Extraction Dependence:** Heavily relies on extracting specific entities (e.g., names, positions, dates) from supporting documents, often requiring precise matching. Weak information extraction is a bottleneck.
*   **Ambiguity/Synonymity:** Some questions hinge on understanding synonyms or different ways of expressing the same concept across different documents.
*   **Implicit Information:** Answers often require making reasonable inferences based on the provided documents, rather than explicitly stated facts.
*   **Entity Relationships:** Questions involve named entities (people, organizations, locations) and their relationships to each other (e.g., "professor at," "located in"). Necessitates understanding relationships and performing inference.
*   **Answer Span in Documents:** Answers are explicitly present within the provided documents. The task relies on retrieval and reasoning, not external knowledge.
*   **Diverse Document Content:** Supporting documents cover a wide range of topics and writing styles.
*   **Focus on Precise Information Extraction:** Emphasizes extracting very specific pieces of information, often hinging on a single, critical detail. Granularity Mismatch: Questions often require a specific, granular piece of information extracted from a broader context provided in the documents.
*   **Architectural Style Questions:** Questions involve architectural styles and their relationships to each other (e.g., "X style is a product of Y style"). Requires understanding hierarchical relationships and historical context.
*   **Ambiguous Entity References:** Questions and documents use different phrasings to refer to the same entity (e.g., "Margian\u1e17 in Greek" vs. "Margiana").
*   **Wikipedia Text & Parenthetical Asides:** Supporting documents include text from Wikipedia, often including parenthetical asides.
*   **Distractor Information:** Documents contain extraneous information unrelated to the core question, requiring the model to filter relevant facts and discard noise.
*   **UHF Channel Identification:** A significant portion of questions involve identifying the UHF channel number associated with a specific television station, often requiring entity recognition (e.g., recognizing Cindy Williams' station).

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Viable *if the retrieval is accurate and the LLM can reason correctly*. Achieves 80% accuracy. RAG is limited by retrieval quality and synthesis.
*   **Iterative Validation Loop:** Refine generated answers with iterative validation. *The validator is not sufficiently prioritizing conciseness and directness in the answer.*
*   **Multi-Stage LLM Approach with Specialized System Instructions (Promising):** Effective for creating agent roles (question analyzer, retrieval prompt designer, answer expert, and answer validator).
*   **Explicitly Eliminating Irrelevant Documents (Helpful):** Comprehensive justification for *why* documents are irrelevant improves performance.
*   **Initial LLM-Driven Approach (Experiment 002):** LLM-driven question analysis, prompt engineering, and answer validation achieved 100% accuracy on a small initial validation set.
*   **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Knowledge graph construction is promising for handling multi-hop reasoning via explicit links.
*   **Decomposition:** Breaking down the problem into question analysis, retrieval prompt design, simulated document retrieval, answer construction, answer validation, and concise answer extraction is effective. Decomposing the problem into smaller steps (knowledge graph construction, query design, graph traversal, answer derivation) is also viable.
*   **Agent-Based Prompting:** Using specific agent roles (e.g., "expert question analyzer," "expert retrieval prompt designer") guides the LLM.
*   **Document Relevance (Crucial):** Improvements in retrieving relevant documents have a cascading effect. Retrieval prompt design should factor in the importance of conciseness in the retrieved documents. Document re-ranking shows promise.
*   **Chain-of-Verification with Self-Critique:** The framework itself (analysis, answer generation, critique, refinement, validation) seems sound but needs better inputs at each stage. Specifically, more accurate initial answer generation is needed for self-critique to be effective.
*   **Hierarchical Reasoning (Promising):** The hierarchical reasoning approach seems promising. Needs refinement to avoid verbosity and handle simple questions well. The system understands the documents being provided and can extract and identify relevant information.
*   **Use of Supporting Documents (Crucial):** The questions are designed to be answered *only* by synthesizing information from the provided documents.
*   **Explicit question analysis and prompt design steps:** Valuable for focusing the retrieval and generation steps.
*   **Iterative refinement with a fact checker:** Can be highly accurate but can lead to verbose answers (Experiment 010). Explicit fact-checking is crucial.
*   **Multi-Agent Chain-of-Thought:** Decomposing the problem into question analysis, candidate answer generation, evidence weighing, and answer validation likely contributes to higher accuracy (Experiment 011).
*   **Gemini LLM Stability:** Using the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini LLM appears to be a stable method. The 3-stage approach (Hypothesis Generation, Hypothesis Evaluation, and Synthesis & Refinement) seems beneficial.
*   **Document Summarization and Focused Extraction:** LLMs are capable of identifying relationships between entities across documents.
*   **Adaptive prompt engineering:** Adaptive prompt engineering can be a useful method for improving answer validation.
*   **Query expansion and document re-ranking:** Decomposing questions into sub-questions, then re-ranking documents based on those sub-questions, improves results.
*   **Knowledge Extraction and Focused Synthesis:** Decomposing the problem into extraction, retrieval, and synthesis steps helps. Verification steps between stages are useful for correcting errors.
*   **Iterative decomposition and focused evidence aggregation:** Shows promise for handling multi-hop reasoning, *when* sub-questions are framed correctly and the synthesis step accurately combines evidence.
*   **Agent roles for question decomposition and answer extraction/synthesis:** May be beneficial, provided that the agents are specifically tailored for these sub-tasks.
*   **Meta-reasoning with chain-of-thought:** Partially effective in guiding the LLM to relevant information.
*   **(Improve Answer Conciseness):** Modify the `verification_prompt` to explicitly instruct the LLM to shorten the answer and remove any information not directly answering the question. Include phrases such as "Provide the shortest possible answer" or "Only state X."
*   **(Improve Format Adherence):** Include examples of the desired answer format in the `verification_prompt` to guide the LLM towards producing outputs that match the golden answers.
*   **(Use Negative Examples):** Add negative examples in the prompt indicating information that should *not* be included in the answer.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Failure to Integrate Information:** The primary failure mode is the system's inability to synthesize information from multiple documents.
*   **Incorrect Entity Linking:** Inaccurately inferring relationships between entities.
*   **Incorrect Relationship Inference:** Incorrectly associating attributes/entities.
*   **Ambiguity in Information Extraction:** Struggles to extract the most precise information from the documents, leading to ambiguous answers.
*   **Insufficient Contextual Understanding:** Fails to understand the relationships between entities and attributes mentioned in different documents, leading to incorrect synthesis.
*   **Lack of Precise Reasoning:** Struggles to produce precise answers when the source documents require filtering and integrating complex information.
*   **Multi-document Synthesis Issues:** Incorrectly combines information from multiple documents, even when those documents refer to distinct entities or situations.
*   **Date Misidentification:** Struggles to differentiate between various dates within the retrieved documents and select the correct one relevant to the question.
*   **Overly Strict Evaluation:** The evaluation metric penalizes correct answers that include additional, semantically related information not present in the "golden answer". This indicates that the evaluation is brittle. *Example:* Answering "Cyrtanthus belongs to the Subfamily Amaryllidoideae, while Aspidistra belongs to the subfamily Nolinoideae" when the answer is simply "Cyrtanthus".
*   **Verbosity & Precision in Answer Matching:** System provides verbose answers including supporting evidence, when the gold answer is often a single word or short phrase. The agent not prioritizing information retrieval in cases when it is appropriate, rather than providing a reasoned response.
*   **Lack of Concise Answer Formulation:** The system struggles to provide short, direct answers, even when it has correctly identified the relevant information.
*   **Inability to Filter Auxiliary Information:** The model includes additional details which, while factually correct, detract from the core answer.
*   **Instruction Following (Conciseness):** The agent struggles to discern when a concise, direct answer is preferred over a detailed, reasoning-driven response, and isn't strictly following instructions on answer length.
*   **Entity Resolution Failure:** ReAct agent fails to distinguish entities with similar attributes.
*   **Entity Confusion:** The model might be confusing similar entities or attributes (e.g., confusing different people with the same position across different states or time periods).
*   **Lack of Inference Confidence:** The system often fails to make reasonable inferences even when the information is strongly implied in the documents.
*   **Superficial Comparison:** When comparing attributes, the system relies on simple counts instead of deeper understanding.
*   **Lack of Specificity:** The response contains a lack of specifying reason or the fact in the response. Example: question "Josey Scott and Ian Watkins were both promising musicians. Which of these talented men was incarcerated, impacting his career with a rock band?".
*   **Over-Reliance on Single Interpretation:** The primary failure mode is prematurely committing to a single, narrow interpretation of ambiguous terms within the question.
*   **Incorrect Inference and Assumptions:** The system makes logical leaps not supported by the provided information.
*   **Semantic Misinterpretation:** The system fails to accurately interpret the semantic relationships within the questions.
*   **Semantic Understanding and Relevance Filtering (General):** The model struggles to determine if information, even if factually correct, is *relevant* to the question's intent within the context of the provided documents.
*   **Difficulty with Implicit Relationships:** The model seems to struggle with identifying implicit relationships.
*   **Information Overload & Distraction:** The sheer volume of text in the supporting documents can be overwhelming, and many documents may contain irrelevant information (noise) that distracts from the answer.
*   **Reliance on Keyword Matching:** Instead of true understanding, the system may be over-reliant on keyword matching.
*   **Complex Relationships:** The relationships between entities and events can be complex and require careful analysis.
*   **Ambiguity:** The language used in the documents may be ambiguous or open to interpretation.
*   **Contradictory Information:** Documents might contain conflicting information.
*   **Implicit Information:** The answer might not be explicitly stated but requires inference.
*   **Synonyms and Coreference Resolution:** Identifying that different words or phrases refer to the same entity.
*   **Missing Information:** The provided documents might not contain enough information to answer the question definitively.
*   **Cultural Context:** Understanding cultural nuances or historical context could be necessary.
*   **Incomplete Answer Extraction:** The system's inability to extract the final, concise answer, even when it correctly identifies and synthesizes the necessary information.
*   **Lack of Comprehensive Verification:** The system fails to consider all extracted information when verifying conclusions.
*   **Lack of Specificity in Query Design:** The LLM seems to struggle with crafting queries that directly target the desired answer.
*   **Answer Validation Challenges:** Validating the derived answer against the initial question and supporting documents seems to be a weak point. The validation step should specifically check the validity of the relationships inferred by the model.
*   **Inability to Filter Extraneous Information:** The system struggles to isolate the *most* relevant pieces of information.
*   **Reliance on Golden Answer (Potentially):** The system might be penalized for generating a valid answer containing *more* information than the single-word "golden answer".
*   **Negation Handling:** Potential failure point if the system does not correctly interpret and process negative constraints (e.g., "X is NOT from Y").
*   **Numerical Reasoning:** Potential failure point if the system does not correctly interpret and process numerical operations and comparisons, and date calculations.
*   **Overly Verbose Answers (Simple Questions):** The system fails when it provides excessively detailed justifications for questions that require simple answers (e.g., "yes/no").
*   **Insufficient Examples for Reasoning Patterns:** The chain-of-thought examples provided for answer validation may not cover the diverse reasoning steps required, especially for comparison-based questions.
*   **Difficulty in Comparison:** The model exhibits difficulties in accurately comparing extracted attributes.
*   **Insufficient Support Weighing:** Even when the system considers multiple potential answers, it fails to adequately weigh the evidence supporting each.
*   **Extraneous details or conversational elements:** The primary failure mode, despite perfect core answer accuracy, is verbosity of the output (Experiment 010).
*   **Incomplete Synthesis:** The system struggles to fully integrate information from multiple relevant documents.
*   **Lack of Logical Deduction:** The system fails to make necessary logical deductions.
*   **Missed Contextual Clues:** The system overlooks subtle contextual cues that are crucial for accurate answer synthesis.
*   **Subtle Inference:** A failure mode will likely emerge when the questions require subtle inference or synthesis of information that is not explicitly stated in the documents.
*   **Distractor Documents:** Success depends on selecting the *correct* supporting documents. Irrelevant or misleading documents can cause failure.
*   **Complex Logical Relationships:** The system may struggle with questions that require understanding complex logical relationships (e.g., cause-and-effect, hierarchical structures).
*   **Retrieval Prompt Limitations:** If questions become more complex, retrieval prompts might not be sophisticated enough.
*   **Lack of Chain-of-Thought Granularity:** The Chain-of-Thought reasoning is at too high a level. The model needs more detailed reasoning steps to ensure that the final answer is exactly what the question asks.
*   **Inability to isolate the specific answer from relevant details:** Model identifies the correct answer within the retrieved context, but includes additional context that leads to it being marked incorrect.
*   **Lack of temporal reasoning:** The model failed to correctly infer which party the governer was a part of from the passage of text provided.
*   **Incorrect Location identification:** The system incorrectly answers "Bolton" instead of "Rivington Moor". The question asks for a precise location (the hill that the Reservoir sits on), however, the script provides an adjacent town.
*   **Insufficient Granularity in Information Extraction:** The system extracts broad concepts rather than pinpointing the exact answer.
*   **Lack of contextual understanding:** The system struggles with understanding the context of the information provided in the documents.
*   **Inability to handle "yes/no" questions:** The LLM struggles to provide definitive "yes" or "no" answers, often providing additional context or misinterpreting the question's intent. For example, in the "Hungry Hungry Hippos and Parcheesi" question, instead of saying "no," the system confirmed that Parker Brothers published both games (Hungry Hippos *originally*).
*   **Over-inclusive answers:** The model sometimes includes irrelevant information in its final answer, obscuring the core "yes" or "no" determination.
*   **Sensitivity to quality of sub-questions and precision of synthesis:** Question decomposition and evidence aggregation are highly sensitive to the quality of sub-questions and the precision of the synthesis stage.
*    **Over-informativeness:** The system provides overly detailed answers, including extraneous information not present in the gold standard answers. Example: For the question "Is Rutgers University or Brown University public?", the system returns "Rutgers University is public and Brown University is private." instead of the expected "Rutgers University."
    *   **Direct Snippet Usage:** The system tends to directly use snippets from the source documents without proper summarization or simplification, leading to verbose answers.

| 001           | 2024-11-20 | Baseline: Direct LLM call with minimal prompt engineering. The prompt simply provides the question and supporting documents and asks the LLM to answer.                                                                                                                                                                                             | Direct LLM call with question and supporting documents.                                                    | 80% Accuracy (on a sample of X questions).

| 004           | [DATE]     | Multi-Stage Verification with Self-Critique | Analysis, answer generation, critique, refinement, validation | Insufficient accuracy. Critique and refinement steps do not effectively address the underlying problem of weak semantic understanding.

Model struggles to extract the correct answer, even when it appears to have performed the correct reasoning. |
| 008           | [DATE]     | Multi-stage LLM approach with specialized agent roles. | Question analyzer, retrieval prompt designer, answer expert, and answer validator. | 80% Accuracy. | Multi-stage LLM approach shows promise but needs refinement in the answer validation stage to prevent incorrect inferences. Simply identifying relevant documents and extracting information is insufficient; the system needs a more robust reasoning engine. |
| 009           | [DATE]     | Refining the Multi-stage LLM approach with self-reflection | Question analysis, retrieval prompt designer, answer expert, and answer validator with self-reflection loop. | [Accuracy data needed] | Self-reflection helps, but not enough. Explicit document elimination is helpful. |
| 010           | [DATE]     | Test iterative refinement with fact checker | Question analysis, prompt design, fact checking, answer generation, and validation. | 1.00 Accuracy | Confirms iterative refinement with fact checker can be highly accurate but can lead to verbose answers. |

*Detailed notes on Experiment 001:*

*   The prompt used was a basic concatenation of the question and supporting documents.
*   The LLM used was [Specify the LLM used - e.g., GPT-4, Llama 2, etc.].
*   Runtime was [Specify runtime - e.g., average 5 seconds per question].
*   Error analysis revealed that the model frequently hallucinated information or provided answers based on its pre-trained knowledge rather than the provided documents. Specific examples are documented in the "Failure Modes" section.

*Detailed notes on Experiment 012:*

*   During execution, the system encountered script errors during script repair. Specifically:
    *   `[2025-05-31 03:08:05]`: `ERROR: Could not parse question analysis.`
    *   `[2025-05-31 03:08:17]`: `ERROR: Could not determine the final answer.`
*   The "Tara Strong" question showed the system identified documents mentioning Tara Strong and Teen Titans, but failed to isolate the *specific* series requested in the question.
*   The error examples show an inability to connect facts across documents to derive the correct answer.

*Detailed notes on Experiment 015:*

* The ReAct agent incorrectly identified "Richard DeVos" as the founder of Van Andel Institute, due to the document mentioning him as a co-founder of Amway alongside Jay Van Andel.

*Detailed notes on Experiment 017:*

* The system provides verbose answers including supporting evidence from documents, while the gold answer is often a single word or a short phrase.

*Detailed notes on Experiment 018:*

* The LLM identifies relevant documents and performs a logical connection but fails to isolate the most precise answer requested.

*Detailed notes on Experiment 019:*

* The agent not prioritizing information retrieval in cases when it is appropriate, rather than providing a reasoned response.

*Detailed notes on Experiment 020:*

* The system struggled to differentiate between dates.

*Detailed notes on Experiment 021:*

* The system failed on questions

*Detailed notes on Experiment 027:*

* The system incorrectly associated "Weider Publications" (the publisher) with the "founder" of the magazine.
* The system incorrectly answers "Bolton" instead of "Rivington Moor".
* The inability to determine relationships between entities and determine importance of information leads to incorrect answer extraction.

*Detailed notes on Experiment 028:*

* Confirms the hypothesis that multi-hop reasoning can be approached with question decomposition and evidence aggregation.
* Implementation reveals that this approach is highly sensitive to the quality of the sub-questions and the precision of the synthesis stage.
* System struggled to provide definitive "yes" or "no" answers, often providing additional context or misinterpreting the question's intent.
* The "Hungry Hungry Hippos" question highlights the system's inability to determine which entity was the original producer of both games, rather than whether one company produces both *now*.

*Detailed notes on Experiment 029:*

* Even with chain-of-thought prompting, the "expert at concisely extracting info" role in the `verification_prompt` is insufficient to consistently produce concise answers matching the gold standard. Example: For the question "Is Rutgers University or Brown University public?", the system returns "Rutgers University is public and Brown University is private." instead of the expected "Rutgers University."

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Enhance Answer Simplification:** Modify the `verification_prompt` to explicitly instruct the LLM to shorten the answer and remove any information not directly answering the question. For example, the prompt could include phrases such as "Provide the shortest possible answer" or "Only state X."
*   **Enhance Format Adherence:** Include examples of the desired answer format in the `verification_prompt` to guide the LLM towards producing outputs that match the golden answers. This could involve providing a few question-answer pairs demonstrating the expected conciseness.
*   **Add Negative Examples:** Add negative examples in the prompt indicating information that should *not* be included in the answer. For example, "Do not mention any other entities besides the one directly asked about in the question."
*   **Enhance Entity Linking:** Implement a dedicated entity linking module to explicitly identify and connect entities across documents. This module should prioritize direct relationships expressed in the text.
*   **Refine Information Extraction:** Develop more robust information extraction techniques that can accurately identify and extract relevant information, even when

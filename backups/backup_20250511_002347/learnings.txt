# Grid Transformation Task: Dataset-Specific Learning Log

This document serves as a continuously updated log of our findings, strategies, and experiments related to the grid transformation task using LLMs. It prioritizes specific insights applicable to this dataset over general system design principles.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Task Definition:** The task involves transforming a "TEST INPUT" grid based on transformation rules inferred from provided "Input Grid" and "Output Grid" training examples. The task is presented as text. Each problem includes training examples (input and output grids) and a test input grid that needs to be transformed. The task emphasizes spatial reasoning over simple symbol manipulation.
*   **Grid Format:** Grids are consistently represented as 2D arrays of numerical values. Input grids, output grids, and test grids are all represented in the same format. Grids are represented as nested lists of integers within the text.
*   **Numerical Values:** Grids predominantly contain numerical values. Specific values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8) appear frequently and may hold semantic significance within the transformations. '0' is frequently used as a background value.
*   **Grid Size Variance:** The dimensions (rows and columns) of grids vary significantly across questions, adding complexity to pattern recognition. Grids can be square or rectangular, and the size relationship between input and output grids is inconsistent. The training examples and test input within a single problem instance have consistent dimensions.
*   **Transformation Complexity:** Transformation rules are implicit and must be inferred from a limited number of examples. The complexity of these rules varies significantly. Transformations can involve scaling, shifting, element replacement, conditional logic, or combinations thereof. The transformation logic involves replacing certain numbers in the input grid with other numbers, based on patterns observed in the training examples. The transformations are often localized (e.g., affecting numbers within a certain proximity of another number). Transformations are not always 1:1 (a single input cell value may result in different output cell values depending on context), and there may be several changes happening at once. The value of a cell in the output grid may depend on the values of multiple cells in the input grid and their spatial relationships (e.g., neighbors, patterns). Examples illustrate a variety of transformation types, including arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction), pattern replication, mirroring, rotations, and neighbor-dependent changes. Some transformations involve repeating rows and columns.
*   **Inconsistent Training Examples:** The number of training examples provided is limited, making it difficult to generalize transformation rules to the test input. The training examples provided may not fully cover all aspects of the transformation rule, increasing the difficulty of pattern extraction.
*   **Symmetry Considerations:** Some transformations exhibit symmetry, while others are asymmetrical, treating rows and columns differently. Analyzing symmetry can be a useful initial step.
*   **Value Dependency:** Transformations can depend on the specific values within the grid. For example, '0' might be treated differently from '1'.
*   **Potential Size Changes:** While less frequent, transformations could potentially involve changing the grid size (adding or removing rows/columns).
*   **Multi-element Relationships:** The transformations are not always simple one-to-one mappings. The value of a cell in the output grid may depend on the values of multiple cells in the input grid and their spatial relationships (e.g., neighbors, patterns).
*   **Variety in Transformation Logic:** The examples illustrate a variety of transformation types. Some involve arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction), while others involve pattern replication or more complex spatial logic (e.g., mirroring, rotations, neighbor-dependent changes).

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **N/A (Accuracy Consistently 0.00):** As of the latest experiments, no strategies have demonstrably improved accuracy on this dataset. Previous approaches relying solely on LLM prompt engineering for rule extraction, inference, and application have consistently failed. The initial exploitation strategy yields no success, which suggests that the LLM needs more explicit guidance to handle the spatial reasoning and pattern generalization required. The intended strategy of inferring and applying localized transformation rules is a reasonable starting point, given the patterns identified in the dataset.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Pattern Misidentification:** The LLM frequently fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation pattern, indicating a misunderstanding of how values are spatially related within the grid.
    *   *Example:* The LLM produced a grid with 2's in positions (0,0) and (2,0), while the expected output had 2's in positions (0,0) and (0,2).
*   **Inability to Generalize:** The LLM struggles to generalize observed patterns from training examples to the test input, failing to consistently apply learned transformation rules to new, unseen data.
    *   *Example:* The output grid contains a seemingly arbitrary arrangement of numbers bearing little resemblance to the expected output, demonstrating the model's inability to consistently apply learned transformation rules to unseen data. The system struggles to generalize from limited training examples and fails when the transformation logic in the test input deviates even slightly from the patterns seen in the training set. This overfitting to specific examples leads to failures.
*   **Hallucination of Patterns:** The LLM sometimes generates transformations that are not supported by the training examples, indicating hallucination of non-existent patterns.
*   **Incorrect Spatial Reasoning:** The LLM struggles with spatial reasoning tasks, such as identifying neighboring cells or applying transformations based on cell location. The LLM fails to recognize how elements in one part of the grid influence elements in another, or how patterns should be propagated across the grid.
*   **Output Format Correctness, Content Incorrect:** While the LLM correctly formats the output as a 2D array string, the content of the output grid is invariably incorrect, demonstrating that the issue is in grid transformation logic, not formatting.
*   **Ignoring Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** The LLM often fails to correctly handle edge cases, such as cells at the edges of the grid.
*   **Failure to Infer Transformation Rules:** The system fails to accurately infer the transformation rules from the training examples, producing completely different numerical arrays than the expected ones. This is likely because the LLM struggles to understand complex spatial relationships and number patterns within the grids and extrapolate those patterns correctly.
    *   *Concrete Finding:* The complexity of transformation from input to output is too much given the current methodology.
*   **Generation of Arbitrary Number Sequences:** The LLM generates arbitrary number sequences in the output that are not based on the training data, suggesting a failure in understanding the underlying logic of the grid transformations.
*   **Inconsistent Information Extraction and Application:** The system incorrectly extracts information and applies transformation rules, which leads to inconsistent results.
*   **Inability to identify transformation rules:** The LLM struggles to accurately deduce the transformation rules from the training examples. This is evident in the "Unable to transform the grid correctly" error messages, indicating the LLM couldn't extract the underlying logic.
*   **Poor generalization:** Even if the LLM could identify the rules for the training examples, it fails to generalize them to the test input. The error examples show the LLM doesn't apply the learnt rules correctly.
*   **Output format mismatch:** In some cases, the LLM produced an output with a completely different structure than the expected grid format, indicating a misunderstanding of the task requirements or an inability to consistently apply the transformation process.
*   **Fragile Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to generalize from limited training examples. It fails when the transformation logic in the test input deviates even slightly from the patterns seen in the training set. This happens because the system overfits to the specific examples provided.
*   **Unreliable Code Generation:** Even when the underlying pattern is partially understood, errors in code generation can lead to incorrect transformations. The generated code may contain logical flaws or incorrect indexing that produce unintended results.
*   **Difficulty with Complex Spatial Relationships:** The system struggles when the transformation logic involves complex spatial relationships between grid elements. For example, identifying and replicating patterns that depend on the values of neighboring cells proves challenging.
*   **Incorrect application of patterns:** Even when the LLM identifies the "right" patterns, it fails to apply the patterns correctly in the target grid, leading to a wrong answer, often manifested in numerical differences or the generation of unstructured grid.
*   **Limited Contextual Understanding:** The LLM's performance is severely limited by its inability to understand the contextual meaning of the numbers within the grid and their relationships.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Experiment 0 (Initial Exploitation):**
    *   *Description:* Attempted to solve the task using direct prompt engineering, providing the LLM with examples and explicit system instructions for extraction, inference, transformation, and verification.
    *   *Result:* Accuracy 0.00.
    *   *Finding:* Prompt engineering alone is insufficient for this task. The LLM needs more explicit guidance or a different approach to handle the spatial reasoning and pattern generalization required. The initial hypothesis that the LLM, guided by explicit system instructions for extraction, inference, transformation, and verification, can effectively solve these grid transformation problems is rejected.
*   **General Finding:** The current implementation is consistently failing, with an accuracy of 0.00. This indicates a fundamental problem with the approach being used. The experimental approach of relying on the LLM's general pattern-recognition abilities, without specific guidance on grid transformations, does not work. The 0.0 accuracy indicates the LLM is unable to learn and apply the grid transformation logic effectively from the given training examples. The hypothesis that an LLM, acting as a general expert, can solve these problems without more specific prompting or fine-tuning is rejected. The LLM needs additional guidance to correctly solve grid transformation tasks.
*   **Iteration 2 Results:** The LLM, in its current configuration and prompting, is unable to effectively perform grid transformation tasks based on the provided training examples. The exploration approach, which relies on the LLM's reasoning and pattern-matching capabilities, has failed to yield any successful results. The hypothesis that the LLM can infer and apply localized transformation rules directly from the given prompt is rejected. The examples show that the LLM doesn't extract the relevant information from the training examples and/or doesn't know how to apply those rules to new grid configurations.
*   **Iteration 3 Results:** The pure exploration strategy, without any prior knowledge or constraints, resulted in complete failure (0.00 accuracy). This suggests that the search space for grid transformations is too vast to be explored effectively without guidance. Relying solely on an LLM's inherent spatial reasoning abilities is not enough to solve these problems. The LLM needs to be guided by more specific instructions and constraints.
*   **Iteration 4 Results:**
    *   *Description:* LLM-driven approach to transform grids by identifying and reinforcing localized patterns. Single agent role: "expert at identifying localized patterns".
    *   *Result:* Accuracy 0.00.
    *   *Finding:* The "LLM-driven approach to transform grids by identifying and reinforcing localized patterns" proves ineffective in its current implementation. Relying on a single agent role ("expert at identifying localized patterns") is insufficient for this task. The problem requires a more nuanced approach that combines pattern identification, spatial reasoning, and rule application, potentially requiring multiple specialized agents or a more sophisticated agent design. The hypothesis that an LLM, even with localized pattern reinforcement, can effectively solve these grid transformation problems is rejected.
*   **Script Error Log (2025-05-09):**
    *   05:26:33: `ERROR: Grid transformation error` (Attempt 1 during script repair)
    *   05:26:40: `ERROR: google.genai has no attribute 'configure'` (Attempt 2 during script repair)
    *   05:26:52: `ERROR: Gemini API call failed with a 404 error, indicating the model was not found or not supported.` (Attempt 3 during script repair)
    *   05:29:26: `ERROR: Unable to transform the grid correctly.` (Attempt 1 during script repair)
    *   *Finding:* Script repair attempts reveal issues with API calls, model configuration, and general transformation errors, highlighting the fragility of the current implementation and the need for more robust error handling and API version management.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

Given the consistent failure of prompt-based approaches, the following research directions should be explored:

*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Experiment with a multi-agent architecture. One agent could focus on pattern extraction (identifying repeating elements, symmetries, or arithmetic relationships). Another could specialize in spatial reasoning (understanding how patterns propagate and interact). A final agent could focus on verification/validation to ensure the transformed grid adheres to the identified rules.
*   **Refine the Prompting Strategy:**
    *   Explicitly instruct the LLM to identify *relationships* between numbers and positions in the training grids.
    *   Use specific keywords related to *spatial reasoning*, such as "adjacent," "row," "column," "neighbor," and "distance".
    *   Prompt the LLM to verbalize the transformation rule it infers before applying it to the test grid. This will allow us to audit the LLM's reasoning process.
*   **Break Down the Problem Further:**
    *   Instead of a single prompt for the entire transformation, create separate prompts for identifying the transformation rule for *each unique number* in the input grid.
    *   Consider pre-processing the grid data to highlight differences between input and output grids in the training examples (e.g., create a "difference grid").
*   **Implement External Verification and Correction:**
    *   Develop a simple Python function to check if the transformed grid adheres to basic constraints (e.g., if a certain number *always* appears in a specific location).
    *   Use this function to provide feedback to the LLM if the transformation is invalid.
*   **Enhanced Pattern Representation:**
    *   Explore methods for explicitly encoding grid transformation patterns, such as representing transformations as mathematical functions or algorithms operating on grid coordinates and values, rather than relying solely on the LLM's implicit understanding.
    *   Develop a structured representation for transformation rules, potentially using a domain-specific language (DSL) or a set of predefined operators.
*   **Decomposition and Intermediate Steps:**
    *   Break down the transformation process into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
    *   Ask the LLM to explicitly identify key features, relationships, and operations involved in the transformation, storing these outputs as intermediate variables for more detailed output.
    *   Focus on having the LLM *describe* the transformation in a step-by-step manner, using a controlled vocabulary for grid operations (e.g., "replace", "shift", "copy", "reflect", "invert", "neighbor", "adjacent", "row", "column").
*   **Iterative Refinement:**
    *   Implement a loop where the LLM proposes a transformation, evaluates its correctness on the training examples, and refines the transformation based on the evaluation results.
    *   Provide feedback to the LLM by pointing out specific cells that were transformed incorrectly, guiding it towards a more accurate transformation rule.
*   **Hybrid Approach:**
    *   Combine the LLM with symbolic reasoning or search algorithms.
    *   Use the LLM for high-level pattern recognition and feature extraction, but delegate the actual grid manipulation to a more specialized algorithm.
*   **Targeted Training:**
    *   Fine-tune the LLM on a dataset specifically designed for grid transformation tasks.
    *   This could involve generating synthetic data or curating a dataset of existing grid puzzles.
*   **Difference Grids and Symmetry Analysis:**
    *   Calculate the difference between the input and output grids to reveal underlying patterns.
    *   Check for symmetry in the input and output grids, as symmetrical transformations are often easier to identify.
*   **Value Frequency Analysis:**
    *   Analyze the frequency of different values in the input and output grids to reveal which values are being transformed into others.
*   **Explore Few-Shot Learning:**
    *   Experiment with providing a larger number of training examples within the prompt to improve the LLM's ability to generalize.
    *   Carefully select training examples that cover a range of possible transformations.
    *   Group grid transformation tasks by type and create a few-shot prompting regime that provides similar examples to the test case.
    *   Test additional few-shot examples in the prompt, potentially increasing the number of examples to showcase the patterns better.
*   **Prompting Strategies to Avoid:** Avoid prompting the LLM to directly generate code (e.g., Python) to perform the grid transformation, as this often leads to syntax errors and incorrect logic.
*   **Improve rule extraction:** Implement a more robust rule extraction mechanism. This might involve techniques like:
    *   Explicitly prompting the LLM to list the transformation rules in a structured format before applying them.
    *   Incorporating a separate module to analyze the training examples and identify potential rules, which are then fed to the LLM.
*   **Enhance local transformation reasoning:**
    *   Experiment with different prompting strategies focusing on neighborhood analysis.
    *   Provide the LLM with a specific way of reasoning about transformations.
*   **Implement iterative verification:** Since the transformations are all happening at once, add an iterative verification step to the transformation application to allow for refinement.
*   **Add specific tests:** Create test cases for specific errors.
*   **Introduce Constraints:** Explicitly define constraints on the possible transformations, such as the types of operations that can be applied (addition, mirroring, rotation) and the scope of spatial relationships to consider (neighboring cells, diagonals). This will narrow the search space and improve the likelihood of finding a valid transformation.
*   **Implement a Verification Mechanism:** Develop a mechanism to verify the correctness of the transformed grid before returning it as the final answer. This could involve checking for consistency with the training examples or applying sanity checks based on known grid properties.
*   **Implement Targeted Refinement:** After generating an initial transformation, analyze the result and identify specific areas where it deviates from the expected pattern. Then, apply targeted refinements to correct these errors.
*   **Focus on Simpler Pattern Types:** Start by focusing on simpler types of grid transformations that involve more obvious patterns (e.g., row/column repetition, simple arithmetic operations). Gradually increase the complexity of the patterns as the system's performance improves.
*   **Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data by creating variations of the existing examples. This could involve rotating, mirroring, or slightly modifying the grids to expose the LLM to a wider range of pattern variations.

During a scoreless third quarter, a would be long TD-run from Ray Rice was negated by a controversial call of a penalty on Anquan Boldin.

He was considered to be a weak, incompetent ruler, especially after British, Russian and Ottoman occupations of Persia during World War I. In 1911, when the capital city, Tehran, had been seized by the Russians, armed Bakhtiaris tribemen, rather than Iranian regular troops, expelled the invaders. This further diminished the government's reputation, rendering it almost powerless in time of war. Britain, which played a major role in Persia, was dismayed by the Qajar government's inability to rule efficiently. This inefficiency was the background of a power struggle between Britain and Russia, each nation hoping to control Persia. On 14 January 1921, the British General Ironside chose to promote Reza Khan, who had been leading the Tabriz battalion, to lead the entire brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan's 3,000-4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade reached Tehran.\n\nQUESTION: Which event happened first, The march on Tehran or the corruption of the Qajar dynasty of Persia?\n    Answer: The march on Tehran\n\n    Passage: In late 1920, the Persian Soviet Socialist Republic in Rasht was preparing to march on Tehran with \"a guerrilla force of 1,500 Jangalis, Kurds, Armenians and Azerbaijanis\", reinforced by the Bolsheviks' Red Army.

Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The opening day of the offensive  was the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead.

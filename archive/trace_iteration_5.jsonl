Since $\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{u}$, the dot product of $\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}$ with $\\mathbf{u}$ will be zero.\n\n8. **Maximize the expression:** The result from step 7 will likely involve the magnitude of $\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}.$  Recall that $|\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}| = |\\mathbf{u}| |\\mathbf{v}| \\sin \\theta = \\sin \\theta,$ where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}.$  Maximize the expression with respect to $\\sin \\theta$ (or $\\theta$).\n\n        Solutions: Okay, I'm ready to solve the sub-problems.\n\n1. **Understand the given information:** $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are unit vectors, meaning $|\\mathbf{u}| = |\\mathbf{v}| = 1$. Also, $\\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{v}$.\n\n2. **Take the dot product with u:** Dotting both sides of $\\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{v}$ with $\\mathbf{u}$ yields\n   $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$.\n   Since the dot product distributes over addition, we have $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$.  The scalar triple product $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = 0$, so $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$.\n\n3. **Isolate u.w:** From the previous step, we have $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$.\n\n4. **Take the cross product with u:** Crossing both sides of $\\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{v}$ with $\\mathbf{u}$ gives $\\mathbf{u} \\times (\\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}$, so $\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{u} \\times (\\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}$.\n\n5. **Simplify the triple vector product:** Using the vector triple product identity, $\\mathbf{u} \\times (\\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) \\mathbf{w} - (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) \\mathbf{u}$. Since $\\mathbf{u}$ is a unit vector, $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = |\\mathbf{u}|^2 = 1$. Thus, $\\mathbf{u} \\times (\\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{w} - (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) \\mathbf{u}$.\n\n6. **Express w in terms of u and u x v:** Substituting the result from Step 5 into the result of Step 4, we have $\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{w} - (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}$.  Substituting $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ (from Step 3), we get $\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{w} - (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}$.\nAlso, from the original equation, $\\mathbf{w} \\times \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{w}$.  Taking the negative of both sides gives $\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{v}$.\nSubstituting this into the previous equation, we get $(\\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{v}) + \\mathbf{w} - (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}$, so $2\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{w} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v})$.\n\n7. **Calculate (u x v).w:**  We have\n   $(\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}) = \\frac{1}{2} ( (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{u} + (\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v})$.\nSince $(\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v})$ is orthogonal to both $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$, $(\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$ and $(\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$.\nThus, $(\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\frac{1}{2} | \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v} |^2$.\n\n8. **Maximize the expression:** We have $|\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}| = |\\mathbf{u}| |\\mathbf{v}| \\sin \\theta = \\sin \\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$. Therefore, $(\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sin^2 \\theta$.  The maximum value of $\\sin^2 \\theta$ is 1, which occurs when $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the maximum value of $(\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{w}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1/2}$\n\n        Final Answer:\n        ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert at synthesizing solutions to math problems."}, "output": "The largest possible value of $(\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot \\mathbf{w}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n", "status": "success"}

Also, $\\sin \\alpha = -\\frac{\\cos \\beta \\sin \\beta + \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta}{\\cos \\beta}$.\n    Substituting into the target expression,\n    $\\frac{\\cos^3 \\beta}{\\cos \\alpha} + \\frac{\\sin^3 \\beta}{\\sin \\alpha} = \\frac{\\cos^3 \\beta}{-\\frac{\\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta + \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta}{\\sin \\beta}} + \\frac{\\sin^3 \\beta}{-\\frac{\\cos \\beta \\sin \\beta + \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta}{\\cos \\beta}} = \\frac{-\\cos^3 \\beta \\sin \\beta}{\\cos \\beta(\\sin \\beta + \\sin \\alpha)} + \\frac{-\\sin^3 \\beta \\cos \\beta}{\\sin \\beta (\\cos \\beta + \\cos \\alpha)} = \\frac{-\\cos^2 \\beta \\sin \\beta}{\\sin \\beta + \\sin \\alpha} + \\frac{-\\sin^2 \\beta \\cos \\beta}{\\cos \\beta + \\cos \\alpha}$.\n    We can write $\\frac{\\cos \\alpha}{\\cos \\beta} = -1 - \\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{\\sin \\beta}$, so $\\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta = - \\cos \\beta \\sin \\beta - \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta$, which we already know.\n\n4. From $\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sin(2\\beta) = -\\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta$, we have $\\alpha + \\beta = \\arcsin(-\\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta)$, so $\\alpha = \\arcsin(-\\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta) - \\beta$.\nAlso, $\\frac{\\cos \\alpha}{\\cos \\beta} + \\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{\\sin \\beta} = -1$, so $\\frac{\\cos \\alpha}{\\cos \\beta} = -1 - \\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{\\sin \\beta}$.\n$\\cos \\alpha \\sin \\beta + \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\beta = - \\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta$, so $\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) = - \\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta$.\nNow, consider the case where $\\alpha = \\pi/2$ and $\\beta = 3\\pi/4$. Then $\\cos \\alpha = 0$ and $\\sin \\alpha = 1$, while $\\cos \\beta = - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\\sin \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. In this case, the equation becomes $0 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}/2} = \\sqrt{2} \\ne -1$.\n\nConsider $\\frac{\\cos^3 \\beta}{\\cos \\alpha} + \\frac{\\sin^3 \\beta}{\\sin \\alpha} = 1$. We want to check this.\n\nSuppose $\\beta = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$. Then $\\sin \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\\cos \\beta = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta) = -\\sin \\beta \\cos \\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so $\\alpha + \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\arcsin(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4})$. Then $\\alpha = \\arcsin(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}) - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\n$\\cos \\alpha = \\cos(\\arcsin(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}) - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) = \\cos(\\arcsin(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4})) \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) + \\sin(\\arcsin(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4})) \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) = \\sqrt{1-\\frac{3}{16}} (-\\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}) (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = - \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{8} + \\frac{3}{8}$.\n$\\sin \\alpha = \\sin(\\arcsin(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}) - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) = \\sin(\\arcsin(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4})) \\cos(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) - \\cos(\\arcsin(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4})) \\sin(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4})(-\\frac{1}{2}) - (\\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{4})(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8} - \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{8}$.\n\n$\\frac{\\cos \\alpha}{\\cos \\beta} + \\frac{\\sin \\alpha}{\\sin \\beta} = \\frac{-\\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{8} + \\frac{3}{8}}{-\\frac{1}{2}} + \\frac{-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{8} - \\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{8}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{13} - 3}{4} + \\frac{-\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{39}}{4\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{13}-3}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{4} = -1$.\nSo $\\frac{\\cos^3 \\beta}{\\cos \\alpha} + \\frac{\\sin^3 \\beta}{\\sin \\alpha} = \\frac{(-\\frac{1}{2})^3}{\\frac{3-\\sqrt{13}}{8}} + \\frac{(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^3}{\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}-\\sqrt{39}}{8}} = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{3-\\sqrt{13}}{8}} + \\frac{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}}{\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}(1+\\sqrt{13})}{8}} = \\frac{-1}{3-\\sqrt{13}} + \\frac{3}{-(1+\\sqrt{13})} = \\frac{-3 - 3\\sqrt{13}+3 - \\sqrt{13}}{3\\cdot 3 - 13}= \\frac{-4\\sqrt{13}}{-4} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{13}} = 1$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{1}$\n        Final Answer:\n        ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert at synthesizing solutions to math problems."}, "output": "The final answer is 1.\n", "status": "success"}

This will create a quadratic equation.**\n\n    Substituting the expression for $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{c}$ into the equation from Step 4, we get:\n\n    $\\|\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2 - 2 \\|\\mathbf{a}\\| \\|\\mathbf{c}\\| \\cos \\theta + \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2$\n    $\\|\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2 - 2 (3) \\|\\mathbf{c}\\| \\left(\\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{25}{\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2}}\\right) + 3^2$\n    $\\|\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2 \\pm 6 \\|\\mathbf{c}\\| \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{25}{\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2}} + 9$\n    $\\|\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2 \\mp 6 \\sqrt{\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2 - 25} + 9$\n\n    Let $x = \\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2$, then $\\|\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}\\|^2 = x \\mp 6 \\sqrt{x-25} + 9$\n\n7.  **Determine the possible values of $\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|$ based on the information available.**\n\nFrom step 2, we have $\\sin \\theta = \\frac{5}{\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|}$.  Since $|\\sin \\theta| \\le 1$, we must have $\\frac{5}{\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|} \\le 1$, so $\\|\\mathbf{c}\\| \\ge 5$. Also, since the term under the square root in step 6 must be non-negative, we need $x-25 \\ge 0$, so $x \\ge 25$ and $\\|\\mathbf{c}\\| \\ge 5$.\n\n8.  **Minimize the expression for $\\|\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}\\|^2$ (from Step 6) with respect to $\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|.$ This will involve finding the vertex of a quadratic.**\n\nInstead of completing the square, let us differentiate the original expression $\\|\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2 \\mp 6 \\sqrt{\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2 - 25} + 9$\n\nLetting $y = \\|\\mathbf{c}\\|$, $\\|\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}\\|^2 = y^2 \\mp 6 \\sqrt{y^2 - 25} + 9$.\n\nTaking derivative wrt to y: $\\frac{d}{dy}(\\|\\mathbf{c} - \\mathbf{a}\\|^2)=2y \\mp 6\\frac{2y}{2\\sqrt{y^2-25}}=2y\\mp \\frac{6y}{\\sqrt{y^2-25}}$\n\nSet to zero, $2y = \\pm\\frac{6y}{\\sqrt{y^2-25}}$. If $y=0$, then $\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|=0$. This cannot be true, since $\\|\\mathbf{c}\\| \\ge 5$.\n\nThus, $2=\\pm\\frac{6}{\\sqrt{y^2-25}}$\n$4 = \\frac{36}{y^2-25}$.\n$4y^2-100=36$\n$4y^2=136$\n$y^2=34$\n$y=\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|=\\sqrt{34}$.\n\n$\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2 = 34$.

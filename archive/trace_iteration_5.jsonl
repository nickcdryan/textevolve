This fact, along with various other disorders, mutinies and unrest in the country created \"an acute political crisis in the capital.\" By 1921, the ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia had become corrupt and inefficient. The oil-rich nation was somewhat reliant on the nations of Britain and Russia for military and economic support. Civil wars earlier in the decade had threatened the government, and the only regular military force at the time was the Cossack Brigade. The Qajar shah in 1921 was Ahmad, who had been crowned at the age of eleven. He was considered to be a weak, incompetent ruler, especially after British, Russian and Ottoman occupations of Persia during World War I.

Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The opening day of the offensive  was the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000. Gun fire wasn't the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. The living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as trench foot, shell shock, blindness/burns from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, cooties  and the \u2018Spanish Flu'.\n\nQUESTION: How many months did germans attack french positions?\n        Synthesized Answer: 10 months\n\n\n        Example 1:\n        Original Question: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?\n        Synthesized Answer: 59 yards\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Example 2:\n        Original Question: Who caught the final touchdown of the game?\n        Synthesized Answer: Wes Welker\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Is the answer correct and complete?

On 14 May, three days after his poclamation, Shefqet Turgut Pasha ordered his troops to seize De\u010di\u0107, hill that overlooked Tuzi. Sixty Albanian chieftains rejected Turgut Pasha's proclamation on their meeting in Podgorica on 18 May. After almost a month of intense fightings rebels were trapped and their only choices were either to die fighting, to surrender or to flee to Montenegro. Most of the rebels chose to flee to Montenegro which became a base for large number of rebels determined to attack the Ottoman Empire. Ismail Kemal Bey and Tiranli Cemal bey traveled from Italy to Montenegro at the end of May and met the rebels to convince them to adopt the nationalistic agenda which they eventually did. On 12 June Porte prematurely proclaimed that the revolt had ended.\n\nQUESTION: How many months after the chieftains rejected Turgut Pasha's proclamation did Porte proclaim the revolt had ended?\n        Synthesized Answer: 1 month\n\n\n        Example 1:\n        Original Question: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?\n        Synthesized Answer: 59 yards\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Example 2:\n        Original Question: Who caught the final touchdown of the game?\n        Synthesized Answer: Wes Welker\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Is the answer correct and complete?

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions by analyzing the question, extracting relevant information, generating an initial answer, and then verifying it. It decomposes the problem into four main steps: question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The agent roles are defined implicitly through system instructions, such as \"expert at analyzing questions\" or \"expert at verifying answers,\" guiding the LLM's behavior in each function. The script uses `analyze_question` to determine question type and keywords, `extract_relevant_passage` to find the most relevant text, `generate_answer` to produce an answer, and `verify_answer` to validate the answer, with `call_llm` serving as the underlying function to interact with the Gemini LLM for each step. The overall workflow involves sequentially calling these functions, passing the output of one as input to the next, to arrive at a verified answer.",

The Turks almost captured Vienna, but John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna , stalling the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Venetian Republic in 1684, joined by Russia in 1686.

Baltimore took flight in the first half with kicker Steven Hauschka nailing a 43-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 35-yard field goal in the second quarter.  The Ravens would immediately make their domination felt in the third quarter as rookie cornerback Lardarius Webb returned the second half's opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown.  The Broncos would get on the board with running back Knowshon Moreno getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet Baltimore answered with Hauschka booting a 31-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Ravens closed the game out in the fourth quarter as quarterback Joe Flacco found wide receiver Derrick Mason on a 20-yard touchdown pass, while running back Ray Rice got a 7-yard touchdown run.",

However, it fails to explicitly state or calculate the total points when a question asks about the touchdown. The logic exists to extract the answer, but the final calculation/conclusion is missing.\n*   **Sample ID 1 (Success Case):** Demonstrates correct information extraction, date comparison, and successful explanation of the reasoning.\n*   **Sample ID 2 (Success Case):** The reasoning to arrive at Kris Brown is correct, however, the system incorrectly thinks the original answer was Jay Feeley. This could be a problem where the system is hallucinating.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system exhibits good capabilities in information extraction, basic logical reasoning, and step-by-step solution generation. However, it struggles with completing the last step of reasoning needed to produce the final answer, particularly when it involves simple arithmetic or combining extracted facts. The system also appears to suffer from hallucination.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Consistently extracts relevant information from the input text.\n*   **Basic Logical Reasoning:** Capable of date comparisons, ordering, and other elementary logical operations.\n*   **Step-by-Step Solution Generation:** Able to break down the reasoning process into intermediate steps.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incomplete Reasoning Chains:** Fails to complete the final step in multi-step reasoning processes.\n*   **Lack of arithmetic reasoning**: Unable to perform even basic arithmetic reasoning\n*   **Hallucination**: Sometimes hallucinating information not in the original answer.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **completing reasoning chains**, specifically ensuring the system arrives at the final, explicit answer when all the necessary information has been extracted and processed. Improving arithmetic reasoning is also important.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Data Augmentation for Multi-Step Reasoning:**\n    *   Create more training examples where the answer requires explicitly combining extracted information with a simple calculation or logical inference.\n    *   Label these examples meticulously, paying close attention to the final answer derivation.\n    *   Use techniques like back-translation or paraphrasing to create diverse variations of these examples.\n\n2.  **Output Formatting Enforcement:**\n    *   Train the system to ALWAYS include a clearly marked \"FINAL ANSWER:\" or \"CONCLUSION:\" section at the end of its reasoning process.\n    *   This will encourage the system to explicitly state the final answer and reduce the likelihood of stopping short.\n    *   Add a post-processing step to check for the presence of this \"FINAL ANSWER:\" section and flag outputs that are missing it.\n\n3.  **Fine-tuning with Negative Examples:**\n    *   Create negative examples where the system is deliberately given an incomplete reasoning chain.\n    *   Train the system to identify these incomplete chains and explicitly state what is missing to reach the final answer.\n    *   For instance, in the example above the model could say \"I have identified that touchdowns are worth 6 points.

(Evidenced by success cases 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)\n2.  **Logical Reasoning:** The system can perform basic logical reasoning, such as comparing dates (case 1) and performing arithmetic (case 6).\n3.  **Step-by-step solution generation:** As evidenced in success cases, the system can successfully generate intermediate steps that help towards the final correct answer.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Misinterpretation of Question Intent:** The system sometimes fails to fully understand what the question is asking, leading to an incorrect answer. (Error case 0)\n2.  **Lack of contextual awareness**: When the question requires further reasoning on top of the extraction, the system struggles to reach the final answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Understanding Implicit Information:** The inability to correctly interpret implied meaning or context in the question.\n2.  **Limited Multi-Step Reasoning:** Struggles with questions requiring several reasoning steps beyond simple extraction and arithmetic.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Missing answer**: Error case 0 shows the system fails to take the final step from 'touchdowns are worth 6 points' to the answer which is likely 7.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the system's **inability to perform the last step of reasoning** after extracting relevant information, leading to missed or incomplete answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Question Understanding:** Improved ability to interpret the intent of the question, including understanding implicit information and context.\n2.  **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Enhancement of the system's ability to chain together multiple reasoning steps to reach the final answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Add more examples to finetune the model:** The model can benefit from more training examples where questions require one step beyond simple extraction.\n2.  **Refine output formatting:** Ensure the final answer is explicitly stated at the end of the reasoning process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** solution_generation, decision_making\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and my understanding as a System Capability Analyst:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**SYSTEM:** AI Reasoning System (Name not explicitly provided, assuming internal system)\n**VERSION:** (Assuming initial version or a recent iteration)\n**DATE:** October 26, 2023\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs reveal the following:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (Error Case):**  The system identifies the relevant information that a touchdown is worth 6 points. However, it fails to explicitly state or calculate the total points when a question asks about the touchdown. The logic exists to extract the answer, but the final calculation/conclusion is missing.\n*   **Sample ID 1 (Success Case):** Demonstrates correct information extraction, date comparison, and successful explanation of the reasoning.\n*   **Sample ID 2 (Success Case):** The reasoning to arrive at Kris Brown is correct, however, the system incorrectly thinks the original answer was Jay Feeley. This could be a problem where the system is hallucinating.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system exhibits good capabilities in information extraction, basic logical reasoning, and step-by-step solution generation. However, it struggles with completing the last step of reasoning needed to produce the final answer, particularly when it involves simple arithmetic or combining extracted facts. The system also appears to suffer from hallucination.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Consistently extracts relevant information from the input text.\n*   **Basic Logical Reasoning:** Capable of date comparisons, ordering, and other elementary logical operations.\n*   **Step-by-Step Solution Generation:** Able to break down the reasoning process into intermediate steps.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incomplete Reasoning Chains:** Fails to complete the final step in multi-step reasoning processes.\n*   **Lack of arithmetic reasoning**: Unable to perform even basic arithmetic reasoning\n*   **Hallucination**: Sometimes hallucinating information not in the original answer.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **completing reasoning chains**, specifically ensuring the system arrives at the final, explicit answer when all the necessary information has been extracted and processed.

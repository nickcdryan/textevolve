  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage approach with distinct LLM-driven agents to transform a grid based on training examples. It employs rule distillation by having a \"Rule Distiller\" extract candidate rules, a \"Rule Selector\" choose the best rule, and a \"Rule Applier\" apply it to the test input. The problem is decomposed into rule extraction, rule selection based on confidence and consistency, and rule application. Key functions include `main` orchestrating the process, `preprocess_question` extracting input, `distill_candidate_rules` generating rules, `select_best_rule` choosing the optimal rule, `apply_rule` transforming the grid, and `call_llm` interfacing with the Gemini model. The overall workflow involves preprocessing, rule distillation, rule selection, and rule application to generate the final transformed grid.",

This suggests that the code execution itself did not fail, but the reasoning and transformation logic was flawed.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Code Execution:** The system can execute code and generate a grid-like output, suggesting a basic understanding of grid manipulation.\n2.  **Pattern Recognition (Partial):** The system attempts to identify and replicate patterns from the training examples. It tries to reproduce the grid with some transformations.\n3. **Output Formatting:** The system is able to correctly output the result in the requested grid format, wrapped in the required ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END tags, even if the content of the grid is incorrect.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Pattern Generalization:** The system struggles to generalize from training examples to unseen test inputs. It fails to identify the underlying pattern logic.\n2.  **Contextual Awareness:** The system doesn't effectively integrate information about the position of elements within the grid and its effect on transformation rules. It treats elements in isolation.\n3.  **Constraint Handling:** The system does not accurately maintain the constraints established by the training data. The generated grids do not reflect the patterns present in the training set.\n4. **Lack of Intermediate Reasoning:** The process seems to lack intermediate reasoning steps that can be inspected.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Insufficient Pattern Understanding:** The system's primary bottleneck lies in its inability to deeply understand and abstract the complex transformation rules present in the training examples. It oversimplifies the patterns or applies them incorrectly.\n2.  **Weak Generalization:** The system struggles to extrapolate learned patterns to novel input grids, indicating a limited capacity for generalization and adaptation.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Value Assignment:** The system often assigns values to cells in the output grid that are not consistent with the patterns observed in the training examples.\n2.  **Lack of Positional Awareness:** The system's transformations are often independent of the cell's position within the grid.\n3. **Over-Simplification of Patterns:** The generated pattern is much simpler than that of the expected golden answer.\n4. **Reliance on \"Nearest Neighbors\" for Pattern:** It seems as if the solution repeats the numbers directly around the area near where '1' and other single-instance digits occur, but it does so poorly.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is a failure in the system's pattern recognition and generalization capabilities when dealing with grid transformation tasks. Specifically, the system struggles to understand *how* the transformation from input to output grids works in the training examples and then *apply* that understanding to the test input. The generated output often contains incorrect values due to misinterpreting the transformation logic. It seems to attempt a nearest-neighbor replication strategy which is fundamentally flawed.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition Enhancement:** Improve the system's ability to identify and extract complex patterns from the training examples.\n2.  **Positional Awareness Integration:** Incorporate positional awareness into the transformation logic, considering the location of cells and their relationships with other cells.\n3. **Generalization Ability:** Strengthen the system's ability to generalize from learned patterns to new and unseen input grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce Intermediate Reasoning Steps:** Implement intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly capture the identified pattern and transformation logic. This should involve extracting the type of transformation, the parameters for the transformation, and the location for the transformation. Add print statements for these intermediate reasoning steps to allow for debugging.\n2.  **Implement a more sophisticated pattern matching algorithm:** Implement an algorithm that extracts different objects in the grid and how they relate to each other. Pay attention to what triggers a transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\n3.  **Implement a more sophisticated replication strategy:** Consider each location and how it relates to the original grid, and the source of the replicated element.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID: 0**\n\n*   **Failed Capabilities:**\n    *   solution_generation\n    *   solution_verification\n    *   pattern_recognition\n\n**Sample ID: 1**\n\n*   **Failed Capabilities:**\n    *   solution_generation\n    *   solution_verification\n    *   pattern_recognition\n\n**Sample ID: 2**\n\n*   **Failed Capabilities:**\n    *   solution_generation\n    *   solution_verification\n    *   pattern_recognition\n    *   constraint_handling\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System for Grid Transformation\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe system consistently fails to produce correct output grids across all three provided samples. The outputs demonstrate a superficial attempt at replicating elements from the input or training data, but the applied logic is flawed, inconsistent, and does not reflect the true underlying pattern of the tasks. While the system correctly formats the output with the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags, the content within is incorrect. The output grids exhibit a lack of spatial understanding, failing to consider the relative positions of elements and their impact on transformations.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates rudimentary capabilities in code execution and output formatting, but exhibits significant shortcomings in pattern recognition, generalization, and constraint handling. Its performance is inadequate for complex grid transformation tasks. The system can be described as having *initial* capabilities in pattern replication (copying numbers).\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Code Execution:** Ability to execute code and generate grid-like outputs.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Correctly formats the output within the specified tags.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** Fails to generalize learned patterns to unseen test inputs.\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** Lacks effective integration of information about element positions.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Does not accurately maintain constraints established by training data.\n*   **Lack of Intermediate Reasoning:** The reasoning process is opaque and lacks inspectable steps.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. Without robust pattern recognition and generalization, the system cannot solve these types of problems.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Intermediate Reasoning Steps:** Add print statements to expose the model's thought process. Capture identified patterns, transformation logic, transformation parameters, and locations for transformations. For example:\n    *   `print(f\"Identified pattern: {pattern_type}\")`\n    *   `print(f\"Transformation parameter: {parameter_value}\")`\n    *   `print(f\"Applying transformation to location: {row}, {col}\")`\n\n2.  **Sophisticated Pattern Matching Algorithm:**\n    *   Develop an algorithm to extract objects and their relationships from the grid.\n    *   Identify triggers for transformations from input to output grids.\n    *   Consider feature engineering to represent patterns in a way that the model can understand. Example: Convolutional Neural Networks.\n    *   Consider utilizing outside tools to aid in Pattern Recognition (e.g., OpenCV)\n3.  **Sophisticated Replication Strategy:**\n    *   For each location, relate it to the original grid and identify the source of the replicated element.\n    *   Consider a knowledge graph for intermediate representation of the grid state and relations.\n    *   Move beyond nearest-neighbor approaches.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are present in the provided error cases based on the \"output\" fields. This suggests that the code execution itself did not fail, but the reasoning and transformation logic was flawed.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Code Execution:** The system can execute code and generate a grid-like output, suggesting a basic understanding of grid manipulation.\n2.  **Pattern Recognition (Partial):** The system attempts to identify and replicate patterns from the training examples. It tries to reproduce the grid with some transformations.\n3. **Output Formatting:** The system is able to correctly output the result in the requested grid format, wrapped in the required ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END tags, even if the content of the grid is incorrect.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Pattern Generalization:** The system struggles to generalize from training examples to unseen test inputs. It fails to identify the underlying pattern logic.\n2.  **Contextual Awareness:** The system doesn't effectively integrate information about the position of elements within the grid and its effect on transformation rules. It treats elements in isolation.\n3.  **Constraint Handling:** The system does not accurately maintain the constraints established by the training data. The generated grids do not reflect the patterns present in the training set.\n4. **Lack of Intermediate Reasoning:** The process seems to lack intermediate reasoning steps that can be inspected.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Insufficient Pattern Understanding:** The system's primary bottleneck lies in its inability to deeply understand and abstract the complex transformation rules present in the training examples. It oversimplifies the patterns or applies them incorrectly.\n2.  **Weak Generalization:** The system struggles to extrapolate learned patterns to novel input grids, indicating a limited capacity for generalization and adaptation.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Value Assignment:** The system often assigns values to cells in the output grid that are not consistent with the patterns observed in the training examples.\n2.  **Lack of Positional Awareness:** The system's transformations are often independent of the cell's position within the grid.\n3. **Over-Simplification of Patterns:** The generated pattern is much simpler than that of the expected golden answer.\n4. **Reliance on \"Nearest Neighbors\" for Pattern:** It seems as if the solution repeats the numbers directly around the area near where '1' and other single-instance digits occur, but it does so poorly.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is a failure in the system's pattern recognition and generalization capabilities when dealing with grid transformation tasks. Specifically, the system struggles to understand *how* the transformation from input to output grids works in the training examples and then *apply* that understanding to the test input. The generated output often contains incorrect values due to misinterpreting the transformation logic. It seems to attempt a nearest-neighbor replication strategy which is fundamentally flawed.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition Enhancement:** Improve the system's ability to identify and extract complex patterns from the training examples.\n2.  **Positional Awareness Integration:** Incorporate positional awareness into the transformation logic, considering the location of cells and their relationships with other cells.\n3. **Generalization Ability:** Strengthen the system's ability to generalize from learned patterns to new and unseen input grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce Intermediate Reasoning Steps:** Implement intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly capture the identified pattern and transformation logic. This should involve extracting the type of transformation, the parameters for the transformation, and the location for the transformation. Add print statements for these intermediate reasoning steps to allow for debugging.\n2.  **Implement a more sophisticated pattern matching algorithm:** Implement an algorithm that extracts different objects in the grid and how they relate to each other. Pay attention to what triggers a transformation from the input grid to the output grid.\n3.  **Implement a more sophisticated replication strategy:** Consider each location and how it relates to the original grid, and the source of the replicated element.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID: 0**\n\n*   **Failed Capabilities:**\n    *   solution_generation\n    *   solution_verification\n    *   pattern_recognition\n\n**Sample ID: 1**\n\n*   **Failed Capabilities:**\n    *   solution_generation\n    *   solution_verification\n    *   pattern_recognition\n\n**Sample ID: 2**\n\n*   **Failed Capabilities:**\n    *   solution_generation\n    *   solution_verification\n    *   pattern_recognition\n    *   constraint_handling\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System for Grid Transformation\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe system consistently fails to produce correct output grids across all three provided samples. The outputs demonstrate a superficial attempt at replicating elements from the input or training data, but the applied logic is flawed, inconsistent, and does not reflect the true underlying pattern of the tasks. While the system correctly formats the output with the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags, the content within is incorrect. The output grids exhibit a lack of spatial understanding, failing to consider the relative positions of elements and their impact on transformations.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates rudimentary capabilities in code execution and output formatting, but exhibits significant shortcomings in pattern recognition, generalization, and constraint handling. Its performance is inadequate for complex grid transformation tasks. The system can be described as having *initial* capabilities in pattern replication (copying numbers).\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Code Execution:** Ability to execute code and generate grid-like outputs.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Correctly formats the output within the specified tags.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** Fails to generalize learned patterns to unseen test inputs.\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** Lacks effective integration of information about element positions.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Does not accurately maintain constraints established by training data.\n*   **Lack of Intermediate Reasoning:** The reasoning process is opaque and lacks inspectable steps.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. Without robust pattern recognition and generalization, the system cannot solve these types of problems.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Intermediate Reasoning Steps:** Add print statements to expose the model's thought process. Capture identified patterns, transformation logic, transformation parameters, and locations for transformations. For example:\n    *   `print(f\"Identified pattern: {pattern_type}\")`\n    *   `print(f\"Transformation parameter: {parameter_value}\")`\n    *   `print(f\"Applying transformation to location: {row}, {col}\")`\n\n2.  **Sophisticated Pattern Matching Algorithm:**\n    *   Develop an algorithm to extract objects and their relationships from the grid.\n    *   Identify triggers for transformations from input to output grids.\n    *   Consider feature engineering to represent patterns in a way that the model can understand. Example: Convolutional Neural Networks.\n    *   Consider utilizing outside tools to aid in Pattern Recognition (e.g., OpenCV)\n3.  **Sophisticated Replication Strategy:**\n    *   For each location, relate it to the original grid and identify the source of the replicated element.\n    *   Consider a knowledge graph for intermediate representation of the grid state and relations.\n    *   Move beyond nearest-neighbor approaches. Instead, implement a method that considers global context and transformation rules.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable** at a very low level. There's no indication of improvement based on the current architecture and training methodology. Significant architectural and algorithmic changes are required to see improvement.\n"

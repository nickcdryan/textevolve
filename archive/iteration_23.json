  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to answer questions by simulating multiple search engines and reconciling their answers. The problem is decomposed into simulating search results, extracting answers from those results, reconciling the different answers into one, and validating the final answer. Several agent roles are defined: a search engine simulator, an answer extractor, an answer reconciler, and a validator.\n\nThe functions used are `call_llm`, `simulate_search`, `extract_answer`, `reconcile_answers`, `validate_answer`, and `main`. `simulate_search` uses `call_llm` to simulate search engine results, then `extract_answer` uses `call_llm` to get an answer from each search result. `reconcile_answers` then takes all the answers and the original question and uses `call_llm` to create one answer. Lastly, `validate_answer` validates the reconciled answer.\n\nThe overall workflow involves simulating searches with multiple engines using `simulate_search`, extracting answers from each search result with `extract_answer`, reconciling the extracted answers into a single answer using `reconcile_answers`, validating the final answer using `validate_answer`, and then returning the validated answer or an error message.",

It retrieves incorrect answers from its knowledge source or generates incorrect answers.\n*   There is no apparent mechanism for verifying the retrieved or generated answers against multiple sources to improve accuracy.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Factual accuracy**: The system's primary bottleneck is its inability to reliably retrieve and provide correct factual information. This overshadows other potential weaknesses.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Numerical Discrepancy:** All error cases involve a numerical discrepancy between the system's answer and the golden answer.

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\nHere's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and improvement suggestions.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs demonstrate a clear pattern: the system *attempts* to answer the questions but consistently provides *incorrect* answers. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are correctly implemented, indicating proper formatting. The outputs also reveal that the system includes units of measurement (e.g., \"meters\") when appropriate. However, the numerical values and the identified person's name are incorrect across all samples. This highlights a fundamental problem with fact retrieval or generation. The consistent inclusion of the unit \"meters\" suggests some understanding of the question, but the inaccuracy of the associated numerical value undermines its usefulness. The system does produce a response and does not error out.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a *limited* capability. It understands the basic question structure and can format its answers correctly, including identifying the type of information requested (e.g., a person's name, a depth in meters). However, its factual accuracy is currently non-existent, rendering the system effectively useless in its current state. The ability to format responses is a positive attribute, but accuracy is paramount.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Correct Answer Formatting:** The system correctly formats its answers with the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags and appropriate units of measurement.\n*   **Information Type Recognition:** The system recognizes the type of information requested (e.g., a person's name, depth) and attempts to provide a suitable answer.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Critical Factual Inaccuracy:** The system consistently provides incorrect factual information, rendering it unreliable. This is the *dominant* weakness.\n*   **Lack of Fact Verification:** There's no evidence of a mechanism to verify the accuracy of the retrieved or generated information.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **FACTUAL ACCURACY**. Without accuracy, all other strengths are irrelevant.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe following specific changes should be implemented in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Source Fact Verification Pipeline:**\n    *   **Modularize Answer Generation:** Break down the answer generation process into distinct modules: initial answer retrieval, fact verification, and final answer formatting.\n    *   **Query Multiple Sources:** After the initial answer retrieval, query *at least three* different, reputable knowledge sources (e.g., Wikipedia, Wikidata, DBpedia, a specialized database relevant to the domain) for the same information. Each source should be accessed via API calls for programmatic comparison.\n    *   **Confidence Scoring:** Assign a confidence score to each answer based on the source's reliability and the consistency of the information across sources. For example, if Wikipedia and Wikidata agree, but a less reputable source disagrees, the Wikipedia/Wikidata answer gets a higher confidence score.\n    *   **Disagreement Resolution:** Implement a strategy for resolving disagreements between sources. This could involve:\n        *   Selecting the answer with the highest confidence score.\n        *   Flagging the question for human review if the confidence scores are low or the disagreement is significant.\n        *   Implementing a \"reasoning\" module that attempts to reconcile the conflicting information.\n    *   **Prioritize open-source and well-documented knowledge sources to aid debugging.**\n2.  **Add Debugging Print Statements in the Fact Verification Pipeline:**\n    *   **Log Source Information:** Include print statements at each stage of the fact verification pipeline to log the source being queried, the answer retrieved from that source, and the assigned confidence score. For example:\n        ```python\n        source = \"Wikipedia\"\n        answer = get_answer_from_wikipedia(question)\n        confidence_score = calculate_wikipedia_confidence(answer)\n        print(f\"Source: {source}, Answer: {answer}, Confidence: {confidence_score}\")\n        ```\n    *   **Log Disagreements:** If there's a disagreement between sources, log the different answers and their corresponding confidence scores. This will help identify patterns in the errors and pinpoint which sources are unreliable.\n    *   **Log the selected answer, as well as the reason that this answer was selected.**\n3.  **Implement Numerical Range Validation:**\n    *   For questions requiring numerical answers, define reasonable ranges based on common-sense knowledge or domain-specific information.\n    *   Before returning an answer, validate that it falls within the defined range. If it doesn't, reject the answer and flag the question for review, indicating \"Out of Range Answer\" in the debug logs. For example, a negative depth of a lake is not physically possible.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **STABLE** at a very low level. The system consistently produces incorrect answers, indicating no improvement over time. The trend will only improve with the implementation of the recommendations above, and a significant evaluation of a wider dataset.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no runtime errors reported in the provided data. All errors are related to incorrect answers rather than system crashes.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   The system is able to identify the type of information required (e.g., a person's name, a depth in meters).\n*   The system is able to provide an answer in the requested format (e.g., including \"meters\" when necessary).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   The system struggles with factual accuracy. It retrieves incorrect answers from its knowledge source or generates incorrect answers.\n*   There is no apparent mechanism for verifying the retrieved or generated answers against multiple sources to improve accuracy.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Factual accuracy**: The system's primary bottleneck is its inability to reliably retrieve and provide correct factual information. This overshadows other potential weaknesses.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Numerical Discrepancy:** All error cases involve a numerical discrepancy between the system's answer and the golden answer. This highlights the sensitivity to factual errors in numerical data.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **lack of a robust fact-verification mechanism**. The system retrieves or generates an answer without sufficiently checking its accuracy against multiple reliable sources or applying reasonableness checks.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Fact Verification**: Implement a mechanism to verify the retrieved information against multiple sources. This could involve querying multiple knowledge bases or using a more sophisticated verification model.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning**: Improve the system's ability to handle numerical data. This could involve validating the numerical values against known ranges or using a dedicated numerical reasoning module.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Fact Verification Module**:\n    *   After generating an initial answer, query multiple knowledge sources (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia, a custom knowledge base) for the same information.\n    *   Score each source based on its reliability (e.g., based on the number of citations or the reputation of the source).\n    *   Compare the answers from different sources. If there is significant disagreement, flag the answer as potentially incorrect and try to find a more reliable answer.\n2.  **Add Numerical Range Checks**:\n    *   For questions involving numerical values, identify reasonable ranges for the answer. For example, the depth of a lake is unlikely to be more than a few hundred meters.\n    *   Reject answers that fall outside of these ranges and try to find a more reasonable answer.\n3. **Implement more print statements during retrieval and processing to identify the source and transformation of each answer.** This will enable better debugging of the factual answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0**:\n    *   information_extraction: Successful in extracting the required information.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate the correct solution due to knowledge retrieval issues.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the accuracy of the generated solution.\n*   **Sample ID 1**:\n    *   information_extraction: Successful in extracting the required information.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate the correct solution due to knowledge retrieval issues.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the accuracy of the generated solution.\n*   **Sample ID 2**:\n    *   information_extraction: Successful in extracting the required information.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate the correct solution due to knowledge retrieval issues.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the accuracy of the generated solution.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\nHere's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and improvement suggestions.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs demonstrate a clear pattern: the system *attempts* to answer the questions but consistently provides *incorrect* answers. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are correctly implemented, indicating proper formatting. The outputs also reveal that the system includes units of measurement (e.g., \"meters\") when appropriate. However, the numerical values and the identified person's name are incorrect across all samples. This highlights a fundamental problem with fact retrieval or generation. The consistent inclusion of the unit \"meters\" suggests some understanding of the question, but the inaccuracy of the associated numerical value undermines its usefulness. The system does produce a response and does not error out.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a *limited* capability. It understands the basic question structure and can format its answers correctly, including identifying the type of information requested (e.g., a person's name, a depth in meters). However, its factual accuracy is currently non-existent, rendering the system effectively useless in its current state. The ability to format responses is a positive attribute, but accuracy is paramount.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Correct Answer Formatting:** The system correctly formats its answers with the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags and appropriate units of measurement.\n*   **Information Type Recognition:** The system recognizes the type of information requested (e.g., a person's name, depth) and attempts to provide a suitable answer.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Critical Factual Inaccuracy:** The system consistently provides incorrect factual information, rendering it unreliable. This is the *dominant* weakness.\n*   **Lack of Fact Verification:** There's no evidence of a mechanism to verify the accuracy of the retrieved or generated information.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **FACTUAL ACCURACY**. Without accuracy, all other strengths are irrelevant.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe following specific changes should be implemented in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Source Fact Verification Pipeline:**\n    *   **Modularize Answer Generation:** Break down the answer generation process into distinct modules: initial answer retrieval, fact verification, and final answer formatting.\n    *   **Query Multiple Sources:** After the initial answer retrieval, query *at least three* different, reputable knowledge sources (e.g., Wikipedia, Wikidata, DBpedia, a specialized database relevant to the domain) for the same information. Each source should be accessed via API calls for programmatic comparison.\n    *   **Confidence Scoring:** Assign a confidence score to each answer based on the source's reliability and the consistency of the information across sources. For example, if Wikipedia and Wikidata agree, but a less reputable source disagrees, the Wikipedia/Wikidata answer gets a higher confidence score.\n    *   **Disagreement Resolution:** Implement a strategy for resolving disagreements between sources. This could involve:\n        *   Selecting the answer with the highest confidence score.\n        *   Flagging the question for human review if the confidence scores are low or the disagreement is significant.\n        *   Implementing a \"reasoning\" module that attempts to reconcile the conflicting information.\n    *   **Prioritize open-source and well-documented knowledge sources to aid debugging.**\n2.  **Add Debugging Print Statements in the Fact Verification Pipeline:**\n    *   **Log Source Information:** Include print statements at each stage of the fact verification pipeline to log the source being queried, the answer retrieved from that source, and the assigned confidence score. For example:\n        ```python\n        source = \"Wikipedia\"\n        answer = get_answer_from_wikipedia(question)\n        confidence_score = calculate_wikipedia_confidence(answer)\n        print(f\"Source: {source}, Answer: {answer}, Confidence: {confidence_score}\")\n        ```\n    *   **Log Disagreements:** If there's a disagreement between sources, log the different answers and their corresponding confidence scores. This will help identify patterns in the errors and pinpoint which sources are unreliable.\n    *   **Log the selected answer, as well as the reason that this answer was selected.**\n3.  **Implement Numerical Range Validation:**\n    *   For questions requiring numerical answers, define reasonable ranges based on common-sense knowledge or domain-specific information.\n    *   Before returning an answer, validate that it falls within the defined range. If it doesn't, reject the answer and flag the question for review, indicating \"Out of Range Answer\" in the debug logs. For example, a negative depth of a lake is not physically possible.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **STABLE** at a very low level. The system consistently produces incorrect answers, indicating no improvement over time. The trend will only improve with the implementation of the recommendations above, and a significant evaluation of a wider dataset.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script employs a meta-reasoning approach using LLMs to solve grid transformation problems. It decomposes the problem into meta-analysis, transformation application, and verification, assigning a distinct agent role to each. The `meta_analyze_patterns` function identifies transformation patterns, `apply_transformation` applies the identified pattern to the input, and `verify_transformation` checks the correctness of the transformation based on training examples. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow by extracting the input grid, calling the three functions sequentially, and returning the transformed grid if the verification is successful; otherwise, it returns an error.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no specific runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError explicitly mentioned in the provided data. However, the consistent \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" response indicates a logical error in the system's reasoning or pattern recognition rather than a technical runtime issue.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the data provided (only error cases), it's difficult to identify strengths. However, we can tentatively assume:\n\n1.  **Basic parsing:** The system can at least parse the input and training examples.\n2.  **Error Detection:** The system can detect when a transformation is likely incorrect, even if it cannot produce the correct transformation.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The system struggles to generalize from the training examples to the test input. It fails to correctly identify and apply the transformation pattern. The \"Transformation incorrect\" output suggests a failure to even produce a viable attempt at a transformation, not just an incorrect one.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning/Manipulation:** The task involves manipulating a grid of numbers according to a specific pattern. The system seems to lack the ability to perform this spatial reasoning correctly.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Pattern Extraction and Application:** The most critical bottleneck is the system's inability to accurately extract the underlying transformation pattern from the training examples and apply it to unseen inputs. This involves understanding the relationship between the input and output grids in the training set.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary recurring pattern is the \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" response. This suggests:\n\n1.  The system identifies a discrepancy between the test input and the patterns learned from the training examples, but cannot resolve this discrepancy.\n2.  The system lacks a robust mechanism for handling novel inputs that don't perfectly match the training data.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **insufficient pattern recognition and generalization ability.** The system is unable to deduce the rules governing the transformation between the input and output grids in the training examples and then apply those rules correctly to the test input.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's ability to identify and extract complex patterns from the training examples. This might involve techniques like convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, or other models designed for spatial reasoning.\n2.  **Robust Rule Inference:** Develop a mechanism for inferring transformation rules from the training data. This could involve using inductive logic programming or other techniques for automated reasoning.\n3.  **Better Generalization:** Implement strategies to improve the system's ability to generalize to unseen inputs. This could involve techniques like data augmentation or meta-learning.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Experiment with different model architectures:** Explore using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs) to better capture spatial relationships and patterns in the grids.\n2.  **Implement a rule-based system:** Complement the existing model with a rule-based system that can explicitly infer and apply transformation rules.\n3.  **Data augmentation:** Augment the training data by generating variations of the existing examples (e.g., rotations, reflections, translations).\n4.  **Introduce intermediate reasoning steps:** Add print statements or intermediate outputs within the system to track its reasoning process and identify where the errors occur. This might involve printing the inferred transformation rules or the intermediate state of the grid during the transformation.\n5.  **Implement a similarity metric:** Before attempting a transformation, calculate a similarity score between the test input and the training examples. If the similarity is below a threshold, the system could flag the input as \"unfamiliar\" and attempt a different approach (e.g., retrieving more training examples or simplifying the task).\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracted the grid, but failed to identify the core transformation logic).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (produced an incorrect output).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selected an incorrect solution).\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (correctly identified the transformation was incorrect, but could not find a correct one).\n    *   decision_making: Failed.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (correctly identified the transformation was incorrect, but could not find a correct one).\n    *   decision_making: Failed.\n",

While the system seems capable of basic output formatting (e.g., producing a JSON-like structure in one instance), the dominant pattern is the \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" response. This indicates:\n\n*   **Lack of Understanding:** The system doesn't understand the relationship between the input and output states in the training data.\n*   **Overfitting/Lack of Generalization:** The system may be too reliant on the specific examples in the training set and unable to generalize to new, unseen inputs. It's possible the system is detecting *differences* from the training data, but not able to *adapt* to those differences.\n*   **Potential Error Handling Issue:** While not a *runtime* error, the repeated error message suggests this might be a default fallback when the system fails to generate a plausible transformation.  It could be masking underlying problems. The system might be stopping too early in the process.\n*   **One potentially successful attempt:** Sample ID 0 yielded a grid, though there is no ground truth for this sample provided for comparison.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities in the specific task for which it was designed.  Its accuracy is essentially zero.  While it can parse inputs and potentially format outputs, it fails entirely at the core task of pattern recognition, rule inference, and grid transformation. **The system's primary capability is to identify when it is likely to fail.**\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Input Parsing:** The system can parse the input grids and the training examples (implied by its ability to compare them, leading to the \"Transformation incorrect\" message).\n*   **Basic Output Formatting:** In at least one case, the system attempted to output a grid in what appears to be a valid format, suggesting some basic ability to structure the output.\n*   **Error Detection (Partial):** The system can recognize when its proposed transformation is likely incorrect based on the training data, even if it cannot correct the transformation.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Generalization (Critical):** The core weakness is the inability to identify and apply the underlying transformation rules. This is the most critical issue.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning/Manipulation:** The system cannot perform the necessary spatial reasoning to manipulate the grids according to the transformation rules.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system is likely not considering or enforcing any explicit constraints related to the transformation process.\n*   **Lack of Rule Inference:** The system is failing to infer a generalizable rule from the training examples.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **pattern recognition and generalization**.  The system *must* be able to extract the rules governing the transformation from the training examples and apply them to unseen inputs.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Prioritize Model Architecture Experimentation:**\n    *   **Implement and test Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).** CNNs are designed to detect spatial patterns and are a strong candidate for this type of task.  Focus on architectures suitable for grid-like data.\n    *   **Consider Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).** If the relationships *between* the numbers in the grid are important (e.g., if the transformation depends on adjacency), GNNs could be beneficial.\n    *   **Evaluate Transformer architectures.** Transformers have shown strong performance in various sequence-to-sequence tasks. The grid transformation can be framed as converting an input grid \"sequence\" into an output grid \"sequence\".\n2.  **Implement and Integrate a Rule-Based Component:**\n    *   **Develop a rule engine:** Design a system that can represent and apply transformation rules.  This could be a separate module or integrated with the existing model.\n    *   **Focus on interpretability:** Ensure the rules are understandable and debuggable.\n3.  **Systematic Data Augmentation:**\n    *   **Generate diverse training examples:** Apply transformations like rotations, reflections, translations, and small random perturbations to the existing training data. This increases the robustness and generalizability of the model.\n    *   **Pay attention to label consistency:** Ensure that data augmentation does not change the transformation that should occur, if possible.\n4.  **Introduce and Analyze Intermediate Reasoning Steps (Crucial for Debugging):**\n    *   **Add logging/print statements:** Insert print statements to track the system's internal state at various points in the processing pipeline. This helps pinpoint exactly where the failure occurs.\n    *   **Visualize intermediate representations:** If possible, visualize the intermediate representations of the data within the model. This can provide insights into what the model is learning and where it is struggling.  For example, visualize feature maps in a CNN.\n    *   **Log the inferred rules:** If a rule-based component is implemented, log the rules that the system infers from the training data.\n5.  **Implement a Similarity Metric for Input Validation:**\n    *   **Calculate similarity scores:** Before attempting a transformation, calculate a similarity score between the test input and the training examples.\n    *   **Set a threshold:** If the similarity is below a certain threshold, flag the input as \"unfamiliar\" and trigger a different processing path (e.g., retrieve more similar training examples or attempt a simplified transformation). This allows the system to handle novel inputs more gracefully.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current data, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level.** The system consistently fails, indicating a lack of progress. Without significant changes in the approach (as outlined in the recommendations above), the trend is likely to remain stagnant. Once the recommendations are implemented, monitor the trend to ensure that changes yield positive results.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no specific runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError explicitly mentioned in the provided data. However, the consistent \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" response indicates a logical error in the system's reasoning or pattern recognition rather than a technical runtime issue.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the data provided (only error cases), it's difficult to identify strengths. However, we can tentatively assume:\n\n1.  **Basic parsing:** The system can at least parse the input and training examples.\n2.  **Error Detection:** The system can detect when a transformation is likely incorrect, even if it cannot produce the correct transformation.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The system struggles to generalize from the training examples to the test input. It fails to correctly identify and apply the transformation pattern. The \"Transformation incorrect\" output suggests a failure to even produce a viable attempt at a transformation, not just an incorrect one.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning/Manipulation:** The task involves manipulating a grid of numbers according to a specific pattern. The system seems to lack the ability to perform this spatial reasoning correctly.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Pattern Extraction and Application:** The most critical bottleneck is the system's inability to accurately extract the underlying transformation pattern from the training examples and apply it to unseen inputs. This involves understanding the relationship between the input and output grids in the training set.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary recurring pattern is the \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" response. This suggests:\n\n1.  The system identifies a discrepancy between the test input and the patterns learned from the training examples, but cannot resolve this discrepancy.\n2.  The system lacks a robust mechanism for handling novel inputs that don't perfectly match the training data.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **insufficient pattern recognition and generalization ability.** The system is unable to deduce the rules governing the transformation between the input and output grids in the training examples and then apply those rules correctly to the test input.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's ability to identify and extract complex patterns from the training examples. This might involve techniques like convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, or other models designed for spatial reasoning.\n2.  **Robust Rule Inference:** Develop a mechanism for inferring transformation rules from the training data. This could involve using inductive logic programming or other techniques for automated reasoning.\n3.  **Better Generalization:** Implement strategies to improve the system's ability to generalize to unseen inputs. This could involve techniques like data augmentation or meta-learning.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Experiment with different model architectures:** Explore using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs) to better capture spatial relationships and patterns in the grids.\n2.  **Implement a rule-based system:** Complement the existing model with a rule-based system that can explicitly infer and apply transformation rules.\n3.  **Data augmentation:** Augment the training data by generating variations of the existing examples (e.g., rotations, reflections, translations).\n4.  **Introduce intermediate reasoning steps:** Add print statements or intermediate outputs within the system to track its reasoning process and identify where the errors occur. This might involve printing the inferred transformation rules or the intermediate state of the grid during the transformation.\n5.  **Implement a similarity metric:** Before attempting a transformation, calculate a similarity score between the test input and the training examples. If the similarity is below a threshold, the system could flag the input as \"unfamiliar\" and attempt a different approach (e.g., retrieving more training examples or simplifying the task).\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracted the grid, but failed to identify the core transformation logic).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (produced an incorrect output).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selected an incorrect solution).\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (correctly identified the transformation was incorrect, but could not find a correct one).\n    *   decision_making: Failed.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (correctly identified the transformation was incorrect, but could not find a correct one).\n    *   decision_making: Failed.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided data.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a critical failure in the system's ability to perform the intended transformation.  While the system seems capable of basic output formatting (e.g., producing a JSON-like structure in one instance), the dominant pattern is the \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" response. This indicates:\n\n*   **Lack of Understanding:** The system doesn't understand the relationship between the input and output states in the training data.\n*   **Overfitting/Lack of Generalization:** The system may be too reliant on the specific examples in the training set and unable to generalize to new, unseen inputs. It's possible the system is detecting *differences* from the training data, but not able to *adapt* to those differences.\n*   **Potential Error Handling Issue:** While not a *runtime* error, the repeated error message suggests this might be a default fallback when the system fails to generate a plausible transformation.  It could be masking underlying problems. The system might be stopping too early in the process.\n*   **One potentially successful attempt:** Sample ID 0 yielded a grid, though there is no ground truth for this sample provided for comparison.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities in the specific task for which it was designed.  Its accuracy is essentially zero.  While it can parse inputs and potentially format outputs, it fails entirely at the core task of pattern recognition, rule inference, and grid transformation. **The system's primary capability is to identify when it is likely to fail.**\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Input Parsing:** The system can parse the input grids and the training examples (implied by its ability to compare them, leading to the \"Transformation incorrect\" message).\n*   **Basic Output Formatting:** In at least one case, the system attempted to output a grid in what appears to be a valid format, suggesting some basic ability to structure the output.\n*   **Error Detection (Partial):** The system can recognize when its proposed transformation is likely incorrect based on the training data, even if it cannot correct the transformation.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Generalization (Critical):** The core weakness is the inability to identify and apply the underlying transformation rules. This is the most critical issue.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning/Manipulation:** The system cannot perform the necessary spatial reasoning to manipulate the grids according to the transformation rules.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system is likely not considering or enforcing any explicit constraints related to the transformation process.\n*   **Lack of Rule Inference:** The system is failing to infer a generalizable rule from the training examples.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **pattern recognition and generalization**.

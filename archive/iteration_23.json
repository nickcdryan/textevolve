  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using an LLM-driven approach with specialized agents for extraction and scheduling. The `extract_meeting_info` function extracts the meeting details, and the `schedule_meeting` function proposes a time, both using multi-example prompting and a validation step. The `call_llm` function interfaces with the Gemini API for LLM calls using a system instruction if provided in the function parameters. The overall workflow involves extracting meeting details, scheduling the meeting, and then returning the proposed time, with multiple validation steps and error handling.",

It can process input, identify time constraints, and attempt to reason about availability. However, it struggles with accuracy, consistent reasoning, and proper decision-making, especially concerning preferences. The system's reasoning and logic is in need of substantial improvement.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The ability to identify participant schedules and time preferences from the problem statement is a valuable foundation.\n*   **General Reasoning Process:** The overall structure of iterating through days and identifying free slots provides a good starting point.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Decision-Making Logic:** This is the *most* critical weakness.

Without accurate and reliable decision-making, the system cannot function effectively as a scheduler.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the performance summary, error analysis, and execution analysis, here are actionable recommendations for the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Scoring Mechanism:**\n    *   Develop a robust scoring function that assigns points to each potential time slot based on:\n        *   **Hard Constraint Satisfaction:** (e.g., +10 points for each participant available).\n        *   **Preference Satisfaction:** (e.g., +5 points if the time aligns with a participant's preferred day, -3 points if it violates a preference).\n    *   The final decision should *always* be based on the time slot with the highest score.\n\n2.  **Introduce Specialized Verification/Scoring Agent:**\n    *   Create a new agent specifically responsible for validating potential solutions and scoring them according to the scoring mechanism.  This will decouple the reasoning and solution generation from the final decision.\n    *   The verification agent should *explicitly* state whether each hard and soft constraint is satisfied for a given time slot.\n\n3.  **Revise Few-Shot Examples with Explicit Scoring:**\n    *   The few-shot examples should demonstrate the scoring mechanism in action.\n    *   Show *multiple* candidate time slots with different scores based on hard and soft constraint satisfaction.\n    *   The examples should *explicitly explain* why the highest-scoring time slot is chosen.\n\n4.  **Refine Preference Incorporation in Prompts:**\n    *   In the main prompt and specialized agent's prompt, add clear instructions that preferences are *secondary* to hard constraints.\n    *   Emphasize that no time slot should be considered if it violates a hard constraint, regardless of how well it aligns with preferences.\n\n5.  **Implement Explicit Constraint Satisfaction Check:**\n    *   In the specialized agent's workflow, include a step where it *explicitly states* whether the selected time slot satisfies all hard constraints. If any hard constraint is violated, the agent must reject the solution.\n\n6. **Increase the diversity of few-shot examples:**\n    * The system struggles to correctly incorporate soft constraints or preferences expressed by participants. The few shot examples should include a wider range of soft contraints, and explicitly demonstrate how they should be handled\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy of 0.70 and the clear weaknesses in decision-making, the capability trend is currently **stable but fragile.** Without significant improvements in the decision-making process, the system's capabilities will remain limited.

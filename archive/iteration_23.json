  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM-driven approach involving rule extraction, verification, and application. It decomposes the problem into three main steps: extracting the transformation rule from examples, verifying the extracted rule's consistency, and applying the rule to the test input. The `solve_grid_transformation` function acts as the agent, orchestrating these steps with the help of `call_llm`. `call_llm` interacts with the Gemini API. The workflow is as follows: `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which uses `call_llm` to get the extracted rule. `solve_grid_transformation` then uses `call_llm` to verify the rule, and, if verified, `call_llm` is used a final time to apply the verified rule to the test case.",

The errors stem from logical inconsistencies in the generated solutions compared to the expected output.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n- The system correctly identifies that some elements within the grid should be transformed based on the training examples.\n- The system's code generation and execution capabilities work without producing syntax errors or runtime exceptions.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n- **Pattern Generalization:** The system fails to generalize complex grid transformation patterns beyond the immediate training examples. It struggles to identify the underlying logic and apply it accurately to unseen input grids.\n- **Dimensionality and Shape Handling:** The system seems to have issues with inferring the expected output grid dimensions based on the training examples. It struggles to match input and output dimensions correctly.\n- **Value Mapping and Feature Extraction**: The system struggles with accurately mapping input values to output values and also struggles to extract specific features needed to do the correct mappings.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Pattern Generalization and Feature Extraction:** The system struggles to extrapolate complex patterns from a limited set of examples. It needs to be able to extract abstract transformation rules. This is the single most critical bottleneck.\n- **Dimensionality Inference:** The system fails to correctly infer output grid dimensions, leading to fundamentally incorrect solutions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- **Incorrect Dimensions:** The generated output grids often have different dimensions than the expected output, indicating a failure to understand the relationship between input and output grid sizes.\n- **Inaccurate Transformations:** Even when the dimensions are somewhat correct, the actual transformations applied to the grid elements are often incorrect, suggesting a misunderstanding of the underlying rules.\n- **Local Reasoning:** The system focuses on local patterns in the input grid and fails to incorporate global context or long-range dependencies, resulting in inconsistent transformations.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to generalize abstract grid transformation rules from the training examples to new input grids.

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\nHere's a comprehensive capability assessment report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and improvement suggestions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several key issues:\n\n*   **Dimensionality Mismatch:** The output grids frequently have dimensions significantly different from what the task requires. For example, in the first sample, the output grid's dimensions are completely arbitrary and seem unrelated to any input grid. The third sample has extraneous columns (and rows).\n*   **Value Mapping Errors:** The generated grids exhibit incorrect transformations of input values. Sample 3 shows a consistent replacement of values with 3 and 7 which may not be accurate or follow the correct mapping.\n*   **Inconsistent Pattern Application:** Patterns, if any, are applied inconsistently. The first example has numbers scattered around the grid without apparent logic. The second example has too many 2's with only very few of the other required values.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system's current capabilities are significantly limited. While it demonstrates basic code execution without runtime errors and can identify the need for grid transformations, it severely lacks the ability to:\n\n*   **Generalize patterns:** It cannot extrapolate transformation rules from training examples.\n*   **Infer dimensionality:** Fails to understand the relationship between input and output grid sizes.\n*   **Perform Accurate Value Mapping:** Struggles to correctly map input values to output values.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Appears incapable of verifying if a solution is correct according to the task's requirements.\n\nOverall, the system operates at a very basic level, falling short of the core requirements for this task. Its low accuracy (33%) reflects these limitations.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Execution Stability:** The system generates and executes code without syntax or runtime errors. This indicates a stable coding and execution environment.\n*   **Transformation Recognition:** The system can identify the need for transforming input grids based on provided training examples. This demonstrates some understanding of the task's fundamental requirement.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The inability to generalize complex patterns from limited examples is a critical weakness. The system needs to extract and apply abstract transformation rules.\n*   **Dimensionality Inference:** The failure to correctly infer output grid dimensions is a fundamental flaw.\n*   **Inaccurate Transformations:** Even when the dimensions are somewhat correct, the actual transformations applied to the grid elements are often incorrect.\n*   **Lack of Relational Understanding:** The system appears to operate on individual cell values without understanding their relationship to other cells or overall patterns.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization.** Addressing this will have the most significant impact on overall performance.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo improve the system's capabilities, implement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Dimensionality Analysis:** Before attempting any transformation, add a preprocessing step to analyze the training examples and establish the relationship between input and output grid dimensions. This analysis should output a function or set of rules that predict the output grid dimensions given an input grid.\n2.  **Integrate a Pattern Recognition Module:** Incorporate a pattern recognition module, potentially based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), tailored for grid-based data. This module should be trained to identify and extract transformation patterns from the training examples.  Ensure that the training process includes negative examples (situations where no transformation should occur) to improve robustness.\n3.  **Introduce Relational Reasoning:** Augment the system with a module that explicitly reasons about the relationships between values in the grid. This could involve calculating statistics (e.g., average, median, mode) of neighboring cells or identifying repeating patterns within the grid.\n4.  **Implement Transformation Rule Representation:** The system needs a structured way to represent the transformation rules it learns. This could involve a symbolic representation, a set of mathematical equations, or a neural network specifically designed to encode transformation rules.\n5.  **Develop a Loss Function that Penalizes Dimensionality Errors:** The training process should include a loss function that heavily penalizes errors in output grid dimensions. This will force the system to prioritize correct dimensionality.\n6.  **Implement a Solution Verification Module:** Before outputting a final answer, the system should run a series of checks to verify the solution against the training examples. This could involve comparing the generated output to the expected output for a small subset of the training data.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are **stable but inadequate**. Without significant architectural changes, the system is unlikely to improve significantly. The current approach appears fundamentally limited in its ability to solve these types of problems.\n",

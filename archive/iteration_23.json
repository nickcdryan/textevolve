  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by first analyzing visual features using an LLM and then applying the described transformation. The problem is decomposed into `analyze_visual_features` (identifies the transformation) and `apply_transformation` (applies the transformation to a test grid). The agent roles include an expert at analyzing visual features and an expert at applying transformations. Other functions used include `call_llm` to interface with the Gemini API and `main` to orchestrate the overall process.\n\nThe workflow is as follows: `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which calls `analyze_visual_features` to get a transformation description (verified by the LLM), and then calls `apply_transformation` to generate the final output grid. `call_llm` is used by both `analyze_visual_features` and `apply_transformation` to interact with the Gemini model.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nAll three error cases exhibit the same runtime error: \"Error: Output grid is not in the correct format (list of lists).\" This indicates a fundamental failure in the output generation process. The system fails to structure the output as a nested list, which is the expected format for a grid. This suggests a problem in the final formatting stage of the solution.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the information available (only error cases), it's difficult to pinpoint specific strengths. However, the system seems to be able to:\n\n1.  Understand the problem description and identify that a grid transformation is required.\n2.  Attempt to apply a pattern based on training examples.\n3.  Recognize that it should output a list of lists, even though it ultimately fails to do so.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Output Formatting Failure:** The system consistently fails to format the output as a list of lists. This is a critical flaw that prevents any correct solutions.\n2.  **Pattern Identification:** While the system attempts to apply a pattern, the error message gives no insight into whether it is extracting and applying the correct pattern.\n3. **Lack of Error Handling for Pattern Extraction Failure:** The system simply returns the format error, instead of attempting to identify a pattern and gracefully failing (or indicating a pattern could not be identified) before getting to the formatting stage.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting:** The most critical bottleneck is the failure to generate the output in the correct list-of-lists format. This renders any other reasoning steps useless.\n2.  **Pattern Generalization and Application:** The system seems unable to extract and generalize the complex patterns present in the training examples and accurately apply them to the test input. This means the \"transformation\" part of the grid transformation is missing or broken.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent \"Output grid is not in the correct format (list of lists)\" error message across all three samples suggests a systematic problem in the part of the code responsible for structuring the output. It's not an intermittent bug, but a consistent failure.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **incorrect output formatting**. The system does not produce a nested list (list of lists) as required for the grid output. This could be due to a Type error. It may be worth investigating if it is coercing the structure into the wrong format.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting:** Implement a robust mechanism to ensure the output is always a list of lists. This might involve a dedicated function for grid formatting, with explicit type checking.\n2.  **Pattern Identification and Application:** Improve the system's ability to identify and apply patterns from the training examples. This could involve more sophisticated feature extraction, pattern matching, or rule generation techniques.\n3.  **Debugging and Logging:** Add more logging to trace the system's reasoning path, especially for the pattern identification and application steps. This will help pinpoint where the reasoning goes wrong.\n4.  **Error Handling:** Implement more graceful error handling. For example, if no pattern can be identified, the system should return a specific message indicating this, rather than simply failing during output formatting.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Dedicated Output Formatting Function:** Create a separate function specifically for formatting the output grid as a list of lists. This function should take the transformed grid data as input and return a properly formatted string representation. This function should include an \"assert\" statement to check that the structure is correct *before* it is output.\n2.  **Debugging with Print Statements:** Insert print statements at key points in the code, especially around the output formatting section, to inspect the data structure being generated.\n3.  **Example-Based Pattern Learning:** Refine the pattern learning algorithm to handle more complex transformations. Consider techniques like sequence alignment or graph matching to identify corresponding elements in the input and output grids.\n4.  **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling to catch potential errors during pattern extraction and application. Log these errors with descriptive messages to aid in debugging.\n5.  **Implement Check Functions:** Add check functions for important data structures, such as checking if a grid is valid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation logic)\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   constraint_handling: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   decision_making: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation logic)\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   constraint_handling: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   decision_making: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation logic)\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   constraint_handling: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   decision_making: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your previous analysis.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs show a consistent and critical error: \"Error: Output grid is not in the correct format (list of lists).\"  This error appears in every attempt (all three samples), indicating a systematic problem, not a random or intermittent one. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest the system is attempting to structure its response, but the core grid formation logic is failing.  The fact that the same error occurs consistently suggests the error handling *is* working to some degree by catching the formatting issue, but the root cause needs to be addressed.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the system has minimal demonstrable capabilities. While it appears to understand the problem requires generating a grid and attempts to apply a transformation, its inability to format the output correctly renders these attempts useless.  The system is effectively non-functional in its current state. The `solution_generation` is failing on all samples.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Understanding:** The system understands the task and attempts to generate a grid structure, even if it fails to format it correctly.\n*   **Basic Error Handling:** The system can at least detect and report the output formatting error, preventing it from returning completely nonsensical results.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Critical Output Formatting Failure:** The system cannot produce the required list-of-lists output format, which is essential for this task.\n*   **Pattern Generalization/Application (Suspected):** While not explicitly proven by the error message, it's highly likely the pattern extraction and application logic is either flawed or not robust enough to handle the complexity of the transformations. The output error occurs after the transformation is attempted, suggesting the problem lies there.\n*   **Lack of Specific Error Information:** The error message is generic. It doesn't provide clues about why the output is incorrectly formatted.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **robust output formatting.** Without a correctly formatted output, the system cannot succeed, regardless of its pattern recognition abilities.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThese recommendations are prioritized to address the immediate output formatting issue and then move on to improving pattern recognition and error handling.\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Output Formatting Function with Strict Type Checking (CRITICAL):**\n\n    *   Create a function named something like `format_grid_output(grid_data)`.\n    *   Inside this function:\n        *   **Add Type Assertions:** *Before* doing any formatting, use `assert isinstance(grid_data, list), \"Input must be a list\"` and `assert all(isinstance(row, list) for row in grid_data), \"Each element must be a list\"`.  This will immediately flag if the input data to the formatting function isn't a list of lists. If the assertion fails, this gives a more descriptive error than the current message.\n        *   **Explicitly Construct the Output:** Use nested loops or list comprehensions to *explicitly* build the output list of lists.  Avoid relying on implicit conversions or potentially buggy built-in functions.\n        *   **Return the Formatted Grid:**  Ensure the function *returns* the formatted `grid_data` (which is now verified as a list of lists).\n2.  **Debug with Granular Print Statements and logging (CRITICAL):**\n\n    *   Add `print()` statements *inside* the `format_grid_output` function to inspect the `grid_data` variable's value and type *before* and *after* formatting. This will help you see exactly what the formatting function is receiving and what it's producing.\n    *   Add `logging` statements before and after the call to `format_grid_output` to capture the state of the system before and after it attempts to call the formatting function.\n    *   Add logging statements in the `Pattern Identification` and `Application` to see the inputs and outputs of those steps.\n\n3.  **Isolate Output Formatting in Testing (CRITICAL):**\n\n    *   Create unit tests specifically for the `format_grid_output` function.  These tests should cover various edge cases: empty grids, grids with different dimensions, grids with different data types in the cells (if applicable), and potentially invalid input types to confirm the assertions are working.\n4. **Review the Entire Formatting Section for Type Errors.** Ensure that there is not a Type Error being created in that section of the code. You may want to consider using `mypy` and adding type hints to identify these errors.\n\n5.  **After resolving the output formatting issue, begin the next step.** Focus on refining the pattern learning algorithm to handle more complex transformations.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **stable, but critically low**. The system consistently fails with the same error, indicating no progress. Once the output formatting issue is addressed, we can better assess the pattern recognition and application capabilities.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nAll three error cases exhibit the same runtime error: \"Error: Output grid is not in the correct format (list of lists).\" This indicates a fundamental failure in the output generation process. The system fails to structure the output as a nested list, which is the expected format for a grid. This suggests a problem in the final formatting stage of the solution.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the information available (only error cases), it's difficult to pinpoint specific strengths. However, the system seems to be able to:\n\n1.  Understand the problem description and identify that a grid transformation is required.\n2.  Attempt to apply a pattern based on training examples.\n3.  Recognize that it should output a list of lists, even though it ultimately fails to do so.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Output Formatting Failure:** The system consistently fails to format the output as a list of lists. This is a critical flaw that prevents any correct solutions.\n2.  **Pattern Identification:** While the system attempts to apply a pattern, the error message gives no insight into whether it is extracting and applying the correct pattern.\n3. **Lack of Error Handling for Pattern Extraction Failure:** The system simply returns the format error, instead of attempting to identify a pattern and gracefully failing (or indicating a pattern could not be identified) before getting to the formatting stage.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting:** The most critical bottleneck is the failure to generate the output in the correct list-of-lists format. This renders any other reasoning steps useless.\n2.  **Pattern Generalization and Application:** The system seems unable to extract and generalize the complex patterns present in the training examples and accurately apply them to the test input. This means the \"transformation\" part of the grid transformation is missing or broken.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent \"Output grid is not in the correct format (list of lists)\" error message across all three samples suggests a systematic problem in the part of the code responsible for structuring the output. It's not an intermittent bug, but a consistent failure.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **incorrect output formatting**. The system does not produce a nested list (list of lists) as required for the grid output. This could be due to a Type error. It may be worth investigating if it is coercing the structure into the wrong format.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting:** Implement a robust mechanism to ensure the output is always a list of lists. This might involve a dedicated function for grid formatting, with explicit type checking.\n2.  **Pattern Identification and Application:** Improve the system's ability to identify and apply patterns from the training examples. This could involve more sophisticated feature extraction, pattern matching, or rule generation techniques.\n3.  **Debugging and Logging:** Add more logging to trace the system's reasoning path, especially for the pattern identification and application steps. This will help pinpoint where the reasoning goes wrong.\n4.  **Error Handling:** Implement more graceful error handling. For example, if no pattern can be identified, the system should return a specific message indicating this, rather than simply failing during output formatting.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Dedicated Output Formatting Function:** Create a separate function specifically for formatting the output grid as a list of lists. This function should take the transformed grid data as input and return a properly formatted string representation. This function should include an \"assert\" statement to check that the structure is correct *before* it is output.\n2.  **Debugging with Print Statements:** Insert print statements at key points in the code, especially around the output formatting section, to inspect the data structure being generated.\n3.  **Example-Based Pattern Learning:** Refine the pattern learning algorithm to handle more complex transformations. Consider techniques like sequence alignment or graph matching to identify corresponding elements in the input and output grids.\n4.  **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling to catch potential errors during pattern extraction and application. Log these errors with descriptive messages to aid in debugging.\n5.  **Implement Check Functions:** Add check functions for important data structures, such as checking if a grid is valid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation logic)\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   constraint_handling: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   decision_making: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation logic)\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   constraint_handling: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   decision_making: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation logic)\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   constraint_handling: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n    *   decision_making: N/A (failed to generate a solution)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your previous analysis.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs show a consistent and critical error: \"Error: Output grid is not in the correct format (list of lists).\"  This error appears in every attempt (all three samples), indicating a systematic problem, not a random or intermittent one. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest the system is attempting to structure its response, but the core grid formation logic is failing.

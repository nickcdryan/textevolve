The peasant army was governed by a so-called ring, in which peasants gathered in a circle to debate tactics, troop movements, alliances, and the distribution of spoils. The ring was the decision-making body. In addition to this democratic construct, each band had a hierarchy of leaders including a supreme commander and a marshal , who maintained law and order. Other roles included lieutenants, captains, standard-bearers, master gunner, wagon-fort master, train master, four watch-masters, four sergeant-majors to arrange the order of battle, a weibel  for each company, two quartermasters, farriers, quartermasters for the horses, a communications officer and a pillage master.\n\nQUESTION: How many more Alsatian peasants who took the field at the Battle of Zabern were there compared to the peasant force at Frankenhausen?\n    Answer: 10,000\n\n    Passage: The Alsatian peasants who took to the field at the Battle of Zabern numbered 18,000. others, such as the peasant force at Frankenhausen, could gather 8,000.\n\n    Analysis: ```json\n{\"type\": \"comparison\", \"keywords\": [\"Alsatian peasants\", \"Battle of Zabern\", \"peasant force\", \"Frankenhausen\"], \"calculation_needed\": \"yes\"}\n```\n    Verification:\n    ", "system_instruction": "Expert at verifying answers and performing calculations if needed."}, "output": "10,000\n", "status": "success"}

Singapore became one of the entry and dispersal points for large number of Chinese and Indian migrants who came to work in the plantations and mines of the Straits Settlements, many of whom then settled in Singapore after their contract ended. By 1860, the total population had reached around 90,000, of these 50,000 were Chinese, and 2,445 Europeans and Eurasians. The first thorough census in Singapore was undertaken in 1871, and the people were grouped into 33 racial, ethnic or national categories, with Chinese forming the largest group at 57.6%. Censuses were then conducted at 10 year intervals afterwards. The 1881 census grouped the people into 6 main categories, and further subdivided into 47 sub-categories. The 6 broad groups were given as Europeans, Eurasians, Malays, Chinese, Indians and Others in 1921. The Malays group includes other natives of the Malay archipelago, the Europeans include Americans, the Indians would be people from the Indian subcontinent including what would now be Pakistan and Bangladesh. In 1901, the total population of Singapore was 228,555, with 15.8% Malays, 71.8% Chinese, 7.8% Indians, and 3.5% Europeans and Eurasians. The Chinese population figure of Singapore has stayed at over 70% of the total since, reaching 77.8% in 1947. After dropping from a peak of 60% in the early years of Singapore, the Malay population would range between 11 and 16% in the first half of the 20th century, while Indians hovered between 7 and just over 9% in the same period.\n\nQUESTION: How many percent were not Malays in the early years?\n    Answer: 60% were Malays in the early years.

Going into the fourth with Houston leading 20-10, the Texans continued to run, and the Colts continued to pass, as Peyton Manning attempted 57 passes that day, completing 40, a career-high. However, it wouldn't be enough; even though the Colts scored two touchdowns on a 10-yard pass to Dallas Clark and a 73-yard pass to Austin Collie, the Texans would score two of their own: 25 and 8-yard runs from Arian Foster en route to a 34-24 Houston win at Reliant Stadium. Arian Foster finished with 231 rushing yards on 33 carries. Both were Houston records for a game, and the 231 yards was the second most rushing yards on opening week, only behind O.J. Simpson. Peyton Manning eventually went 40/57 for 433 yards and three touchdowns. Houston began the season 1-0 and won for only the second time against Indianapolis, against fifteen losses.

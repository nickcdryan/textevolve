  "approach_summary": "The script implements a knowledge retrieval and answer generation approach using an LLM in two steps. First, the `call_llm` function is used with the LLM to generate a search query based on the input question. The `perform_search` function simulates a web search using the generated query. Finally, the `call_llm` function is again used with the LLM to synthesize the search results with the original question to generate a final answer. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow by calling the `call_llm` function twice, once for query generation and once for answer synthesis, and `perform_search` to simulate searching.",

The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The opening day of the offensive  was the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000.

      "question": "PASSAGE: War crimes were committed by both sides during the Macedonian struggle. According to a 1900 British report compiled by Alfred Biliotti, who is considered to have heavily relied on Greek intelligence agents, starting from 1897, the members of the Exarchist committees had embarked upon a systematic and extensive campaign of executions of the leading members of the Greek side. Moreover, Bulgarian Komitadjis, pursued a campaign of extermination of Greek and Serbian teachers and clergy. On the other hand, there were attacks by Greek Andartes on many Macedonian Bulgarian villages, with the aim of forcing their inhabitants to switch their allegiance from the Exarchate back to the Patriarchate and accept Greek priest and teachers, but they also carried out massacres against the civilian population, especially in the central parts of Macedonia in 1905 and in 1906. One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani , which was an aggressive pro-Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands. According to British reports on political crimes , during the period from 1897 to 1912 over 4000 political murders were committed , excluding those killed during the Ilinden uprising and the members of the Bulgarian and Greek bands. Of those who were killed, 53% were Bulgarians, 33.5% were Greeks, Serbs and Aromanians together 3.5% and 10% were of an unknown nationality.

One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani , which was an aggressive pro-Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands. According to British reports on political crimes , during the period from 1897 to 1912 over 4000 political murders were committed , excluding those killed during the Ilinden uprising and the members of the Bulgarian and Greek bands. Of those who were killed, 53% were Bulgarians, 33.5% were Greeks, Serbs and Aromanians together 3.5% and 10% were of an unknown nationality. These conflicts ended after the revolution of Young Turks in July 1908, as they promised to respect all ethnicities and religions, and to provide a constitution.",

The Bills would get on the board with a 35-yard field goal from kicker Rian Lindell, but Miami would answer with running back Ronnie Brown's 1-yard touchdown run. The Dolphins' domination continued into the third quarter with quarterback Chad Henne completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brian Hartline, followed by a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Ricky Williams.

This is good for parsing and extracting the actual answer. However, the model sometimes includes extraneous information *within* the answer tags (e.g., explaining the calculation process). While this *could* be useful for debugging, it might hinder automated evaluation or use in a system where only the final answer is needed.\n*   **Correct Answer in Success Case:** The second sample execution contains a successful response and correctly calculates \"125\" years. The calculation explanation might be more concise.\n*   **Error Analysis in Execution:** The third sample provides an erroneous response, the model provides all of the point information and fails to extract the correct difference between the points. The analysis reveals that the model knows the points scored, but fails to extract the correct answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of information extraction and simple calculations, but its reasoning and contextual understanding are weak. It can identify relevant facts but struggles to apply them correctly to answer specific questions. The system shows a vulnerability to misinterpreting numerical questions. Overall, the system is functioning at a beginner level.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system is generally able to extract relevant pieces of information from the input text.\n*   **Basic Calculation:** Performs simple arithmetic operations correctly in some cases.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Precise Reasoning:** Struggles to interpret questions correctly and perform precise, focused reasoning. The biggest weakness to address.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Lacks deep understanding of the question's context, leading to irrelevant details or incorrect assumptions.\n*   **Question Interpretation:** Frequently misinterprets the exact requirement of the question.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Fails to identify and adhere to constraints implied by the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Precise Reasoning and Question Interpretation:** The primary focus should be on improving the system's ability to understand questions accurately and perform the *exact* reasoning required to answer them, avoiding extraneous information and misinterpretations.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Targeted Fine-Tuning Data:**\n    *   **Numerical Reasoning Dataset:** Create a dataset specifically focused on numerical reasoning with \"trick\" questions that require careful interpretation. Include examples where the question can be easily misinterpreted or requires a specific calculation. For example:\n        *   \"If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, how many apples does John *still have*?\" (Emphasize \"still have\").\n        *   \"The team scored 21 points in the first half and 14 points in the second half. How many points did they score *in total*?\" (Tests understanding of \"in total\").\n    *   **Constraint Handling Dataset:** Create examples where the question contains implicit constraints that the model must recognize. For example:\n        *   \"What was the *last* major battle of the war?\" (Emphasizes the \"last\" constraint).\n        *   \"List *only* the cities with a population over 1 million.\" (Emphasizes the \"only\" constraint).\n\n2.  **Multi-Stage Processing:**\n    *   **Question Analysis Module:** Implement a pre-processing step where the question is analyzed using NLP techniques (e.g., dependency parsing, semantic role labeling). This module should:\n        *   Identify the question's intent (e.g., calculation, comparison, extraction).\n        *   Extract key entities and relationships.\n        *   Explicitly define constraints (e.g., \"What is the *difference*...?\", \"List *only*...\").\n    *   **Answer Verification Module:** Implement a post-processing step that verifies the answer against the question's intent and constraints identified in the question analysis module.\n\n3.  **Intermediate Output Logging & Debugging:**\n    *   Enhance the system's logging to output intermediate reasoning steps. Specifically, log:\n        *   The output of the question analysis module (intent, entities, constraints).\n        *   The extracted information from the passage that the system deems relevant.\n        *   The reasoning steps the system performs (e.g., calculations, comparisons).\n        *   The output of the answer verification module.\n    *   This will allow you to trace the system's reasoning and pinpoint where it's deviating from the correct path.\n\n4.  **Output Refinement:**\n    *   Train the model to *only* output the final answer within the answer tags, *unless* specifically instructed otherwise in the question. Remove the extraneous explanation from the default output.\n    *   If explanations are required, train the model to provide concise and relevant explanations only.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy of 0.60 and the error patterns observed, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but with a significant risk of plateauing**. Without targeted improvements, the system will likely continue to make the same types of errors. The actionable recommendations above should provide a pathway for improvement.\n",

This should guide the information extraction from the passage.\n*   **Implement a post-processing step to verify that the answer meets the specific requirements of the question.** This step could involve checking the answer for unnecessary details or incorrect calculations.\n*   **Add print statements and intermediate outputs throughout the code** to aid in debugging and tracking the system's reasoning process. This will help to identify where the system is going wrong and why.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful, but extracted too much information.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed to identify the constraint of only providing the *trailing* amount.\n    *   solution_generation: Incorrect solution due to misinterpretation of the question.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the solution against the question's intent.\n    *   decision_making: Made a decision based on an incorrect understanding of the problem.\n*   **Sample ID 3:**\n    *   information_extraction: Successful in extracting relevant information.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed to understand the \"What happened second?\" constraint.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect answer (the wrong event).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify against the correct chronological event.\n    *   decision_making: Incorrectly determined the event that occurred second.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and the format you requested.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** The \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END\" tags are correctly used. This is good for parsing and extracting the actual answer. However, the model sometimes includes extraneous information *within* the answer tags (e.g., explaining the calculation process). While this *could* be useful for debugging, it might hinder automated evaluation or use in a system where only the final answer is needed.\n*   **Correct Answer in Success Case:** The second sample execution contains a successful response and correctly calculates \"125\" years. The calculation explanation might be more concise.\n*   **Error Analysis in Execution:** The third sample provides an erroneous response, the model provides all of the point information and fails to extract the correct difference between the points. The analysis reveals that the model knows the points scored, but fails to extract the correct answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of information extraction and simple calculations, but its reasoning and contextual understanding are weak. It can identify relevant facts but struggles to apply them correctly to answer specific questions. The system shows a vulnerability to misinterpreting numerical questions. Overall, the system is functioning at a beginner level.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system is generally able to extract relevant pieces of information from the input text.\n*   **Basic Calculation:** Performs simple arithmetic operations correctly in some cases.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Precise Reasoning:** Struggles to interpret questions correctly and perform precise, focused reasoning. The biggest weakness to address.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Lacks deep understanding of the question's context, leading to irrelevant details or incorrect assumptions.\n*   **Question Interpretation:** Frequently misinterprets the exact requirement of the question.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Fails to identify and adhere to constraints implied by the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Precise Reasoning and Question Interpretation:** The primary focus should be on improving the system's ability to understand questions accurately and perform the *exact* reasoning required to answer them, avoiding extraneous information and misinterpretations.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Targeted Fine-Tuning Data:**\n    *   **Numerical Reasoning Dataset:** Create a dataset specifically focused on numerical reasoning with \"trick\" questions that require careful interpretation. Include examples where the question can be easily misinterpreted or requires a specific calculation. For example:\n        *   \"If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, how many apples does John *still have*?\" (Emphasize \"still have\").\n        *   \"The team scored 21 points in the first half and 14 points in the second half. How many points did they score *in total*?\" (Tests understanding of \"in total\").\n    *   **Constraint Handling Dataset:** Create examples where the question contains implicit constraints that the model must recognize. For example:\n        *   \"What was the *last* major battle of the war?\" (Emphasizes the \"last\" constraint).\n        *   \"List *only* the cities with a population over 1 million.\" (Emphasizes the \"only\" constraint).\n\n2.  **Multi-Stage Processing:**\n    *   **Question Analysis Module:** Implement a pre-processing step where the question is analyzed using NLP techniques (e.g., dependency parsing, semantic role labeling). This module should:\n        *   Identify the question's intent (e.g., calculation, comparison, extraction).\n        *   Extract key entities and relationships.\n        *   Explicitly define constraints (e.g., \"What is the *difference*...?\", \"List *only*...\").\n    *   **Answer Verification Module:** Implement a post-processing step that verifies the answer against the question's intent and constraints identified in the question analysis module.\n\n3.  **Intermediate Output Logging & Debugging:**\n    *   Enhance the system's logging to output intermediate reasoning steps. Specifically, log:\n        *   The output of the question analysis module (intent, entities, constraints).\n        *   The extracted information from the passage that the system deems relevant.\n        *   The reasoning steps the system performs (e.g., calculations, comparisons).\n        *   The output of the answer verification module.\n    *   This will allow you to trace the system's reasoning and pinpoint where it's deviating from the correct path.\n\n4.  **Output Refinement:**\n    *   Train the model to *only* output the final answer within the answer tags, *unless* specifically instructed otherwise in the question. Remove the extraneous explanation from the default output.\n    *   If explanations are required, train the model to provide concise and relevant explanations only.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy of 0.60 and the error patterns observed, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but with a significant risk of plateauing**. Without targeted improvements, the system will likely continue to make the same types of errors. The actionable recommendations above should provide a pathway for improvement.\n"

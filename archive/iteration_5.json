  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach, decomposing a question into sub-questions, extracting relevant information, and synthesizing an answer using the Gemini LLM. It employs verification steps at each stage to ensure validity. The script defines functions for question decomposition (`decompose_question`), information extraction (`extract_information`), answer synthesis (`synthesize_answer`), and calling the LLM (`call_llm`). The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling these functions sequentially, using the output of one as input for the next, to generate the final answer.",

This fact, along with various other disorders, mutinies and unrest in the country created \"an acute political crisis in the capital.\" By 1921, the ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia had become corrupt and inefficient. The oil-rich nation was somewhat reliant on the nations of Britain and Russia for military and economic support. Civil wars earlier in the decade had threatened the government, and the only regular military force at the time was the Cossack Brigade. The Qajar shah in 1921 was Ahmad, who had been crowned at the age of eleven. He was considered to be a weak, incompetent ruler, especially after British, Russian and Ottoman occupations of Persia during World War I. In 1911, when the capital city, Tehran, had been seized by the Russians, armed Bakhtiaris tribemen, rather than Iranian regular troops, expelled the invaders. This further diminished the government's reputation, rendering it almost powerless in time of war. Britain, which played a major role in Persia, was dismayed by the Qajar government's inability to rule efficiently. This inefficiency was the background of a power struggle between Britain and Russia, each nation hoping to control Persia.

This fact, along with various other disorders, mutinies and unrest in the country created \"an acute political crisis in the capital.\" By 1921, the ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia had become corrupt and inefficient. The oil-rich nation was somewhat reliant on the nations of Britain and Russia for military and economic support. Civil wars earlier in the decade had threatened the government, and the only regular military force at the time was the Cossack Brigade. The Qajar shah in 1921 was Ahmad, who had been crowned at the age of eleven. He was considered to be a weak, incompetent ruler, especially after British, Russian and Ottoman occupations of Persia during World War I. In 1911, when the capital city, Tehran, had been seized by the Russians, armed Bakhtiaris tribemen, rather than Iranian regular troops, expelled the invaders. This further diminished the government's reputation, rendering it almost powerless in time of war. Britain, which played a major role in Persia, was dismayed by the Qajar government's inability to rule efficiently. This inefficiency was the background of a power struggle between Britain and Russia, each nation hoping to control Persia. On 14 January 1921, the British General Ironside chose to promote Reza Khan, who had been leading the Tabriz battalion, to lead the entire brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan's 3,000-4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade reached Tehran.",

The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The opening day of the offensive  was the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000. Gun fire wasn't the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. The living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as trench foot, shell shock, blindness/burns from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, cooties  and the \u2018Spanish Flu'.",

From February 8\u201310, 1879, Lake county was renamed Carbonate County. In 1881, Dolores County and Pitkin County were created. In 1883, Montrose, Mesa, Garfield, Eagle, Delta, and San Miguel counties were formed, leaving the total number of counties at 39. The number rose to 40 in 1885 with the creation of Archuleta County on April 14. Washington County and Logan County were both created in 1887. Between February 19 and April 16 in 1889, Morgan, Yuma, Cheyenne, Otero, Rio Blanco, Phillips, Sedgwick, Kiowa, Kit Carson, Lincoln, Prowers, Baca, and Montezuma counties were formed, bringing the total to 55. By 1900, Mineral County and Teller County had been added. On November 15, 1902, Arapahoe County split into Adams in the north and Denver was recognized as a consolidated city-county.

This will enable the system to better understand the relationships between words and phrases in the question.\n*   **Implement Semantic Similarity Measures:** Utilize semantic similarity metrics (e.g., word embeddings, sentence embeddings) to compare the question with different parts of the passage. This will help the system identify the most relevant information and avoid focusing on irrelevant details.\n*   **Add Temporal Reasoning Module:** Implement a dedicated module for temporal reasoning that can handle date calculations, time intervals, and event ordering.\n*   **Introduce Contrastive Learning:** Train the system using contrastive learning techniques, where it's presented with pairs of similar questions that require different answers. This will help the system learn to differentiate between subtle nuances in question wording.\n*   **Implement more print statements:** Add more print statements, especially when numerical computations are performed, so that one can track how numerical data and question data is extracted and utilized by the AI system.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 4:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful.

ANSWER_END blocks) reveal a key issue: The system *confidently* provides an answer, even when it's incorrect. This indicates a lack of a confidence scoring mechanism or internal validation process.\n\n*   **Output 1 (\"20 points\"):** Likely stems from error case 4 where the system calculates the sum of all points scored in field goals instead of the value of the first field goal. This directly reflects the \"Confusion between specific data and total value of data\" error pattern.\n*   **Output 2 (\"21 yards\"):** This result might come from a task where it needs to calculate the distance. This is not an error case and the model successfully retrieves this number from the passage.\n*   **Output 3 (\"10 yards\"):** This result might come from a task where it needs to calculate the distance. This is not an error case and the model successfully retrieves this number from the passage.\n\nThe consistent use of \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" delimiters suggests a structured output format, which is good for downstream processing, but needs to be accompanied by a reliability score or confidence level.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates moderate capabilities in numerical reasoning and information extraction when the question's intent is clear. However, its ability to understand nuanced language and complex relationships within the text is limited. The lack of error handling and confidence scoring raises concerns about its reliability in real-world applications. The inability to calculate time intervals is also a significant limitation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** The system reliably performs simple calculations (addition, subtraction) when the question clearly requires it.\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Successful extraction of relevant numbers from the context.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Question Intent Understanding:** The most significant weakness.  The system struggles to accurately discern the user's intended query, leading to incorrect data selection and calculations.\n*   **Semantic Understanding:** Limited ability to differentiate between similar concepts, leading to misinterpretation of the required answer.\n*   **Lack of Confidence Scoring:** The system doesn't provide any indication of its confidence in the answer, making it difficult to assess its reliability.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Question Intent Understanding**. This is the root cause of many of the observed errors.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThese recommendations focus on addressing the \"Question Intent Understanding\" weakness and improving semantic processing:\n\n1.  **Implement Question Type Classification:** Train a separate module to classify questions into different types (e.g., \"sum,\" \"difference,\" \"find specific value,\" \"temporal calculation\"). This will help the system choose the appropriate reasoning strategy.\n2.  **Develop a Relevance Scoring Mechanism:** Before performing calculations, implement a mechanism to score the relevance of different parts of the passage to the *classified* question. This can be achieved using techniques like cosine similarity between question embeddings and passage segment embeddings.\n3.  **Integrate Knowledge Graph Embedding:** Use a knowledge graph embedding technique to represent relationships between entities and concepts. This will help the system better understand the context and differentiate between similar concepts. For example, understanding the relation between \"points got on the board\" and \"total points\".\n4.  **Add an Intermediate Reasoning Step Output:** Before providing the final answer, have the system output the *reasoning steps* it took. This will allow for more granular error analysis and targeted debugging.\n5.  **Implement a Confidence Score:** After generating an answer, calculate a confidence score based on the relevance scores, the accuracy of the calculations, and the consistency of the answer with the context. Only return answers with a confidence score above a certain threshold. Implement a \"I don't know\" response if the confidence score is too low.\n6.  **Focus on Error Sample Retraining:** Prioritize retraining the model on the identified error samples (4 and 6), augmented with similar examples designed to highlight the nuances the system is missing.\n7.  **Refine Prompt Engineering (if applicable):** If the system uses prompt engineering, experiment with different prompt templates that explicitly guide the system to consider the question's specific intent. For example, add constraints like \"Answer ONLY the total points scored from the first field goal and nothing else.\"\n8. **Implement Error Logging with Context**: Log the full question, context, predicted answer, correct answer, and the reason for the error. This will enable a more in-depth error analysis and iterative improvements.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are **stable** with moderate performance. Improvement will require focused effort on addressing the key weaknesses, particularly question intent understanding and semantic processing. The success of the recommendations above will determine if the trend shifts to \"improving.\" Without these changes, the capabilities are likely to remain stable.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings using two specialized LLM agents: an Extraction Agent and a Scheduling Agent. The Extraction Agent extracts meeting details with multi-example prompting and validation, and the Scheduling Agent proposes a meeting time considering extracted details. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `extract_meeting_info` to extract details and then `schedule_meeting` to schedule the meeting. `extract_meeting_info` uses the function `call_LLM` to extract the information and then validates the data to assure quality, while the `schedule_meeting` function leverages the `call_LLM` function to schedule the meeting, proposing a time. The overall workflow involves extracting meeting information, scheduling the meeting, and handling potential errors at each stage.",

      "text_report": "## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a pattern of struggling to correctly reconcile the availability of all participants. Each sample attempts to find a common 30-minute slot, but the reasoning often contains errors in identifying who is available at what time. For example, in the first sample, it incorrectly states who is NOT available at 9:00-9:30 and makes several other inaccurate statements about availability. In the second example, it fails to incorporate the constraint that Mark wants to avoid meetings before 15:00. The third attempts to reconcile availability but also exhibits errors. There is a clear weakness in accurately processing and applying the constraints of individual schedules. The outputs include \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic capability to identify the problem, recognize the need to consider multiple schedules, and attempt to find a common slot. However, its core capability of accurately processing the schedule constraints is weak. While it can generate a potential solution, the solutions are frequently incorrect due to mishandling individual availability constraints. The system has the capacity to reason but the reasoning is flawed with incorrect factual statements about availability.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Identification:** Correctly identifies the scheduling problem.\n*   **Attempted Reasoning:** Attempts to reason about the schedules and find a common available time.\n*   **Output Structure:** Generates a structured response (though the reasoning is flawed).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Processing:** Fails to accurately process and reconcile individual availability schedules.\n*   **Reasoning Accuracy:** Exhibits flawed reasoning with incorrect statements about participant availability.\n*   **Constraint Application:** Unable to consistently apply constraints when determining meeting times.\n*   **Lack of Robust Verification:** No apparent systematic method for verifying the proposed solution against all constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Processing**, specifically the ability to accurately extract and reconcile individual availability schedules. This is fundamental to solving the scheduling problem correctly.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Structured Data Extraction and Representation (High Priority - Fix constraint processing):** Develop a dedicated function or module for extracting the schedule information for each person from the free-text format. Convert these schedules into a more structured, machine-readable format, such as a list of time intervals or a boolean matrix representing availability. Use LLM calls specifically designed to extract structured data, using few-shot examples to guide the format.\n\n    *   **Example:** Convert \"Carolyn: Available 9:00-9:30, 10:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00\" into `carolyn_schedule = [(\"9:00\", \"9:30\"), (\"10:30\", \"13:30\"), (\"14:00\", \"15:00\"), (\"15:30\", \"16:00\")]`.\n2.  **Implement Explicit Constraint Verification (Medium Priority - Reinforce solution quality):** Before proposing a solution, implement a verification function that iterates through each participant's schedule and checks if the proposed time slot is available for everyone. This function should return a boolean indicating whether all constraints are satisfied. Log these intermediate steps to ensure verification is taking place.\n3.  **Use Chain-of-Thought with Constraint Highlighting (Medium Priority - Improve reasoning transparency):** Modify the prompt to encourage the LLM to explicitly state each constraint it is considering and how the proposed solution satisfies that constraint. For example:\n\n    *   \"Considering Carolyn's schedule, she is available from 9:00-9:30. This proposed time of 9:00-9:30 satisfies Carolyn's availability.\"\n4.  **Implement Unit Tests (High Priority - Ensure regression control):** Develop a suite of unit tests with varied and complex schedules to check the correctness of the constraint processing and solution verification. Add edge cases (e.g., empty schedules, overlapping schedules, conflicting preferences). Ensure all new changes pass these tests.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but inadequate**. It consistently attempts to solve the problem, but frequently fails to produce correct solutions due to flawed constraint processing and reasoning. Implementing the recommendations above should lead to a demonstrable improvement in accuracy and reliability.\n",

This is fundamental to solving the scheduling problem correctly.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Structured Data Extraction and Representation (High Priority - Fix constraint processing):** Develop a dedicated function or module for extracting the schedule information for each person from the free-text format. Convert these schedules into a more structured, machine-readable format, such as a list of time intervals or a boolean matrix representing availability. Use LLM calls specifically designed to extract structured data, using few-shot examples to guide the format.\n\n    *   **Example:** Convert \"Carolyn: Available 9:00-9:30, 10:30-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00\" into `carolyn_schedule = [(\"9:00\", \"9:30\"), (\"10:30\", \"13:30\"), (\"14:00\", \"15:00\"), (\"15:30\", \"16:00\")]`.\n2.  **Implement Explicit Constraint Verification (Medium Priority - Reinforce solution quality):** Before proposing a solution, implement a verification function that iterates through each participant's schedule and checks if the proposed time slot is available for everyone. This function should return a boolean indicating whether all constraints are satisfied. Log these intermediate steps to ensure verification is taking place.\n3.  **Use Chain-of-Thought with Constraint Highlighting (Medium Priority - Improve reasoning transparency):** Modify the prompt to encourage the LLM to explicitly state each constraint it is considering and how the proposed solution satisfies that constraint. For example:\n\n    *   \"Considering Carolyn's schedule, she is available from 9:00-9:30. This proposed time of 9:00-9:30 satisfies Carolyn's availability.\"\n4.  **Implement Unit Tests (High Priority - Ensure regression control):** Develop a suite of unit tests with varied and complex schedules to check the correctness of the constraint processing and solution verification. Add edge cases (e.g., empty schedules, overlapping schedules, conflicting preferences). Ensure all new changes pass these tests.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but inadequate**. It consistently attempts to solve the problem, but frequently fails to produce correct solutions due to flawed constraint processing and reasoning. Implementing the recommendations above should lead to a demonstrable improvement in accuracy and reliability.\n"

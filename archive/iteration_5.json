  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting meeting information using the `extract_meeting_info` function, which leverages an LLM to parse the input question and return a JSON object with participants, duration, days, work hours, and schedules. Then, it uses the `propose_and_refine_slot` function to iteratively propose and validate meeting slots, using the LLM to suggest times and check for conflicts before refining the suggestions. The overall workflow involves parsing the request, proposing a slot, validating the slot, and refining it until a suitable time is found or the maximum attempts is reached. Function names include `call_llm`, `main`, `extract_meeting_info`, and `propose_and_refine_slot`. `call_llm` interacts with `extract_meeting_info` and `propose_and_refine_slot`. `extract_meeting_info` is called by `main` and `propose_and_refine_slot` is called by `main`.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error across all provided samples is \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This is a `JSONDecodeError`, indicating that the system attempted to parse a JSON string, but the string was empty or did not contain valid JSON data. This suggests a failure in generating or retrieving the JSON data, possibly from an LLM call or some other data processing step.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Problem Definition**: The initial instructions to the LLM are well-defined, setting the stage for a structured problem-solving process.\n2.  **Constraint-Awareness**: The system is explicitly designed to handle constraints related to participant schedules, meeting duration, and time preferences.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **JSON Parsing Failures**: The recurring \"Expecting value\" error reveals a significant weakness in the system's ability to reliably produce valid JSON outputs. This can stem from malformed LLM responses or issues within the parsing logic.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling**: The system's error handling is inadequate. Instead of providing a meaningful response or attempting to recover, it simply returns a generic error message.\n3.  **Limited Reasoning Robustness**: The system fails to handle relatively simple scheduling scenarios, indicating a lack of robustness in its reasoning or constraint-handling capabilities.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Reliability**: The most critical bottleneck is the unreliability of the LLM's JSON output. The `JSONDecodeError` prevents further processing, halting the system's ability to find a solution.\n2.  **Error Recovery Mechanisms**: The absence of error recovery mechanisms prevents the system from gracefully handling parsing failures or other unexpected events, leading to complete failure instead of a potential retry or alternative approach.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent `JSONDecodeError` points to a recurring issue in how the system interacts with the LLM or processes its outputs. It's likely that the LLM is sometimes failing to produce valid JSON, either by returning an empty string, plain text, or a string with formatting errors. The absence of any further error messages indicates the error occurs early in processing, preventing more specific errors from surfacing.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the system's **inability to handle or recover from malformed or missing JSON responses from the LLM**. This completely blocks the processing pipeline and prevents any valid solution generation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Robust JSON Parsing**: The system needs significantly more robust JSON parsing with comprehensive error handling. It should be able to detect invalid JSON, log the error, and attempt to recover (e.g., by retrying the LLM call or using a default response).\n2.  **LLM Output Validation**: Implement strict validation of LLM outputs before attempting to parse them. This could involve checking for the presence of valid JSON syntax or using regular expressions to identify potential issues.\n3.  **Error Handling and Recovery**: Improve overall error handling by implementing retry mechanisms, fallback strategies, and more informative error messages. If JSON parsing fails, the system should log the error and attempt to re-prompt the LLM, potentially with modified instructions to ensure valid JSON output.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a JSON validation step**: Before attempting to parse any JSON, use a try-except block and a JSON validator to confirm its validity. If invalid, log the raw output and trigger a re-prompt.\n2.  **Strengthen LLM prompting for JSON**: Modify the LLM prompts to explicitly request JSON output, including examples of the expected format. Add instructions to handle cases where a valid solution cannot be found (e.g., by returning a specific JSON structure indicating no solution).\n3.  **Add retry logic with exponential backoff**: If a JSON parsing error occurs, retry the LLM call with exponential backoff (e.g., wait 1 second, then 2 seconds, then 4 seconds). Limit the number of retries to prevent infinite loops.\n4.  **Implement fallback solution**: If JSON parsing consistently fails, implement a fallback solution using string parsing or a simpler, less structured approach to extract the necessary information from the LLM output. This will allow the system to continue processing, even if it cannot rely on JSON.\n5.  **Improve logging**: Add more comprehensive logging to capture the raw LLM outputs and the steps taken to process them. This will provide valuable insights for debugging and improving the system's performance.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0**: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making (all failed due to JSONDecodeError).\n*   **Sample 1**: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making (all failed due to JSONDecodeError).\n*   **Sample 2**: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making (all failed due to JSONDecodeError).\n*   **Sample 3**: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making (all failed due to JSONDecodeError).\n*   **Sample 4**: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making (all failed due to JSONDecodeError).\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of your AI system, based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines:\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs are remarkably consistent: every run results in a \"JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\".  This definitively confirms that the system consistently fails to receive or process valid JSON data.  The fact that the error occurs on line 1, column 1 indicates the JSON string is either empty or completely malformed (e.g., not starting with '{' or '[').  The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest that the error is happening *after* the LLM has provided a response, so it's something about the content of the response or the immediately subsequent parsing attempt. The fact that the same exact error happens on every single sample is very telling - it points to a systemic, design-level error rather than something intermittent with the LLM.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nCurrently, the system has **almost no functional capability.**  While the design may incorporate desirable features like constraint awareness and structured problem-solving, the consistent failure to parse JSON data prevents the system from performing *any* useful task. Essentially it's an elaborate, non-functional system.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Structured Design (Theoretical):** The design principles, such as constraint handling and problem decomposition, represent a good starting point.  However, these strengths are purely theoretical until the JSON parsing issue is resolved.\n*   **Clear Problem Definition (Theoretical):** The prompt engineering to set the stage for structured problem solving is a good foundation.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **JSON Parsing Failure (CRITICAL):** This is the dominant and show-stopping weakness. The system *consistently* fails to handle JSON responses.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling (Severe):** The error handling is insufficient, providing only a generic error message and no recovery attempts.\n*   **Reasoning Robustness (Potential):** It's impossible to assess the reasoning robustness given the JSON issue, but the error report suggests potential limitations in handling even simple scheduling scenarios.\n*   **Zero Accuracy (Critical):** the actual accuracy is zero.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe **single most important capability to focus on improving is ROBUST JSON PARSING AND LLM OUTPUT VALIDATION.** Without this, no other improvements are possible. This must be fixed *before* addressing other weaknesses.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere's a prioritized list of specific changes to implement:\n\n1.  **Implement Immediate JSON Validation with Fallback:**\n    *   **Wrap ALL LLM calls in a `try...except` block**.  This is *essential*.\n    *   Immediately after receiving a response from the LLM, before *any* parsing, add a validation step:\n\n    ```python\n    import json\n\n    try:\n        llm_response = call_llm(prompt) # Replace with your actual LLM call\n        data = json.loads(llm_response) # Parse the JSON\n        # Process the data\n    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n        # Log the raw llm_response for debugging\n        print(f\"Raw LLM Response: {llm_response}\")\n        # Implement a basic fallback\n        data = {} # Set data to an empty dict or other safe value\n    ```\n\n2.  **Strengthen JSON Prompting and Add Examples:**\n    *   Modify *all* prompts to explicitly request JSON output with *precise* formatting.\n    *   Include *multiple* examples of the expected JSON format directly in the prompt. Show examples with valid data AND examples of how to respond if no solution is found. Example:\n      ```\n      Respond with a JSON object like this:\n      {\n        \"meeting_time\": \"2024-01-01 10:00\",\n        \"reason\": \"Found suitable time\"\n      }\n\n      If you cannot find a meeting time, respond like this:\n      {\n        \"meeting_time\": null,\n        \"reason\": \"No suitable time found\"\n      }\n      ```\n3.  **Implement Basic Logging:**\n    *   Log the following:\n        *   The exact prompt sent to the LLM.\n        *   The raw, unparsed LLM response.\n        *   Any errors encountered during JSON parsing.\n        *   The fallback strategy used.\n    *   This logging will be invaluable for debugging and identifying the root cause of the JSON issues.\n4.  **Simplify the Workflow:** Temporarily *remove* any non-essential steps in the process to isolate the source of the JSON error. Focus on getting a *single*, reliable JSON response from the LLM.  Once this works, you can gradually add back complexity.\n5.  **Test with a Basic JSON Example:**\n    *   Start with a very simple prompt to the LLM: \"Return a JSON object with a single key 'status' set to 'ok'.\"\n    *   If this *still* fails to parse, the issue is likely in your `call_llm` function or the environment setup (e.g., incorrect API key, network issues).\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nThe capability trend is **declining rapidly**. The system is completely non-functional, and without immediate intervention, will remain so.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you should be able to overcome the JSON parsing issue and begin to unlock the potential of your AI system. Remember to test frequently and carefully to ensure that each change improves the system's reliability and accuracy.\n",

This will provide valuable insights for debugging and improving the system's performance.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0**: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making (all failed due to JSONDecodeError).\n*   **Sample 1**: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making (all failed due to JSONDecodeError).\n*   **Sample 2**: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making (all failed due to JSONDecodeError).\n*   **Sample 3**: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making (all failed due to JSONDecodeError).\n*   **Sample 4**: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making (all failed due to JSONDecodeError).\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of your AI system, based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines:\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs are remarkably consistent: every run results in a \"JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\".  This definitively confirms that the system consistently fails to receive or process valid JSON data.  The fact that the error occurs on line 1, column 1 indicates the JSON string is either empty or completely malformed (e.g., not starting with '{' or '[').  The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest that the error is happening *after* the LLM has provided a response, so it's something about the content of the response or the immediately subsequent parsing attempt. The fact that the same exact error happens on every single sample is very telling - it points to a systemic, design-level error rather than something intermittent with the LLM.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nCurrently, the system has **almost no functional capability.**  While the design may incorporate desirable features like constraint awareness and structured problem-solving, the consistent failure to parse JSON data prevents the system from performing *any* useful task. Essentially it's an elaborate, non-functional system.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Structured Design (Theoretical):** The design principles, such as constraint handling and problem decomposition, represent a good starting point.  However, these strengths are purely theoretical until the JSON parsing issue is resolved.\n*   **Clear Problem Definition (Theoretical):** The prompt engineering to set the stage for structured problem solving is a good foundation.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **JSON Parsing Failure (CRITICAL):** This is the dominant and show-stopping weakness. The system *consistently* fails to handle JSON responses.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling (Severe):** The error handling is insufficient, providing only a generic error message and no recovery attempts.\n*   **Reasoning Robustness (Potential):** It's impossible to assess the reasoning robustness given the JSON issue, but the error report suggests potential limitations in handling even simple scheduling scenarios.\n*   **Zero Accuracy (Critical):** the actual accuracy is zero.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe **single most important capability to focus on improving is ROBUST JSON PARSING AND LLM OUTPUT VALIDATION.** Without this, no other improvements are possible. This must be fixed *before* addressing other weaknesses.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere's a prioritized list of specific changes to implement:\n\n1.  **Implement Immediate JSON Validation with Fallback:**\n    *   **Wrap ALL LLM calls in a `try...except` block**.  This is *essential*.\n    *   Immediately after receiving a response from the LLM, before *any* parsing, add a validation step:\n\n    ```python\n    import json\n\n    try:\n        llm_response = call_llm(prompt) # Replace with your actual LLM call\n        data = json.loads(llm_response) # Parse the JSON\n        # Process the data\n    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n        # Log the raw llm_response for debugging\n        print(f\"Raw LLM Response: {llm_response}\")\n        # Implement a basic fallback\n        data = {} # Set data to an empty dict or other safe value\n    ```\n\n2.  **Strengthen JSON Prompting and Add Examples:**\n    *   Modify *all* prompts to explicitly request JSON output with *precise* formatting.\n    *   Include *multiple* examples of the expected JSON format directly in the prompt. Show examples with valid data AND examples of how to respond if no solution is found. Example:\n      ```\n      Respond with a JSON object like this:\n      {\n        \"meeting_time\": \"2024-01-01 10:00\",\n        \"reason\": \"Found suitable time\"\n      }\n\n      If you cannot find a meeting time, respond like this:\n      {\n        \"meeting_time\": null,\n        \"reason\": \"No suitable time found\"\n      }\n      ```\n3.  **Implement Basic Logging:**\n    *   Log the following:\n        *   The exact prompt sent to the LLM.\n        *   The raw, unparsed LLM response.\n        *   Any errors encountered during JSON parsing.\n        *   The fallback strategy used.\n    *   This logging will be invaluable for debugging and identifying the root cause of the JSON issues.\n4.  **Simplify the Workflow:** Temporarily *remove* any non-essential steps in the process to isolate the source of the JSON error. Focus on getting a *single*, reliable JSON response from the LLM.  Once this works, you can gradually add back complexity.\n5.  **Test with a Basic JSON Example:**\n    *   Start with a very simple prompt to the LLM: \"Return a JSON object with a single key 'status' set to 'ok'.\"\n    *   If this *still* fails to parse, the issue is likely in your `call_llm` function or the environment setup (e.g., incorrect API key, network issues).\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nThe capability trend is **declining rapidly**. The system is completely non-functional, and without immediate intervention, will remain so.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you should be able to overcome the JSON parsing issue and begin to unlock the potential of your AI system. Remember to test frequently and carefully to ensure that each change improves the system's reliability and accuracy.\n"

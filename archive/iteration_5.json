  "approach_summary": "This script solves grid transformation problems by first categorizing the transformation type (Reflection, Replication, or Arithmetic) using an LLM. Based on the identified type, it then applies a specific transformation function using another LLM call. Finally, the transformed grid is verified using an LLM to ensure correctness.\n\nThe problem is decomposed into three key steps: categorization, transformation, and verification, each leveraging a dedicated LLM prompt with a specific system instruction to act as an expert in that area. Several functions are used: `main` orchestrates the workflow, `categorize_transformation` determines the transformation type, `apply_reflection`, `apply_replication`, and `apply_arithmetic` apply the corresponding transformations, `verify_transformation` checks the result, and `call_llm` interfaces with the Gemini model.\n\nThe overall workflow begins in `main`, which calls `categorize_transformation` to get the transformation type; then based on this type, `main` calls the corresponding apply transformation function, and finally `verify_transformation` is called to verify the transformation, and the result is returned.",

However, the golden answer has multiple inconsistencies. For example, in the first row, it produces [0,0,8,8,0,2,2,2,0,0,0] which is different from the system answer [0,0,8,8,0,2,8,8,0,0,0]. Similar discrepancies exist in other rows, indicating that the golden answer doesn't follow the pattern correctly and hence it's different from the system's answer.

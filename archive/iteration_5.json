      "primary_issue": "The system consistently fails to accurately determine the availability of all participants for the final time slot, leading to incorrect recommendations.

        "Implement a final LLM-driven verification step (`verify_time_slot(proposed_time, schedules)`) before presenting the final time. This step should use a detailed prompt asking the LLM to confirm each participant's availability during the proposed time.",
        "Introduce a dedicated 'Time Slot Checking Agent' to assess whether the slot is valid, explaining its reasoning. This will improve accuracy, consistency, and traceability. This agent is to be used throughout the whole process instead of just once at the end.",
        "Refactor candidate evaluation to ensure that the proposed answer is valid. Get rid of any double-checking issues. Prioritize accurate solutions instead of doing multiple passes.",
        "Add many test cases for earliest availability scenarios. Have another agent whose job is to check the calculations by another. Debate the correct calculation for 10 rounds. All this agent is to do is to make sure that the earliest calculated is right, without concern for schedule constraints."

      "root_causes": [
        "Over-reliance on complex, multi-step reasoning within a single LLM call, increasing the likelihood of errors propagating through the reasoning chain.",

        "Prompting challenges related to extracting and reasoning about multiple schedules simultaneously.",
        "Lack of specialized agents focusing on individual subtasks (e.g., time slot verification, earliest availability calculation)."

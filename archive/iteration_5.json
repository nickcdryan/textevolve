  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings using a multi-agent system: an information extraction agent, a solution generation agent, and a verification agent. Each agent uses an LLM with a specific system instruction and prompt to perform its task with reasoning to extract meeting details, generate candidate schedules, and verify the schedule, respectively. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `extract_meeting_info`, `generate_candidate_schedules`, and `verify_schedules` in sequence, which, in turn, use `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API. The overall workflow involves extracting relevant information from a question, generating a candidate schedule based on the extracted information, and verifying the generated schedule against the original question.",

      "text_report": "Here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, focusing on actionable improvements:\n\n## RUNTIME ERROR PATTERNS\n\nBased on the raw outputs, there are no explicit Python runtime errors, suggesting the primary issues are within the LLM's reasoning and output generation, rather than the underlying code execution. However, there are implicit \"logical\" runtime errors:\n\n*   **Non-Action Errors:** Outputs 2 and 4 don't perform the desired action (proposing a schedule). This suggests the LLM is getting \"stuck\" in analysis mode rather than completing the task. This could be considered a high-level runtime error as it represents a failure to execute the requested process.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system has a rudimentary understanding of scheduling constraints and can sometimes identify conflicts. However, it struggles significantly with consistently generating valid solutions and adhering to instructions. Its ability to propose a concrete meeting time and properly validate that proposal against constraints is severely limited.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Potential for constraint awareness:** The system *sometimes* identifies schedule conflicts. This demonstrates some ability to extract and use scheduling information. The capability exists, but it's not reliable.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of consistent solution generation:** The system frequently fails to propose a specific meeting time.\n*   **Inaccurate solution verification:** When the system *does* propose a time, it often misinterprets availability and proposes invalid schedules.\n*   **Poor prompt adherence:** Doesn't consistently identify and propose the *earliest* available time.\n*   **Gets stuck in analysis mode:** Gets stuck describing how to solve the problem instead of solving it.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Solution Generation & Verification Consistency:** The system *must* consistently propose valid meeting times. Focusing on this will address the core problem of task completion and accuracy. The prompt adherence will be included in this focus, as it is also a matter of the system proposing and validating an *earliest* time.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Modify the system prompt with reinforced instructions and examples:**\n    *   **Explicit instruction:** \"Your task is to propose the *earliest* possible time for the meeting, considering all participants' schedules. You *must* provide a specific proposed time and a brief explanation. *Do not* stop at analyzing the problem. Begin your response with 'Here is the proposed time: [Day], [Start Time] - [End Time].'\"\n    *   **Add negative examples:** Include examples of *what not to do*, showing outputs that analyze the problem but don't propose a time, or propose invalid times.\n    *   **More step-by-step examples:** The example provided in the current output is good but should be expanded. Provide three to four examples with detailed reasoning, emphasizing the importance of suggesting a time, including the reasoning, and a final 'Valid'/'Invalid' Output.\n2.  **Implement a Propose-Validate-Refine loop:**\n    *   The system should generate a candidate meeting time.\n    *   A separate validation function (or a distinct LLM call) should *rigorously* check this time against *all* constraints.  This function should return a structured result (e.g., JSON) indicating whether the time is valid, and if not, *why not* (specifically identifying conflicting participants).\n    *   If the time is invalid, the system should *refine* the proposal (e.g., increment to the next available slot for the conflicting participant).  Limit the number of refinement attempts to prevent infinite loops.\n3.  **Introduce a Time Slot Generator sub-agent:**\n    *   Create a distinct agent responsible for generating *candidate* time slots. This agent should prioritize earlier times.  It could use a simple algorithm (e.g., start at the earliest possible time and increment in 30-minute intervals).\n    *   The existing system would then focus on *validating* the time slots proposed by this agent.\n4.  **Structured Availability Representation:** Change how availability is handled internally. Instead of relying on potentially ambiguous natural language descriptions, represent availability as a series of discrete time intervals for each participant. This will allow for more precise conflict detection.\n5. **Increase number of example shots**: Use multiple examples rather than single examples to provide a stronger base case.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the low accuracy, the system's capabilities are currently *stable but inadequate*. Without significant changes, there is no evidence to suggest improvement. Implementing the recommendations should lead to *improving* capabilities.\n",

This can be done by adding specific instructions and examples to the prompt. Include in system prompt instructions that are clear about suggesting times like 'Here is the proposed time: [day], [time] - [time]'\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 1:** solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n*   **Sample 2:** solution_generation, decision_making\n*   **Sample 3:** solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample 4:** solution_generation, decision_making\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, focusing on actionable improvements:\n\n## RUNTIME ERROR PATTERNS\n\nBased on the raw outputs, there are no explicit Python runtime errors, suggesting the primary issues are within the LLM's reasoning and output generation, rather than the underlying code execution. However, there are implicit \"logical\" runtime errors:\n\n*   **Non-Action Errors:** Outputs 2 and 4 don't perform the desired action (proposing a schedule). This suggests the LLM is getting \"stuck\" in analysis mode rather than completing the task. This could be considered a high-level runtime error as it represents a failure to execute the requested process.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system has a rudimentary understanding of scheduling constraints and can sometimes identify conflicts. However, it struggles significantly with consistently generating valid solutions and adhering to instructions. Its ability to propose a concrete meeting time and properly validate that proposal against constraints is severely limited.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Potential for constraint awareness:** The system *sometimes* identifies schedule conflicts. This demonstrates some ability to extract and use scheduling information. The capability exists, but it's not reliable.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of consistent solution generation:** The system frequently fails to propose a specific meeting time.\n*   **Inaccurate solution verification:** When the system *does* propose a time, it often misinterprets availability and proposes invalid schedules.\n*   **Poor prompt adherence:** Doesn't consistently identify and propose the *earliest* available time.\n*   **Gets stuck in analysis mode:** Gets stuck describing how to solve the problem instead of solving it.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Solution Generation & Verification Consistency:** The system *must* consistently propose valid meeting times. Focusing on this will address the core problem of task completion and accuracy. The prompt adherence will be included in this focus, as it is also a matter of the system proposing and validating an *earliest* time.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Modify the system prompt with reinforced instructions and examples:**\n    *   **Explicit instruction:** \"Your task is to propose the *earliest* possible time for the meeting, considering all participants' schedules. You *must* provide a specific proposed time and a brief explanation. *Do not* stop at analyzing the problem. Begin your response with 'Here is the proposed time: [Day], [Start Time] - [End Time].'\"\n    *   **Add negative examples:** Include examples of *what not to do*, showing outputs that analyze the problem but don't propose a time, or propose invalid times.\n    *   **More step-by-step examples:** The example provided in the current output is good but should be expanded. Provide three to four examples with detailed reasoning, emphasizing the importance of suggesting a time, including the reasoning, and a final 'Valid'/'Invalid' Output.\n2.  **Implement a Propose-Validate-Refine loop:**\n    *   The system should generate a candidate meeting time.\n    *   A separate validation function (or a distinct LLM call) should *rigorously* check this time against *all* constraints.  This function should return a structured result (e.g., JSON) indicating whether the time is valid, and if not, *why not* (specifically identifying conflicting participants).\n    *   If the time is invalid, the system should *refine* the proposal (e.g., increment to the next available slot for the conflicting participant).  Limit the number of refinement attempts to prevent infinite loops.\n3.  **Introduce a Time Slot Generator sub-agent:**\n    *   Create a distinct agent responsible for generating *candidate* time slots. This agent should prioritize earlier times.  It could use a simple algorithm (e.g., start at the earliest possible time and increment in 30-minute intervals).\n    *   The existing system would then focus on *validating* the time slots proposed by this agent.\n4.  **Structured Availability Representation:** Change how availability is handled internally. Instead of relying on potentially ambiguous natural language descriptions, represent availability as a series of discrete time intervals for each participant. This will allow for more precise conflict detection.\n5. **Increase number of example shots**: Use multiple examples rather than single examples to provide a stronger base case.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the low accuracy, the system's capabilities are currently *stable but inadequate*. Without significant changes, there is no evidence to suggest improvement. Implementing the recommendations should lead to *improving* capabilities.\n"

  "approach_summary": "This script schedules meetings by using LLMs to extract constraints, verify the extracted information, and find an available time slot. The problem is decomposed into three main steps: constraint extraction, verification, and time slot finding, each handled by a separate LLM call. Chain-of-thought prompting is used within each step to guide the LLM's reasoning, and the verification step acts as a quality check on the extracted constraints.",

The system consistently fails to parse the input question, leading to a generic \"Expecting value\" error.\n2.  There appears to be a lack of robust error handling or fallback mechanisms when parsing fails.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Input Parsing:** The inability to reliably extract information from the provided text is the primary bottleneck. This is evidenced by the \"Expecting value\" error, indicating a failure at the initial parsing stage.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The system crashes instead of attempting an alternative approach or providing a more informative error message.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **JSON Parsing Failure:** All the errors are the same: \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This strongly indicates a problem with the initial JSON parsing. The system likely expects a JSON format, and when it receives the natural language input, it fails immediately.\n2.  **No Fallback Strategy:** When parsing fails, the system does not attempt any alternative methods, resulting in a complete failure.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the failure to handle the natural language input and correctly parse it into a usable format for the scheduling logic. The system is expecting a JSON format but receives natural language. The JSON parsing error suggests the system is attempting to parse the entire input string as a JSON object, instead of using LLM calls to extract relevant information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Replace the rigid JSON parsing with LLM-driven information extraction. This will involve using LLM calls to extract participant schedules, meeting duration, preferred times, and other constraints from the natural language input.\n2.  **Robustness and Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage parsing failures. The system should attempt alternative parsing strategies or provide a more informative error message that guides the user or the automated system.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace JSON Parsing with LLM Calls:**\n    *   Instead of expecting a complete JSON, use LLM to decompose the problem and extract information. For example:\n        *   `participants = llm_extract_participants(question)`\n        *   `schedules = llm_extract_schedules(question)`\n        *   `constraints = llm_extract_constraints(question)`\n    *   This requires defining functions `llm_extract_participants`, `llm_extract_schedules`, and `llm_extract_constraints` that use LLM to understand and extract the relevant information.\n2.  **Implement Fallback Strategy:**\n    *   If the LLM-driven extraction fails, implement a simple fallback. This could involve a default schedule or prompt for information. More importantly, add more logs to understand why even the LLM calls failed.\n3.  **Structured Response Generation:** Use a defined format for the response (e.g., \"Here is the proposed time: ...\"). This is useful for tests.\n4. **Iterative constraint handling**: Instead of parsing and applying constraints all at once, handle them iteratively to allow refinement and debugging:\n   - Use LLM calls for each constraint type\n   - Allow constraints to be updated at each step\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 5:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 6:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 7:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 8:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 9:** information\\_extraction\n",

This strategy should also log detailed error information to aid in debugging. The strategy also needs to have more steps and more retries if the LLM calls fail.\n3. **Use Iterative Constraint Handling**: Rather than parsing all constraints at once, handle them iteratively, using LLM calls for each constraint type, allowing refinement and easier debugging. For example, one LLM call to extract participants, another for time constraints, and so on.\n4.  **Implement Structured Response Generation:** Define a consistent format for the system's responses (e.g., \"Here is the proposed time: ...\"). This will facilitate automated testing and evaluation.\n5. **Add Logging**: Log the calls to the LLM, the parameters used, and the response.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capabilities are currently **Declining**, as the system is completely non-functional. Significant improvements are required to achieve even a basic level of functionality.\n"

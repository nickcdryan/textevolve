  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM in a two-step process: rule extraction and rule application. First, the `solve_grid_transformation` function uses the `call_llm` function to extract a transformation rule from the provided example grid. Second, the extracted rule is applied to the input grid, again using `call_llm`, to generate the transformed grid. The `call_llm` function interfaces with the Gemini API to generate text based on the provided prompts and system instructions. The main function calls the solve_grid_transformation function to start the grid transformation process.",

It appears to memorize specific element positions or relationships from the training examples rather than understanding the underlying logic.\n3.  **Output Format Consistency:** While the generated code is syntactically correct, the system struggles to produce outputs that match the expected format (specifically, constructing the transformed grid correctly).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Flawed Pattern Generalization:** The inability to generalize transformation patterns from the training data to unseen inputs is the primary bottleneck. The system appears to overfit to the training examples, extracting specific indices or relationships without understanding the underlying logic.\n2.  **Insufficient Abstraction:** The system fails to abstract away the specific values in the input grid to recognize the underlying structural changes occurring in the transformation.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Incorrect Element Selection:** The generated code often selects incorrect elements or performs flawed calculations on the input grid, leading to an output that deviates significantly from the golden answer. This suggests a misunderstanding of the grid manipulation logic.\n2.  **Inconsistent Application of Logic:** The pattern applied is inconsistent with the expected output across the training examples and test examples, with the test failing to produce the same pattern as the training data.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's failure to learn and generalize the correct transformation pattern from the training data. It incorrectly identifies patterns or relationships, resulting in flawed code that extracts or manipulates elements inappropriately. The system doesn't truly \"understand\" the grid transformation; it simply tries to mimic specific examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The system needs a more robust pattern recognition mechanism that can accurately identify and generalize complex grid transformations.\n2.  **Abstraction:** Implement better abstraction capabilities to identify key features and relationships within the grids, allowing the system to focus on the transformation logic rather than specific values.\n3.  **Verification and Validation:** Improve the system's ability to verify and validate the generated solutions against the constraints and examples provided in the training data.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Introduce a more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithm:** Explore more advanced techniques for identifying patterns in the input and output grids. This could involve using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the underlying transformation rules.\n2.  **Implement data augmentation techniques:** Expand the training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing examples (e.g., rotations, reflections, translations). This can help the system learn more robust and generalizable patterns.\n3.  **Enhance abstraction capabilities:** Add a preprocessing step that converts the raw grid data into a more abstract representation. For example, the system could identify and label different regions or shapes within the grid, allowing it to focus on the relationships between these features.\n4.  **Implement a rule-based system:** Incorporate a rule-based system that defines common grid transformation operations (e.g., mirroring, rotation, cropping). The system can then use these rules to generate the transformed grid based on the identified pattern.\n5.  **Fine-tuning the prompt:** Re-writing the prompt so the AI extracts the dimensions of the output grid first. Is it a crop? Is it a filter? Or a resize. This should help the LLM identify which tool and libraries to utilize.\n6.  **Add print statements and intermediate outputs to the python code such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong:** This will help in debugging and understanding the reasoning process of the system.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly identifying the element extraction pattern)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generated code based on a flawed understanding of the pattern)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify if the generated solution aligned with the training examples)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly identifying which elements to extract)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generated incorrect JSON output)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed\n    *   solution_generation: Failed\n    *   solution_verification: Failed\n",

This indicates a complete lack of pattern generalization. It simply tries to reproduce the output by directly copying values from specific locations in the input grid. The code returns a list of a single list which includes the selected indexes, which will always be inconsistent with the output grid dimensions.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system generates a JSON output that is supposed to represent a transformed grid. However, the relationship between the input and output is unclear. The generated numbers lack context. It\u2019s unclear what the input was supposed to be.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system outputs the grid as a flat list of lists (a 2-dimensional array), but the output does not seem to match the transformation that the training examples might suggest. There appears to be little or no relationship between the input and output in this case.\n\nIn all three cases, the system completely fails to capture the underlying logic of the grid transformation. The failures are systematic and suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of the task.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates extremely limited capability in solving grid transformation tasks. Its accuracy is zero, and analysis of the execution outputs reveals fundamental flaws in pattern recognition, generalization, and problem-solving. While the system can generate syntactically correct code and attempt to extract information from the input, it completely fails to produce meaningful results or capture the intended transformations. The system is not able to do anything with the input grid other than extract it's data. The system is not performing the transformations required.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can successfully generate syntactically correct Python code.\n*   **Attempt at Information Extraction:** The system attempts to extract information from the grid based on training examples, even if the extracted information is incorrect. This demonstrates a rudimentary form of information processing, which is the start of a correct solution.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The system's inability to identify and generalize transformation patterns is a critical weakness. This prevents it from solving even simple grid transformation problems.\n*   **Abstraction:** The system fails to abstract away from specific values and identify key features or relationships within the grids. It memorizes details rather than understanding the underlying transformations.\n*   **Solution Validation:** The system is unable to validate its generated solutions against the constraints and examples provided in the training data. It blindly generates outputs without assessing their correctness.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization.** Without a robust pattern recognition mechanism, the system will continue to fail at solving even basic grid transformation problems.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based pattern recognition module:** CNNs are well-suited for image and grid-based data. Implementing a CNN could significantly improve the system's ability to identify and generalize grid transformation patterns. Focus on architectures designed for few-shot learning or meta-learning to improve performance with limited training data.\n2.  **Introduce Data Augmentation:** Expand the training data by using rotations, reflections, mirroring, translations, and noise. This forces the system to learn transformation-invariant features, leading to better generalization.\n3.  **Refine the Prompt with Dimensionality Checks:** Guide the LLM to first extract the dimensionality of the input grid and the expected dimensionality of the output grid. This simple check can significantly narrow the search space and allow the system to make use of better tools and methods for solving the grid transformation. The LLM should utilize specific libraries for solving specific types of transformations.\n4.  **Implement a Solution Verification Module:** Add a module that takes the generated code, executes it, and compares the output to the training examples. This module can use metrics like pixel-wise accuracy or structural similarity to assess the quality of the solution. If the solution is unsatisfactory, the system should be able to iterate and refine the code.\n5.  **Add logging and debugging information to the generated Python code:** Include print statements and visualisations to help you understand how the system is processing data and where the problems are.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capabilities are currently **stable (very low)**. Without significant changes, the system will likely continue to perform poorly on grid transformation tasks. The system does not demonstrate a capability to improve based on input. The underlying model needs to improve substantially.\n",

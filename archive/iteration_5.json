  "approach_summary": "The script implements a RAG-based approach with a validation loop for answering questions. It decomposes the problem into query generation, search snippet retrieval (simulated), answer generation, and solution validation. The script uses two agent roles: a problem solver/answer generator and a validator, both driven by the `call_llm` function.\n\nKey functions:\n*   `call_llm`: Interacts with the Gemini model.\n*   `generate_query_and_validate`: Generates and validates a search query against search snippets to ensure relevance.\n*   `generate_answer_with_snippets`: Generates an answer based on the provided search snippets.\n*   `solve_with_validation_loop`: Orchestrates the RAG process, incorporating a validation loop to refine the answer.\n*   `main`: Calls `solve_with_validation_loop` to return an answer to the user's question\n\nThe workflow starts with `solve_with_validation_loop`, which calls `generate_query_and_validate` and `generate_answer_with_snippets` to get an initial answer. This answer is then iteratively validated, and if found invalid, the query and answer generation steps are rerun.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) were found in the provided 'output' fields.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nBased on the limited data (only error cases), identifying strengths is difficult. However, we can infer:\n\n1.  **Attempted Question Answering:** The system at least attempts to answer the questions, even if the answer is incorrect or \"Answer not found.\" This suggests a basic functionality of question understanding and information retrieval (or at least attempted retrieval).\n2.  **Information Retrieval (Partial):** In sample 0, the system correctly identifies the year the Sazae-san strip started. In sample 2, the system retrieves a name that is at least related to the William Henry Twenhofel Medal. This suggests partial success in retrieving relevant information.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information Retrieval:** The system retrieves incorrect information from its knowledge source. In sample 2, the retrieved name is incorrect. In sample 0, the system fails to retrieve the specific date.\n2.  **Lack of Precision:** The system provides imprecise answers. In sample 0, it gives a range instead of a specific date. In sample 1, it fails to find any answer at all when an answer exists.\n3. **Answer Not Found Handling:** The system outputs \"Answer not found\" in sample 1, but there may have been information in the knowledge base that could have answered the question. The system may have been too strict in its search criteria or unable to extract the relevant information.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Knowledge Source Accuracy/Completeness:** If the knowledge source itself is incomplete or contains inaccurate information, the system will inevitably produce incorrect answers.\n2.  **Information Retrieval Precision:** The system's information retrieval mechanism is not precise enough, leading to the retrieval of irrelevant, incomplete, or incorrect information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Date Specificity:** Errors appear related to providing precise dates. The system either provides an imprecise date (sample 0) or fails to find the date at all (sample 1).\n2. **Incorrect Specific Details:** When answering questions that require finding precise details such as names, the system provides incorrect information (sample 2).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate and/or incomplete information retrieval from the knowledge source.** This manifests as providing imprecise answers, failing to find existing answers, or providing incorrect specific details. The system's retrieval mechanism needs to be improved to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval:** The system needs a more robust and precise information retrieval mechanism.\n2.  **Knowledge Source Validation:** The knowledge source needs to be validated for accuracy and completeness.\n3. **Answer Formatting:** The system should be able to format the answer in a precise manner, adhering to the level of detail requested by the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a more sophisticated information retrieval algorithm:** Explore techniques like semantic search, entity linking, and relation extraction to improve the accuracy of information retrieval.\n2.  **Implement Knowledge Source Validation:** Create an automated process to regularly validate the knowledge source against reliable external sources to identify and correct inaccuracies.\n3.  **Improve Question Understanding and Intent Recognition:** Enhance the system's ability to understand the question's intent, including the desired level of specificity.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) were found in the provided 'output' fields.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nBased on the limited data (only error cases), identifying strengths is difficult. However, we can infer:\n\n1.  **Attempted Question Answering:** The system at least attempts to answer the questions, even if the answer is incorrect or \"Answer not found.\" This suggests a basic functionality of question understanding and information retrieval (or at least attempted retrieval).\n2.  **Information Retrieval (Partial):** In sample 0, the system correctly identifies the year the Sazae-san strip started. In sample 2, the system retrieves a name that is at least related to the William Henry Twenhofel Medal. This suggests partial success in retrieving relevant information.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information Retrieval:** The system retrieves incorrect information from its knowledge source. In sample 2, the retrieved name is incorrect. In sample 0, the system fails to retrieve the specific date.\n2.  **Lack of Precision:** The system provides imprecise answers. In sample 0, it gives a range instead of a specific date. In sample 1, it fails to find any answer at all when an answer exists.\n3. **Answer Not Found Handling:** The system outputs \"Answer not found\" in sample 1, but there may have been information in the knowledge base that could have answered the question. The system may have been too strict in its search criteria or unable to extract the relevant information.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Knowledge Source Accuracy/Completeness:** If the knowledge source itself is incomplete or contains inaccurate information, the system will inevitably produce incorrect answers.\n2.  **Information Retrieval Precision:** The system's information retrieval mechanism is not precise enough, leading to the retrieval of irrelevant, incomplete, or incorrect information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Date Specificity:** Errors appear related to providing precise dates. The system either provides an imprecise date (sample 0) or fails to find the date at all (sample 1).\n2. **Incorrect Specific Details:** When answering questions that require finding precise details such as names, the system provides incorrect information (sample 2).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate and/or incomplete information retrieval from the knowledge source.** This manifests as providing imprecise answers, failing to find existing answers, or providing incorrect specific details. The system's retrieval mechanism needs to be improved to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval:** The system needs a more robust and precise information retrieval mechanism.\n2.  **Knowledge Source Validation:** The knowledge source needs to be validated for accuracy and completeness.\n3. **Answer Formatting:** The system should be able to format the answer in a precise manner, adhering to the level of detail requested by the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a more sophisticated information retrieval algorithm:** Explore techniques like semantic search, entity linking, and relation extraction to improve the accuracy of information retrieval.\n2.  **Implement Knowledge Source Validation:** Create an automated process to regularly validate the knowledge source against reliable external sources to identify and correct inaccuracies.\n3.  **Improve Question Understanding and Intent Recognition:** Enhance the system's ability to understand the question's intent, including the desired level of specificity. Use techniques like question type classification and named entity recognition. This will help to inform the information retrieval strategy and answer formatting.\n4.  **Implement more detailed logging and debugging:** Add more print statements and intermediate outputs to track the reasoning process and identify failure points more easily. This will be crucial for future debugging efforts.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information_extraction (failed to extract precise date), solution_generation (generated imprecise solution)\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction (failed to extract any relevant information), solution_generation (failed to generate any solution)\n*   **Sample 2:** information_extraction (extracted incorrect information), solution_generation (generated incorrect solution)\n",

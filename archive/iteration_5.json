  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-driven techniques with a chain-of-thought approach for scheduling meetings by extracting constraints, finding available times, and verifying the solution. It decomposes the problem into constraint extraction, verification, and solution finding. The functions `extract_constraints_with_examples`, `verify_extracted_constraints`, `find_available_times_with_examples`, and `verify_solution_with_examples` are used sequentially within the `main` function to process the input question and generate a meeting schedule. The `call_llm` function handles the interaction with the LLM.",

The system, as it stands, is only tested on 5 samples and shows perfect accuracy.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **High Accuracy:** The system correctly solved all problems in the test set, suggesting a strong understanding of the problem domain.\n*   **No Errors:** The absence of errors indicates that the system's logic and reasoning are currently functioning flawlessly within the scope of the test data.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Limited Generalization Ability:** The small dataset size severely limits the assessment of the system's ability to generalize to unseen or more complex problems. It's possible the system is overfitting to the training data or the specific characteristics of the test set.\n*   **Lack of Error Data for Analysis:** The absence of errors prevents detailed analysis of potential failure modes and areas for improvement.

The perfect accuracy on the small test set is encouraging, but the lack of error data and the limited dataset size prevent a meaningful assessment of the system's long-term trajectory.

This involves testing the system on a much larger and more diverse dataset, including edge cases, noisy data, and problems with varying complexity.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Expand the Dataset:** Create a significantly larger dataset (at least 100-200 samples) that includes a wide range of problem variations, edge cases, and potential ambiguities.\n2.  **Introduce Complexity:** Include more complex problems in the dataset that require deeper reasoning, multi-step solutions, and handling of multiple constraints.\n3.  **Add Noise and Ambiguity:** Introduce noise (e.g., irrelevant information, typos) and ambiguity (e.g., vague instructions, conflicting data) into some of the problem instances to test the system's robustness.\n4.  **Implement Data Augmentation:** Explore data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the size and diversity of the dataset by creating variations of existing problems.\n5.  **Implement a Verification Agent:** Design a verification agent that will critically evaluate the solution of the main agent in order to search for areas of improvement. This can simulate the introduction of noisy data and ambiguity.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **stable but uncertain**. The perfect accuracy on the small test set is encouraging, but the lack of error data and the limited dataset size prevent a meaningful assessment of the system's long-term trajectory. Further evaluation with a more comprehensive dataset is crucial to determine whether the system is truly improving or merely performing well on a narrow set of problem instances.\n"

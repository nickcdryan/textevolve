  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to answer questions by first determining the question type, then extracting relevant information, and finally generating the answer, using the `gemini-2.0-flash` model. The problem is decomposed into three steps: question type determination, information extraction, and answer generation. The agents used are \"expert at classifying question types\", \"expert at extracting relevant information\", and \"expert at generating correct answers.\"\n\nThe main function orchestrates the process, calling `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, and `generate_answer` sequentially. The `call_llm` function is used within the other functions to interact with the Gemini API. The workflow starts with the `main` function receiving a question, which is then passed to `determine_question_type` to classify the question. The question and its type are passed to `extract_relevant_info` which returns the relevant information from the passage. Finally, the question, its type, and the extracted information are passed to `generate_answer` which outputs the answer to the question.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: In late 1920, the Persian Soviet Socialist Republic in Rasht was preparing to march on Tehran with \"a guerrilla force of 1,500 Jangalis, Kurds, Armenians and Azerbaijanis\", reinforced by the Bolsheviks' Red Army. This fact, along with various other disorders, mutinies and unrest in the country created \"an acute political crisis in the capital.\" By 1921, the ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia had become corrupt and inefficient. The oil-rich nation was somewhat reliant on the nations of Britain and Russia for military and economic support. Civil wars earlier in the decade had threatened the government, and the only regular military force at the time was the Cossack Brigade. The Qajar shah in 1921 was Ahmad, who had been crowned at the age of eleven. He was considered to be a weak, incompetent ruler, especially after British, Russian and Ottoman occupations of Persia during World War I. In 1911, when the capital city, Tehran, had been seized by the Russians, armed Bakhtiaris tribemen, rather than Iranian regular troops, expelled the invaders. This further diminished the government's reputation, rendering it almost powerless in time of war. Britain, which played a major role in Persia, was dismayed by the Qajar government's inability to rule efficiently. This inefficiency was the background of a power struggle between Britain and Russia, each nation hoping to control Persia. On 14 January 1921, the British General Ironside chose to promote Reza Khan, who had been leading the Tabriz battalion, to lead the entire brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan's 3,000-4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade reached Tehran.\n\nQUESTION: Which event happened first, The march on Tehran or the corruption of the Qajar dynasty of Persia?",

      "original_passage": "In late 1920, the Persian Soviet Socialist Republic in Rasht was preparing to march on Tehran with \"a guerrilla force of 1,500 Jangalis, Kurds, Armenians and Azerbaijanis\", reinforced by the Bolsheviks' Red Army. This fact, along with various other disorders, mutinies and unrest in the country created \"an acute political crisis in the capital.\" By 1921, the ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia had become corrupt and inefficient. The oil-rich nation was somewhat reliant on the nations of Britain and Russia for military and economic support. Civil wars earlier in the decade had threatened the government, and the only regular military force at the time was the Cossack Brigade. The Qajar shah in 1921 was Ahmad, who had been crowned at the age of eleven. He was considered to be a weak, incompetent ruler, especially after British, Russian and Ottoman occupations of Persia during World War I. In 1911, when the capital city, Tehran, had been seized by the Russians, armed Bakhtiaris tribemen, rather than Iranian regular troops, expelled the invaders. This further diminished the government's reputation, rendering it almost powerless in time of war. Britain, which played a major role in Persia, was dismayed by the Qajar government's inability to rule efficiently. This inefficiency was the background of a power struggle between Britain and Russia, each nation hoping to control Persia. On 14 January 1921, the British General Ironside chose to promote Reza Khan, who had been leading the Tabriz battalion, to lead the entire brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan's 3,000-4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade reached Tehran.",

The Rams would welcome back Steven Jackson to the lineup after weeks of sitting out with a thigh injury. Jackson gave the Rams a good enough boost to strike first with a first possession field goal by Josh Brown from 23 yards. Brown would kick a 51-yard field goal to give the Rams a 6-0 lead. In the second quarter, the Dolphins responded as RB Ronnie Brown got a 3-yard TD run. The Rams would answer with Brown making a 33-yard field goal, but Miami replied with kicker Dan Carpenter getting a 37-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Dolphins increased their lead as Carpenter got a 47-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, St. Louis tried to keep up as Brown made a 38-yard field goal, yet Miami answered right back with Carpenter nailing a 42-yard field goal.

While the calculations themselves *might* be correct in some cases (though the Error Analysis suggests otherwise), the lack of a preceding explanation makes it difficult to understand *why* those specific numbers were chosen and how they relate to the question. This obscures the system's reasoning process and makes debugging more challenging.

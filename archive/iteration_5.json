This approach attempts\nto mitigate the difficulty of extracting global transformation rules by\nfocusing on local relationships and applying them systematically. This also\nincludes a validation check partway through the pipeline to see if the transformation\nrule appears to be well-formed\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union\n\ndef call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):\n    \"\"\"Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response.

  "approach_summary": "The script addresses grid transformation problems by analyzing and transforming each cell individually, leveraging LLMs for both analysis and transformation steps. It decomposes the problem into analyzing individual cell transformations based on their neighborhood and training examples, and then applying these transformations to determine the output value for each cell. The agent acts as a grid transformation expert. The functions `analyze_cell_transformation` analyzes cell transformations, `apply_cell_transformation` determines the output value of a cell, `check_rule_well_formed` validates the transformation rule, `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the cell-by-cell transformation process, and `call_llm` interacts with the Gemini LLM. The workflow begins with extracting a transformation rule with `check_rule_well_formed`, followed by iterating through each cell in the grid, analyzing its transformation with `analyze_cell_transformation`, applying the transformation with `apply_cell_transformation`, and constructing the final output grid within `solve_grid_transformation`.",

It suggests a problem with how the extracted values from the input grid are processed and used in the output grid generation. This likely originates in the string parsing and conversion.\n*   **Error: Could not convert '\\```\\n0\\n```' to integer.** (Sample 1): Similar to Sample 0, this highlights a conversion error when trying to transform a value read from the input grid.\n*   **Script execution timed out (60 seconds)** (Sample 2): This indicates a performance bottleneck. The system was unable to complete the transformation within the allocated time, suggesting inefficient code or excessive computational complexity.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Rule Extraction:** The system appears to successfully extract the rule based on the training examples, as evidenced by the message \"Rule successfully extracted\" in Samples 0 and 1. This suggests the system's pattern recognition for learning from examples is functioning.\n*   **Input Grid Parsing:** The system is able to parse the input grid data, suggesting proper implementation of the input parsing and data structure handling.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Type Conversion/String Parsing:** The recurring \"Could not convert...to integer\" errors demonstrate a vulnerability in handling string representations of numerical data extracted from the grid. This suggests a lack of robustness in input validation and conversion.\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** The timeout error suggests that the transformation logic can be inefficient, especially with larger or more complex input grids. This could be caused by nested loops or other algorithms that scale poorly.\n*   **Error Handling:** When a conversion error occurs, the system simply returns \"Error: Invalid transformation\" without providing specific details about the nature of the error. The error message returned to the end user is too vague and unhelpful.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **String to Integer Conversion Errors:** The inability to reliably convert extracted strings into integers is a fundamental bottleneck that prevents the system from generating valid output grids.\n*   **Inefficient Transformation Logic:** The timeout suggests that the system's core transformation algorithm is not optimized for performance, leading to execution time issues.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Type Conversion Errors:** A recurring pattern of failure to convert strings to integers, indicating a problem with the string parsing/conversion logic after rule extraction.\n*   **Generic Error Messages:** The system provides generic error messages like \"Error: Invalid transformation\", making it difficult to pinpoint the root cause of the problem.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the unreliable conversion of string representations of grid values to integers, causing the transformation logic to fail. This is likely due to inconsistent formatting or unexpected characters within the extracted strings.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Robust String to Integer Conversion:** Implement more robust string parsing and conversion logic, including error handling for unexpected characters or formatting issues. Employ try-except blocks with error specific logging to improve debugging.\n*   **Optimize Transformation Algorithm:** Analyze the transformation algorithm for performance bottlenecks and optimize it using techniques such as memoization, vectorized operations (if applicable), or algorithm redesign.\n*   **Detailed Error Reporting:** Improve error reporting by providing more specific error messages that identify the nature of the conversion error, the input value causing the error, and the location in the code where the error occurred.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Input Validation:** Before attempting to convert a grid value, validate that it is a valid numerical string (e.g., using regular expressions).\n*   **Exception Handling:** Wrap the string to integer conversion code in a `try-except` block to catch `ValueError` exceptions. Log the exception details, including the offending string.\n*   **Profiling:** Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the transformation algorithm.\n*   **Algorithm Review:** Review the algorithm to assess time complexity and potential optimizations, such as eliminating redundant computations.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Successful\n    *   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (due to type conversion error)\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: N/A\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Successful\n    *   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (due to type conversion error)\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: N/A\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Likely successful, but timeout prevents confirmation\n    *   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (due to timeout)\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: N/A\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**System Overview:** This AI system is designed to learn transformation rules from examples and apply them to generate output grids. However, current performance is significantly hampered by issues with type conversion and computational efficiency.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs confirm the error analysis provided earlier.\n\n*   **Sample 0 & 1:** The system acknowledges successful rule extraction, which indicates a functional pattern recognition capability. However, the immediate \"Could not convert...to integer\" error highlights a critical flaw in the subsequent processing of input data. The error message \"Error: Invalid transformation\" is uninformative and fails to provide any context for debugging. The '```text\\n1\\n```' and '```\\n0\\n```' strings also suggest the presence of surrounding characters/formatting that the conversion logic isn't handling properly, which might originate from the delimiters used when parsing the input.\n\n*   **Sample 2:** The \"Timeout\" result suggests a severe performance bottleneck. It's impossible to determine whether the rule extraction or subsequent processing steps are the source of the issue, but it does confirm that the system is unable to handle the computational demands within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nThese execution outputs strongly suggest the need for more robust input data handling and a more efficient transformation algorithm.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has very limited capabilities due to the severe errors encountered. While the system appears to extract rules correctly, its inability to reliably process input data or execute transformations within a reasonable time renders it practically unusable.

    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**System Overview:** This AI system is designed to learn transformation rules from examples and apply them to generate output grids. However, current performance is significantly hampered by issues with type conversion and computational efficiency.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs confirm the error analysis provided earlier.\n\n*   **Sample 0 & 1:** The system acknowledges successful rule extraction, which indicates a functional pattern recognition capability. However, the immediate \"Could not convert...to integer\" error highlights a critical flaw in the subsequent processing of input data. The error message \"Error: Invalid transformation\" is uninformative and fails to provide any context for debugging. The '```text\\n1\\n```' and '```\\n0\\n```' strings also suggest the presence of surrounding characters/formatting that the conversion logic isn't handling properly, which might originate from the delimiters used when parsing the input.\n\n*   **Sample 2:** The \"Timeout\" result suggests a severe performance bottleneck. It's impossible to determine whether the rule extraction or subsequent processing steps are the source of the issue, but it does confirm that the system is unable to handle the computational demands within a reasonable timeframe.\n\nThese execution outputs strongly suggest the need for more robust input data handling and a more efficient transformation algorithm.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has very limited capabilities due to the severe errors encountered. While the system appears to extract rules correctly, its inability to reliably process input data or execute transformations within a reasonable time renders it practically unusable. The accuracy of 0.00 (0/3) underscores this deficiency.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Rule Extraction (Potential):** The \"Rule successfully extracted\" messages suggest a potentially strong ability to learn from examples. *This needs to be verified with corrected code.*\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **String to Integer Conversion:** Inability to reliably convert strings to integers.\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** The system times out, indicating a critical performance bottleneck in its transformation algorithm.\n*   **Error Reporting:** Error messages are too vague and provide insufficient information for debugging.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **robust string to integer conversion**.

  "approach_summary": "The script transforms a grid based on training examples using a direct LLM transformation approach with pre-processing and post-processing steps to fix formatting. It decomposes the problem into extracting training data and input, transforming the input grid using the LLM, and then cleaning the output to ensure correct formatting. There is no explicit agent role defined aside from the LLM, which is prompted to act as a grid transformer.\n\nThe functions used are: `main` (orchestrates the workflow), `preprocess_question` (extracts training examples and test input using regex), `transform_grid_with_formatting` (calls the LLM with a specific prompt and system instruction to transform the grid), `post_process_grid` (attempts to fix formatting errors in the grid string), and `call_llm` (calls the Gemini API with the prompt and system instruction).\n\nThe overall workflow is: `main` calls `preprocess_question` to get training examples and test input, then calls `transform_grid_with_formatting` which uses `call_llm` to get the transformed grid, and finally calls `post_process_grid` to clean the output before returning the result.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError reported in the provided error cases' \"output\" fields. However, the incorrect formatting of the output in sample_id 1 (e.g., missing brackets and quotation marks) suggests underlying issues related to string manipulation and array construction within the system's code.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to pinpoint specific strengths. However, we can infer the following:\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system seems to be able to identify patterns to some extent, as it attempts to transform the input grid based on the training examples.\n2.  **Element Transformation:** The system seems to be able to identify specific elements and transform them, like changing numbers.\n3. **No obvious code errors**: There are no errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError, which suggests the underlying system can perform basic operations without error.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Spatial Reasoning & Grid Structure Understanding:** The system struggles to understand the spatial relationships and structural aspects of the grids. It doesn't correctly interpret how elements in the input grid map to the output grid in terms of rows and columns.\n2.  **Abstraction and Generalization:** The system fails to generalize the transformations learned from the training examples to the test input accurately. It's not able to abstract the underlying rules governing the grid transformations.\n3.  **Output Formatting:** The system exhibits issues with constructing the output grid in the correct format, leading to syntactically incorrect and unusable results (as seen in sample\\_id 1).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Failure to Capture Grid Transformations:** The system's core problem is its inability to learn and apply the underlying transformation logic from the training examples to the test input. It doesn't understand how patterns relate between input and output grids.\n2.  **Output Formatting and Structure:** Even if the system correctly identified the transformed elements, its inability to format the output correctly renders the results useless. The code must construct arrays correctly.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Grid Size:** The system often produces grids of incorrect dimensions (sample\\_id 0).\n2.  **Disordered Element Placement:** The system sometimes places elements in the output grid in a different order than the golden answer (sample\\_id 1).\n3.  **Incorrect Element Transformation:** Although less apparent, there are cases where the system transforms elements incorrectly based on the learned pattern (sample\\_id 2).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's **lack of robust spatial reasoning and abstraction capabilities**. It cannot correctly identify the correspondence between elements in the input and output grids or generalize the patterns learned from the training examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Spatial Reasoning:** Implement a more sophisticated approach to analyzing the spatial relationships between elements in the input and output grids, potentially using convolution neural networks or similar techniques.\n2.  **Transformation Rule Learning:** Develop a more effective method for learning the transformation rules from the training examples, possibly through explicit rule extraction or more advanced machine learning models.\n3.  **Output Formatting:** Ensure that the system has robust mechanisms for constructing arrays and formatting outputs based on the detected structure from the training examples.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs clearly demonstrate the system's failures.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output grid `[[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]` is filled with only the number 1. The correct answer would have required several different values (e.g., 0 and 8 from the example). It also doesn't map to the right grid size.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The output is a single string. The structure is completely broken. The output demonstrates incorrect formatting with missing brackets, quotation marks, and improper list structures. The elements themselves might also be incorrect, but the broken format makes it difficult to ascertain.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The output grid `[[0,0,8,8,0,2,2,2,0,0,0],[0,0,8,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,0],[0,2,2,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,8,8,2,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2,8,8,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,2,8,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]` has some of the right element values (0, 2, and 8), but they are in the wrong places. Spatial reasoning is weak, as elements are not correctly mapped to their corresponding locations based on the underlying pattern.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has very limited capabilities in solving the ARC tasks. Its accuracy is essentially zero. While it can identify basic patterns and element transformations to some extent, its inability to perform spatial reasoning, generalize learned rules, and format outputs correctly severely hinders its performance. The system struggles with even the most basic aspects of grid manipulation and pattern recognition necessary for ARC tasks.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Element Identification:** The system *attempts* to identify key elements or values present in the grid.\n*   **No code errors:** No code errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError are being thrown, suggesting that at least the underlying system can perform basic operations without crashing.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:**  The system's most critical weakness is its complete inability to understand and reason about spatial relationships within the grid.\n*   **Abstraction/Generalization:** It fails to generalize learned patterns from training examples to the test input.\n*   **Output Formatting & Structure:** The system produces outputs with incorrect formatting, making the results unusable. This suggests fundamental issues with array/list manipulation and string construction.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Spatial Reasoning**. Without the ability to understand spatial relationships within the grid, the system cannot even begin to solve the tasks.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Layers (CNNs) for Spatial Feature Extraction:** Integrate convolutional layers into the model's architecture. CNNs are specifically designed to extract spatial features and patterns from images or grid-like data. This could help the system learn relevant spatial relationships between elements.  Start with small, simple CNN architectures.\n2.  **Introduce Relative Positional Encoding:** Embed information about the relative positions of elements within the grid. This could be done by adding positional encoding vectors to the element representations. This helps the model understand the context of each element based on its location.\n3.  **Develop a Robust Output Formatting Function:** Create a dedicated function responsible for constructing the output grid in the correct format. This function should take the transformed elements and grid dimensions as input and return a properly formatted array/list. Add comprehensive unit tests to ensure the function produces valid JSON output for various grid sizes and element types.\n4.  **Implement Debugging and Visualization Tools:**  Add extensive logging and visualization tools to monitor the internal state of the system during execution. This will make it easier to identify the source of errors and track the flow of data through the system. For example, visualize the feature maps learned by the convolutional layers.\n5. **Increase diversity of training data:** Add more training data and tasks.\n6. **Add Input validation:** Add input validation to ensure that all inputs match the correct grid shape and have the correct values.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0/3 accuracy), the capability trend is **Declining** or at best **Stable at a very low level**.  Significant improvements are needed to move towards a positive trend.\n",

However, the incorrect formatting of the output in sample_id 1 (e.g., missing brackets and quotation marks) suggests underlying issues related to string manipulation and array construction within the system's code.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to pinpoint specific strengths. However, we can infer the following:\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system seems to be able to identify patterns to some extent, as it attempts to transform the input grid based on the training examples.\n2.  **Element Transformation:** The system seems to be able to identify specific elements and transform them, like changing numbers.\n3. **No obvious code errors**: There are no errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError, which suggests the underlying system can perform basic operations without error.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Spatial Reasoning & Grid Structure Understanding:** The system struggles to understand the spatial relationships and structural aspects of the grids. It doesn't correctly interpret how elements in the input grid map to the output grid in terms of rows and columns.\n2.  **Abstraction and Generalization:** The system fails to generalize the transformations learned from the training examples to the test input accurately. It's not able to abstract the underlying rules governing the grid transformations.\n3.  **Output Formatting:** The system exhibits issues with constructing the output grid in the correct format, leading to syntactically incorrect and unusable results (as seen in sample\\_id 1).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Failure to Capture Grid Transformations:** The system's core problem is its inability to learn and apply the underlying transformation logic from the training examples to the test input. It doesn't understand how patterns relate between input and output grids.\n2.  **Output Formatting and Structure:** Even if the system correctly identified the transformed elements, its inability to format the output correctly renders the results useless. The code must construct arrays correctly.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Grid Size:** The system often produces grids of incorrect dimensions (sample\\_id 0).\n2.  **Disordered Element Placement:** The system sometimes places elements in the output grid in a different order than the golden answer (sample\\_id 1).\n3.  **Incorrect Element Transformation:** Although less apparent, there are cases where the system transforms elements incorrectly based on the learned pattern (sample\\_id 2).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's **lack of robust spatial reasoning and abstraction capabilities**. It cannot correctly identify the correspondence between elements in the input and output grids or generalize the patterns learned from the training examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Spatial Reasoning:** Implement a more sophisticated approach to analyzing the spatial relationships between elements in the input and output grids, potentially using convolution neural networks or similar techniques.\n2.  **Transformation Rule Learning:** Develop a more effective method for learning the transformation rules from the training examples, possibly through explicit rule extraction or more advanced machine learning models.\n3.  **Output Formatting:** Ensure that the system has robust mechanisms for constructing arrays and formatting outputs based on the detected structure from the training examples. The code must have strong array construction capabilities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce Spatial Encoding:** Represent the grid elements with spatial embeddings that capture their relative positions within the grid.\n2.  **Implement a Rule Extractor:** Analyze the training examples to explicitly extract the transformation rules, such as \"replace element X with Y if it's in row A and column B.\"\n3.  **Enhance Array Construction Code:** Strengthen the part of the code that constructs the array to make sure brackets and quotation marks are in the right places.

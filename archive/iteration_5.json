  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-step chain-of-thought approach with verification to solve grid transformation problems. It decomposes the problem into rule extraction, rule application, and output formatting, using the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini LLM for each step. The agent roles involved are rule extraction expert, rule verification expert, rule application expert, and formatting expert. The `call_llm` function sends prompts to the Gemini LLM, and `analyze_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process by calling `call_llm` multiple times with different prompts and system instructions, while `main` serves as the entry point and error handler. The workflow involves extracting a rule from examples, verifying the rule, applying it to a test input, and formatting the output.",

The numbers in the grids represent different colors, and your job is to identify the underlying abstract pattern or rule used across all training example pairs and apply it to new test input.\n\n                                0: Black (sometimes interpreted as background/empty)\n                                1: Blue\n                                2: Red\n                                3: Green\n                                4: Yellow\n                                5: Gray\n                                6: Pink\n                                7: Orange\n                                8: Cyan\n                                9: Purple\n\n\n                                These tasks involve abstract reasoning and visual pattern recognition operations such as:\n                                - Pattern recognition and completion\n                                - Object identification and manipulation\n                                - Spatial transformations (rotation, reflection, translation, movement, groupings, sizes, etc.)\n                                - Color/shape transformations\n                                - Counting and arithmetic operations\n                                - Boolean operations (AND, OR, XOR)\n\n                                First, analyze each example pair carefully and examine the similarities across different example pairs. Look for consistent abstract rules across example pairs that transform each input into its corresponding output. There is a single meta rule or meta transformation sequence that applies to all the example training pairs. Then apply the inferred rule to solve the test case.\n\n                                Explain your reasoning and describe the transformation rule you've identified. Lastly, you MUST provide the output grid as the test output.\n\n\n                                \n                                Example 1:\nInput Grid:\n[\n  [3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3,

      "output": "Rule extraction failed (attempt 1/3): INVALID: The rule description is inconsistent and ambiguous. While it correctly identifies that the output grid is composed of rows that are not entirely composed of a single repeating element (rows with only 7s, 8s, and 1s respectively), the explanation of how the output grid is formed is unclear and varies across examples. Specifically, the dimensions of the output are not consistently derived. The final rule applied to the test input makes sense given the preceding analysis, but it's not consistently described throughout the examples and requires significant inference to arrive at the correct transformation. In example 1, the output dimensions are 2x4 and in example 3 they are 6x5, but there are no rows with consistent elements, instead rows with different elements such as 1 and 3.\n\nRule extraction failed (attempt 2/3): INVALID: The proposed rule is inaccurate and incomplete. The rule attempts to extract a subgrid where all elements in the chosen rows and columns are the same and remove alternating values. However, the training examples exhibit a different pattern.\n\nSpecifically, the output grid is created from rows where color is consistent (either the first or last row color), and the width of the resulting subgrid is the number of contiguous elements of that row color from the beginning of the row. The row index is the index of the color rows.\n\nFor example 1, the input grid is composed of colors 3 and 7. Row colors at the top and bottom are 3. The first contiguous block of elements of color 3 contains 4 elements. The output grid is a 2x4 grid.\nFor example 2, the input grid is composed of colors 1 and 8. Row colors at the top and bottom are 1. The first contiguous block of elements of color 1 contains all 11 elements. The output grid is a 3x(2) grid, selecting only the first two columns with color 1.\nFor example 3, the input grid is composed of colors 1 and 3. Row colors at the top and bottom are 3. The first contiguous block of elements of color 3 contains 5 elements. The output grid is a 6x5 grid.\n\nThe proposed rule does not accurately capture this pattern. Therefore, it is invalid.\n\nRule extraction failed (attempt 3/3): INVALID: The proposed rule is not coherent across all examples. In example 1, only rows where the majority are 7 are considered while the other examples take rows where the majority value is repeated across all examples. In addition, the rule for columns is never fully applied, the explanation is vague and inconsistent.\n\nANSWER_START\n```python\n[\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

While it correctly identifies that the output grid is composed of rows that are not entirely composed of a single repeating element (rows with only 7s, 8s, and 1s respectively), the explanation of how the output grid is formed is unclear and varies across examples. Specifically, the dimensions of the output are not consistently derived. The final rule applied to the test input makes sense given the preceding analysis, but it's not consistently described throughout the examples and requires significant inference to arrive at the correct transformation. In example 1, the output dimensions are 2x4 and in example 3 they are 6x5, but there are no rows with consistent elements, instead rows with different elements such as 1 and 3.\n\nRule extraction failed (attempt 2/3): INVALID: The proposed rule is inaccurate and incomplete. The rule attempts to extract a subgrid where all elements in the chosen rows and columns are the same and remove alternating values. However, the training examples exhibit a different pattern.\n\nSpecifically, the output grid is created from rows where color is consistent (either the first or last row color), and the width of the resulting subgrid is the number of contiguous elements of that row color from the beginning of the row. The row index is the index of the color rows.\n\nFor example 1, the input grid is composed of colors 3 and 7. Row colors at the top and bottom are 3. The first contiguous block of elements of color 3 contains 4 elements. The output grid is a 2x4 grid.\nFor example 2, the input grid is composed of colors 1 and 8. Row colors at the top and bottom are 1. The first contiguous block of elements of color 1 contains all 11 elements. The output grid is a 3x(2) grid, selecting only the first two columns with color 1.\nFor example 3, the input grid is composed of colors 1 and 3. Row colors at the top and bottom are 3. The first contiguous block of elements of color 3 contains 5 elements. The output grid is a 6x5 grid.\n\nThe proposed rule does not accurately capture this pattern. Therefore, it is invalid.\n\nRule extraction failed (attempt 3/3): INVALID: The proposed rule is not coherent across all examples. In example 1, only rows where the majority are 7 are considered while the other examples take rows where the majority value is repeated across all examples. In addition, the rule for columns is never fully applied, the explanation is vague and inconsistent.\n\nANSWER_START\n```python\n[\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

However, the repeated \"Rule extraction failed\" messages indicate a core logical flaw in the system's ability to correctly interpret and apply the transformation rules. The errors are logical failures, not runtime exceptions.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Iterative Rule Extraction:** The system attempts rule extraction multiple times (3 attempts), showing a degree of robustness in trying different approaches.\n2.  **Detailed Failure Analysis:** The system generates detailed explanations as to why each rule extraction attempt failed, demonstrating some capacity for self-critique.\n3.  **Python Code Generation:** The system still attempts to generate a Python representation of the grid, indicating the generation component is at least running.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Rule Interpretation:** The system struggles to derive a consistent transformation rule that applies across all training examples. This is evident from the \"INVALID: The proposed rule is not coherent across all examples\" messages.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning Deficiencies:** The system has difficulties understanding and applying spatial transformations like subgrid extraction, element replacement, and pattern recognition in the grid structures.\n3.  **Lack of Numerical Reasoning:** When examples require numerical or mathematical transformations (like determining the size of the resulting grid), the system appears to fail in finding relations between grid elements or calculating outputs based on those relationships.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Robust Rule Derivation:** The core bottleneck is the ability to consistently and accurately derive the underlying transformation rule from the training examples. The explanations provided for the training examples are often vague and inconsistent.\n2.  **Spatial Pattern Recognition:** The inability to robustly recognize and apply spatial patterns within the grids severely limits the system's performance on these tasks.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Vague and Inconsistent Explanations:** The rule descriptions are often vague, using terms like \"majority\" or \"first occurrence\" without precise definitions or consistent application across examples.\n2.  **Incorrect Subgrid Extraction:** The system attempts to extract subgrids based on faulty logic, leading to outputs that do not resemble the golden answers. This issue ties into the spatial reasoning deficiency.\n3.  **Color/Shape Confusion:** The system doesn't always correctly identify and distinguish the unique elements or the patterns created by those elements.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate rule extraction** due to a lack of robust spatial reasoning and pattern recognition abilities. The system fails to consistently identify and apply the correct transformation rules across all training examples, leading to incorrect outputs for the test input. It needs to be better at extracting information and generating rules from the visual patterns.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Spatial Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to identify and manipulate spatial patterns within the grids.\n2.  **Precise Rule Definition:** Develop a more rigorous and unambiguous approach to defining transformation rules.\n3.  **Consistent Application of Rules:** Ensure that the derived rules are consistently applied across all training examples and the test input.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Spatial Feature Extraction:** Add a module for extracting spatial features from the grids, such as identifying connected components, detecting symmetries, calculating distances between objects, and extracting subgrids based on various criteria. This would greatly enhance the \"information\\_extraction\" capability.\n2.  **Formal Rule Representation:** Use a formal language or data structure to represent transformation rules. This would enforce clarity and consistency in rule definition, making it easier to reason about and apply the rules. For example, use a declarative language that expresses what the rule *is*, not how to *execute* it.\n3.  **Verification Step in Rule Application:** Incorporate a verification step after applying a rule to a training example. Compare the generated output with the provided output and identify any discrepancies. Use this feedback to refine the rule or explore alternative rule candidates. This step could greatly improve \"solution\\_verification\".\n4.  **More Robust Counting Strategies:** Add the capability for numerical reasoning, specifically counting the occurrence of various colors and the size of color segments.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (incorrectly extracting the key features)\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed (applying wrong constraints, resulting in incorrect subgrid dimensions)\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (generating a matrix that does not follow the original rules)\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed (unable to verify solution as the initial rules are incorrect)\n*   decision\\_making: Failed (unable to make a correct decision of what the output matrix should look like).\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed\n*   decision\\_making: Failed\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed\n*   decision\\_making: Failed\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System for Grid Transformation\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis. The \"Rule extraction failed\" messages are the dominant theme, indicating a fundamental problem in the system's reasoning process.  Here's a breakdown of issues:\n\n*   **Repetitive Failure:**  Each attempt to extract a rule fails, and the justifications are often lengthy, complex, and ultimately point to inconsistencies in the logic.  The system *identifies* the issues but cannot *correct* them.\n*   **Conflicting Strategies:** Different attempts at rule extraction use different heuristics (e.g., \"majority color,\" \"first occurrence\"), suggesting a lack of a unified approach or a good strategy for selecting which heuristic to apply.\n*   **Hallucination and Misinterpretation:** The system describes patterns that are not actually present in the training examples.  This suggests that the \"information\\_extraction\" module is generating incorrect or misleading features.\n*   **Code Generation Ineffectiveness:** While Python code is generated, it's always incorrect. This component is not contributing to the task but merely executing flawed logic. The lack of output examples means it's difficult to ascertain where the code fails to fully extract the rule.\n*   **Inconsistent Explanation of Rules:** The rules are vague and use qualitative terms. The system cannot formalize rules.\n*   **Lack of Numerical Reasoning:** The system cannot count or compare colors or grid sizes.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a *very limited* capability for grid transformation. While it can attempt to analyze the training examples and generate Python code, its core function \u2013 deriving accurate and consistent transformation rules \u2013 is fundamentally broken. The system is proficient at identifying *why* it is failing, but is unable to correct course to extract a correct answer.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Detailed Failure Analysis (Potential):**  The detailed error messages *could* be a strength if the system could learn from them.  Right now, they are just elaborate descriptions of failure.\n*   **Iterative Approach:**  Attempting multiple rule extraction attempts is valuable, but it needs to be coupled with a better strategy for choosing and refining the rules.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Rule Extraction:** This is the most critical weakness. The system cannot reliably derive transformation rules from examples.\n*   **Poor Spatial Reasoning:**  The system lacks the ability to understand and manipulate spatial relationships within the grids.\n*   **Inconsistent Rule Application:** Even when a rule seems plausible, it is not applied consistently across all examples.\n*   **Lack of Formal Rule Representation:** The rule descriptions are too vague and qualitative, hindering reasoning and application.\n*   **No Numerical Reasoning:** Unable to count or compare values across the grid.\n*   **Lack of Self-Correction:** The system identifies the correct rule in the test input, but continues with the same process to produce the same incorrect result.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate rule extraction**. Without a robust and reliable rule extraction process, all other components are rendered ineffective.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Develop a Formal Rule Representation:** Move away from qualitative descriptions.  Use a formal language (e.g., a custom grammar or a set of logical predicates) to represent transformation rules.  This will force the system to be more precise and consistent. Consider incorporating numerical variables.\n2.  **Implement Spatial Feature Extraction (Prioritized):** The single most important recommendation. Add a dedicated module for extracting key spatial features from the grids. Focus on:\n    *   **Connected Components:**  Identify and characterize regions of connected cells with the same value.\n    *   **Symmetry Detection:**  Detect horizontal, vertical, and diagonal symmetries.\n    *   **Distance Calculations:**  Compute distances between objects or regions.\n    *   **Subgrid Extraction:**  Implement flexible subgrid extraction based on various criteria (e.g., based on the location of a specific value, based on the size of a connected component).\n3.  **Implement a Verification Loop with Feedback (Critical):**  After each rule extraction attempt, apply the rule to the training examples. *Automatically* compare the generated outputs to the ground truth. Use the discrepancies to:\n    *   **Refine the Rule:** Adjust the rule parameters to better fit the data.\n    *   **Re-weight Feature Importance:** If using a model to select features, adjust the weights based on the verification results.\n    *   **Explore Alternative Rules:** If the discrepancies are too large, discard the current rule and explore alternative candidates.\n4.  **Introduce a \"Counting\" Primitive:** The system struggles with numerical relationships. Implement a mechanism for counting the occurrences of specific values or patterns within the grid. This could be a separate module or integrated into the feature extraction process.\n5.  **Improve Explanation Coherence:** While detailed explanations are helpful, they need to be structured and consistent. Ensure the explanations align with the final rule being applied. The iterative improvement can be tied to better explanations.\n6.  **Implement a Robust Counting Module:** Add the capability for numerical reasoning, specifically counting the occurrence of various colors and the size of color segments.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining.** The system identifies the error, but cannot self-correct, meaning the analysis of the training inputs are improving, but this is not translating to a better result. The system is still at 0% accuracy.\n",

The errors are logical failures, not runtime exceptions.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Iterative Rule Extraction:** The system attempts rule extraction multiple times (3 attempts), showing a degree of robustness in trying different approaches.\n2.  **Detailed Failure Analysis:** The system generates detailed explanations as to why each rule extraction attempt failed, demonstrating some capacity for self-critique.\n3.  **Python Code Generation:** The system still attempts to generate a Python representation of the grid, indicating the generation component is at least running.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Rule Interpretation:** The system struggles to derive a consistent transformation rule that applies across all training examples. This is evident from the \"INVALID: The proposed rule is not coherent across all examples\" messages.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning Deficiencies:** The system has difficulties understanding and applying spatial transformations like subgrid extraction, element replacement, and pattern recognition in the grid structures.\n3.  **Lack of Numerical Reasoning:** When examples require numerical or mathematical transformations (like determining the size of the resulting grid), the system appears to fail in finding relations between grid elements or calculating outputs based on those relationships.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Robust Rule Derivation:** The core bottleneck is the ability to consistently and accurately derive the underlying transformation rule from the training examples. The explanations provided for the training examples are often vague and inconsistent.\n2.  **Spatial Pattern Recognition:** The inability to robustly recognize and apply spatial patterns within the grids severely limits the system's performance on these tasks.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Vague and Inconsistent Explanations:** The rule descriptions are often vague, using terms like \"majority\" or \"first occurrence\" without precise definitions or consistent application across examples.\n2.  **Incorrect Subgrid Extraction:** The system attempts to extract subgrids based on faulty logic, leading to outputs that do not resemble the golden answers. This issue ties into the spatial reasoning deficiency.\n3.  **Color/Shape Confusion:** The system doesn't always correctly identify and distinguish the unique elements or the patterns created by those elements.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate rule extraction** due to a lack of robust spatial reasoning and pattern recognition abilities. The system fails to consistently identify and apply the correct transformation rules across all training examples, leading to incorrect outputs for the test input. It needs to be better at extracting information and generating rules from the visual patterns.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Spatial Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to identify and manipulate spatial patterns within the grids.\n2.  **Precise Rule Definition:** Develop a more rigorous and unambiguous approach to defining transformation rules.\n3.  **Consistent Application of Rules:** Ensure that the derived rules are consistently applied across all training examples and the test input.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Spatial Feature Extraction:** Add a module for extracting spatial features from the grids, such as identifying connected components, detecting symmetries, calculating distances between objects, and extracting subgrids based on various criteria. This would greatly enhance the \"information\\_extraction\" capability.\n2.  **Formal Rule Representation:** Use a formal language or data structure to represent transformation rules. This would enforce clarity and consistency in rule definition, making it easier to reason about and apply the rules. For example, use a declarative language that expresses what the rule *is*, not how to *execute* it.\n3.  **Verification Step in Rule Application:** Incorporate a verification step after applying a rule to a training example. Compare the generated output with the provided output and identify any discrepancies. Use this feedback to refine the rule or explore alternative rule candidates. This step could greatly improve \"solution\\_verification\".\n4.  **More Robust Counting Strategies:** Add the capability for numerical reasoning, specifically counting the occurrence of various colors and the size of color segments.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (incorrectly extracting the key features)\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed (applying wrong constraints, resulting in incorrect subgrid dimensions)\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (generating a matrix that does not follow the original rules)\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed (unable to verify solution as the initial rules are incorrect)\n*   decision\\_making: Failed (unable to make a correct decision of what the output matrix should look like).\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed\n*   decision\\_making: Failed\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed\n*   decision\\_making: Failed\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System for Grid Transformation\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis. The \"Rule extraction failed\" messages are the dominant theme, indicating a fundamental problem in the system's reasoning process.  Here's a breakdown of issues:\n\n*   **Repetitive Failure:**  Each attempt to extract a rule fails, and the justifications are often lengthy, complex, and ultimately point to inconsistencies in the logic.  The system *identifies* the issues but cannot *correct* them.\n*   **Conflicting Strategies:** Different attempts at rule extraction use different heuristics (e.g., \"majority color,\" \"first occurrence\"), suggesting a lack of a unified approach or a good strategy for selecting which heuristic to apply.\n*   **Hallucination and Misinterpretation:** The system describes patterns that are not actually present in the training examples.  This suggests that the \"information\\_extraction\" module is generating incorrect or misleading features.\n*   **Code Generation Ineffectiveness:** While Python code is generated, it's always incorrect. This component is not contributing to the task but merely executing flawed logic. The lack of output examples means it's difficult to ascertain where the code fails to fully extract the rule.\n*   **Inconsistent Explanation of Rules:** The rules are vague and use qualitative terms. The system cannot formalize rules.\n*   **Lack of Numerical Reasoning:** The system cannot count or compare colors or grid sizes.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a *very limited* capability for grid transformation. While it can attempt to analyze the training examples and generate Python code, its core function \u2013 deriving accurate and consistent transformation rules \u2013 is fundamentally broken. The system is proficient at identifying *why* it is failing, but is unable to correct course to extract a correct answer.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Detailed Failure Analysis (Potential):**  The detailed error messages *could* be a strength if the system could learn from them.  Right now, they are just elaborate descriptions of failure.\n*   **Iterative Approach:**  Attempting multiple rule extraction attempts is valuable, but it needs to be coupled with a better strategy for choosing and refining the rules.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Rule Extraction:** This is the most critical weakness. The system cannot reliably derive transformation rules from examples.\n*   **Poor Spatial Reasoning:**  The system lacks the ability to understand and manipulate spatial relationships within the grids.\n*   **Inconsistent Rule Application:** Even when a rule seems plausible, it is not applied consistently across all examples.\n*   **Lack of Formal Rule Representation:** The rule descriptions are too vague and qualitative, hindering reasoning and application.\n*   **No Numerical Reasoning:** Unable to count or compare values across the grid.\n*   **Lack of Self-Correction:** The system identifies the correct rule in the test input, but continues with the same process to produce the same incorrect result.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate rule extraction**. Without a robust and reliable rule extraction process, all other components are rendered ineffective.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Develop a Formal Rule Representation:** Move away from qualitative descriptions.  Use a formal language (e.g., a custom grammar or a set of logical predicates) to represent transformation rules.  This will force the system to be more precise and consistent. Consider incorporating numerical variables.\n2.  **Implement Spatial Feature Extraction (Prioritized):** The single most important recommendation. Add a dedicated module for extracting key spatial features from the grids. Focus on:\n    *   **Connected Components:**  Identify and characterize regions of connected cells with the same value.\n    *   **Symmetry Detection:**  Detect horizontal, vertical, and diagonal symmetries.\n    *   **Distance Calculations:**  Compute distances between objects or regions.\n    *   **Subgrid Extraction:**  Implement flexible subgrid extraction based on various criteria (e.g., based on the location of a specific value, based on the size of a connected component).\n3.  **Implement a Verification Loop with Feedback (Critical):**  After each rule extraction attempt, apply the rule to the training examples. *Automatically* compare the generated outputs to the ground truth. Use the discrepancies to:\n    *   **Refine the Rule:** Adjust the rule parameters to better fit the data.\n    *   **Re-weight Feature Importance:** If using a model to select features, adjust the weights based on the verification results.\n    *   **Explore Alternative Rules:** If the discrepancies are too large, discard the current rule and explore alternative candidates.\n4.  **Introduce a \"Counting\" Primitive:** The system struggles with numerical relationships. Implement a mechanism for counting the occurrences of specific values or patterns within the grid. This could be a separate module or integrated into the feature extraction process.\n5.  **Improve Explanation Coherence:** While detailed explanations are helpful, they need to be structured and consistent. Ensure the explanations align with the final rule being applied. The iterative improvement can be tied to better explanations.\n6.  **Implement a Robust Counting Module:** Add the capability for numerical reasoning, specifically counting the occurrence of various colors and the size of color segments.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining.** The system identifies the error, but cannot self-correct, meaning the analysis of the training inputs are improving, but this is not translating to a better result. The system is still at 0% accuracy.\n"

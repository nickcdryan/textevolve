  "approach_summary": "The script addresses factual questions using an iterative refinement and extraction approach driven by the Gemini LLM. It starts by generating an initial search query from the input question and simulating information retrieval. If the retrieved information is insufficient, the question is refined using the LLM, followed by another round of information retrieval. Finally, the answer is extracted and verified.\n\nThe agent roles involved are search query generator, information sufficiency assessor, question refiner, question answering system, and validation expert.\n\nKey functions include:\n- `call_llm`: Used to interact with the Gemini LLM to generate search queries, assess sufficiency, refine questions, extract answers, and verify the extracted answer.\n- `main`: Orchestrates the entire process, iteratively refining the question, retrieving information, and extracting the answer.",

The system consistently returns \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable,\" indicating a failure in the reasoning or information retrieval process, rather than a runtime exception.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Clear Output Formatting:** The system consistently uses \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags, indicating a structured output format.\n*   **Error Handling:** The system handles cases where it cannot find or validate an answer, returning \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable\" instead of crashing.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval/Validation Failure:** The system frequently fails to retrieve or validate information needed to answer the questions. This is evident from the \"Could not be validated\" and \"Unavailable\" responses.\n*   **Lack of Transparency in Failure:** The system doesn't provide any insight into why it couldn't validate or find the answer. This makes debugging difficult.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Knowledge Base Access/Search:** The primary bottleneck is likely the system's ability to access and effectively search its knowledge base or external sources to find the answer to the question.\n*   **Validation Process:** The validation process seems overly strict or prone to failure, causing the system to reject potentially correct answers or fail to retrieve data.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **\"Could not be validated\" is a recurring error message,** suggesting a systemic problem with the validation component.\n*   **Lack of Specificity:** The error messages are very generic (\"Could not be validated,\" \"Unavailable\"). This makes it difficult to diagnose the root cause.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inability to reliably retrieve and validate information from the knowledge source**. This leads to \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable\" responses, hindering the system's ability to answer questions. The validation logic is likely too sensitive or the knowledge retrieval is inaccurate.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Improve the accuracy and robustness of the knowledge retrieval component. This might involve using more sophisticated search algorithms, improving the quality of the knowledge base, or adding more relevant information sources.\n*   **Validation Logic:** Review and relax the validation logic. Investigate what criteria are being used for validation and why they are frequently failing. Consider providing more informative error messages that indicate the specific reason for validation failure.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement More Detailed Logging:** Add logging to the information retrieval and validation components to track the search queries, retrieved information, and validation criteria. This will provide valuable insights into why the system is failing.\n*   **Refine Knowledge Base Indexing and Search:** Evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the knowledge base indexing and search mechanisms. Consider using techniques like semantic search or entity linking to improve retrieval performance.\n*   **Implement Error Feedback Loop:** When the system fails to validate an answer, implement a mechanism to analyze the failed query and automatically improve the knowledge retrieval process.\n*   **Relax Validation Criteria (Cautiously):** Experiment with less strict validation criteria to reduce the number of false negatives.

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**Overall System Performance:** The AI system is currently underperforming, with an accuracy of 0.00 (0/3). The system consistently fails to provide valid answers, indicating significant issues in information retrieval, validation, and overall reasoning capabilities. The system exhibits structured output formatting and basic error handling, but these are overshadowed by its inability to deliver correct or validated information.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs demonstrate a consistent pattern of failure. The system returns \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable\" across all test cases. The presence of \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags indicates that the system is attempting to structure its output, even when unable to find or validate a valid response. The lack of specific error messages makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of failure for each test case. The consistent failure indicates a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system's claimed capabilities of information extraction, solution generation, solution verification, and decision-making are not effectively demonstrated. While the system attempts to apply these capabilities, the high failure rate suggests that the underlying mechanisms are either flawed or insufficiently robust. The ability to structure outputs and handle basic errors are positive aspects, but the core functionalities are severely limited by issues in information retrieval and validation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Output Formatting:** The system consistently uses \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags, which simplifies parsing and integration into other systems.\n*   **Basic Error Handling:** The system returns \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable\" instead of crashing or throwing exceptions when it encounters issues.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval and Validation:** The primary weakness is the system's inability to retrieve relevant information and validate its accuracy. This results in a high failure rate and limits the system's usefulness.\n*   **Lack of Specificity in Error Messages:** The generic error messages (\"Could not be validated,\" \"Unavailable\") provide little insight into the underlying cause of the failure, hindering debugging and improvement efforts.\n*   **Limited Reasoning Capabilities:** Given the consistently \"Unavailable\" response, it appears the system struggles to perform logical reasoning or inference.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Retrieval and Validation**. Improving the accuracy and reliability of this component is crucial for enhancing the system's overall performance and usability. The system needs to reliably find and validate information before it can generate useful solutions.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Detailed Logging for Information Retrieval and Validation:** Add detailed logging to capture the search queries, retrieved information, validation criteria, and specific reasons for validation failure. This will provide valuable insights into the root cause of the \"Could not be validated\" errors. Log all possible search queries that were triggered and their corresponding results, including both successful and failed attempts. This will help to understand if the right information is being searched for, but not found, or if the wrong information is being searched for in the first place.\n2.  **Refine Knowledge Base Indexing and Search Mechanisms:** Evaluate the knowledge base indexing and search algorithms to identify areas for improvement. Consider using techniques like semantic search, entity linking, or improved keyword extraction to enhance retrieval accuracy. This also includes verifying that the AI model can access the knowledge base properly and that the knowledge base contains all necessary information.\n3.  **Relax Validation Criteria and Introduce Confidence Scores:** Carefully review and relax the validation criteria to reduce false negatives. Implement a confidence scoring system for retrieved information to allow the system to provide potentially valid answers even if they don't meet strict validation criteria. The output could indicate lower confidence answers accordingly, allowing for human review.\n4.  **Implement a Feedback Loop for Failed Validations:** When the system fails to validate an answer, implement a mechanism to analyze the failed query and automatically improve the knowledge retrieval process. This could involve adjusting search queries, refining validation criteria, or adding new information to the knowledge base.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **declining**. Without significant improvements to the information retrieval and validation processes, the system will remain largely unusable. Immediate and focused action is needed to reverse this trend and unlock the system's potential.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no explicit runtime errors (like JSONDecodeError, TypeError) present in the provided 'output' fields. The system consistently returns \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable,\" indicating a failure in the reasoning or information retrieval process, rather than a runtime exception.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Clear Output Formatting:** The system consistently uses \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags, indicating a structured output format.\n*   **Error Handling:** The system handles cases where it cannot find or validate an answer, returning \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable\" instead of crashing.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval/Validation Failure:** The system frequently fails to retrieve or validate information needed to answer the questions. This is evident from the \"Could not be validated\" and \"Unavailable\" responses.\n*   **Lack of Transparency in Failure:** The system doesn't provide any insight into why it couldn't validate or find the answer. This makes debugging difficult.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Knowledge Base Access/Search:** The primary bottleneck is likely the system's ability to access and effectively search its knowledge base or external sources to find the answer to the question.\n*   **Validation Process:** The validation process seems overly strict or prone to failure, causing the system to reject potentially correct answers or fail to retrieve data.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **\"Could not be validated\" is a recurring error message,** suggesting a systemic problem with the validation component.\n*   **Lack of Specificity:** The error messages are very generic (\"Could not be validated,\" \"Unavailable\"). This makes it difficult to diagnose the root cause.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inability to reliably retrieve and validate information from the knowledge source**. This leads to \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable\" responses, hindering the system's ability to answer questions. The validation logic is likely too sensitive or the knowledge retrieval is inaccurate.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Improve the accuracy and robustness of the knowledge retrieval component. This might involve using more sophisticated search algorithms, improving the quality of the knowledge base, or adding more relevant information sources.\n*   **Validation Logic:** Review and relax the validation logic. Investigate what criteria are being used for validation and why they are frequently failing. Consider providing more informative error messages that indicate the specific reason for validation failure.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement More Detailed Logging:** Add logging to the information retrieval and validation components to track the search queries, retrieved information, and validation criteria. This will provide valuable insights into why the system is failing.\n*   **Refine Knowledge Base Indexing and Search:** Evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the knowledge base indexing and search mechanisms. Consider using techniques like semantic search or entity linking to improve retrieval performance.\n*   **Implement Error Feedback Loop:** When the system fails to validate an answer, implement a mechanism to analyze the failed query and automatically improve the knowledge retrieval process.\n*   **Relax Validation Criteria (Cautiously):** Experiment with less strict validation criteria to reduce the number of false negatives. However, be careful not to introduce more incorrect answers.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n*   **Sample 2:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**Overall System Performance:** The AI system is currently underperforming, with an accuracy of 0.00 (0/3). The system consistently fails to provide valid answers, indicating significant issues in information retrieval, validation, and overall reasoning capabilities. The system exhibits structured output formatting and basic error handling, but these are overshadowed by its inability to deliver correct or validated information.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs demonstrate a consistent pattern of failure. The system returns \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable\" across all test cases. The presence of \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags indicates that the system is attempting to structure its output, even when unable to find or validate a valid response. The lack of specific error messages makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of failure for each test case. The consistent failure indicates a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system's claimed capabilities of information extraction, solution generation, solution verification, and decision-making are not effectively demonstrated. While the system attempts to apply these capabilities, the high failure rate suggests that the underlying mechanisms are either flawed or insufficiently robust. The ability to structure outputs and handle basic errors are positive aspects, but the core functionalities are severely limited by issues in information retrieval and validation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Output Formatting:** The system consistently uses \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags, which simplifies parsing and integration into other systems.\n*   **Basic Error Handling:** The system returns \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable\" instead of crashing or throwing exceptions when it encounters issues.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval and Validation:** The primary weakness is the system's inability to retrieve relevant information and validate its accuracy. This results in a high failure rate and limits the system's usefulness.\n*   **Lack of Specificity in Error Messages:** The generic error messages (\"Could not be validated,\" \"Unavailable\") provide little insight into the underlying cause of the failure, hindering debugging and improvement efforts.\n*   **Limited Reasoning Capabilities:** Given the consistently \"Unavailable\" response, it appears the system struggles to perform logical reasoning or inference.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Retrieval and Validation**. Improving the accuracy and reliability of this component is crucial for enhancing the system's overall performance and usability. The system needs to reliably find and validate information before it can generate useful solutions.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Detailed Logging for Information Retrieval and Validation:** Add detailed logging to capture the search queries, retrieved information, validation criteria, and specific reasons for validation failure. This will provide valuable insights into the root cause of the \"Could not be validated\" errors. Log all possible search queries that were triggered and their corresponding results, including both successful and failed attempts. This will help to understand if the right information is being searched for, but not found, or if the wrong information is being searched for in the first place.\n2.  **Refine Knowledge Base Indexing and Search Mechanisms:** Evaluate the knowledge base indexing and search algorithms to identify areas for improvement. Consider using techniques like semantic search, entity linking, or improved keyword extraction to enhance retrieval accuracy. This also includes verifying that the AI model can access the knowledge base properly and that the knowledge base contains all necessary information.\n3.  **Relax Validation Criteria and Introduce Confidence Scores:** Carefully review and relax the validation criteria to reduce false negatives. Implement a confidence scoring system for retrieved information to allow the system to provide potentially valid answers even if they don't meet strict validation criteria. The output could indicate lower confidence answers accordingly, allowing for human review.\n4.  **Implement a Feedback Loop for Failed Validations:** When the system fails to validate an answer, implement a mechanism to analyze the failed query and automatically improve the knowledge retrieval process. This could involve adjusting search queries, refining validation criteria, or adding new information to the knowledge base.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **declining**. Without significant improvements to the information retrieval and validation processes, the system will remain largely unusable. Immediate and focused action is needed to reverse this trend and unlock the system's potential.\n"

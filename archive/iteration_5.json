  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to schedule meetings by extracting participants and constraints from a given question, then finding a suitable meeting time. It decomposes the problem into participant extraction, constraint extraction, and solution generation, using chain-of-thought reasoning and a verification loop for participant extraction. The core function, `main`, orchestrates this process using helper functions `extract_participants_with_repair`, `extract_constraints_structured`, `solve_meeting_problem_with_feedback`, and `call_llm` to interact with the LLM. The workflow is to extract participants, extract constraints, solve the scheduling problem using the LLM and return the proposed time.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and instructions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs reveal several critical issues that confirm the weaknesses identified in the error analysis:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system correctly identifies constraints but incorrectly concludes a meeting is impossible on Monday solely due to Daniel's unavailability. It overlooks that the other participants might be available at other times on Monday. This exhibits a failure to explore all possibilities within the constraints. It also misinterprets Daniel's constraint (\"no meetings on Monday\") as an inability to schedule at all, instead of a preference.\n*   **Sample 1:** This output is simply the answer \"Monday 14:30 to 15:00\" without reasoning or context. From the error report, we know it's an incorrect time given the constraints. This demonstrates a significant failure in solution generation.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system finds overlapping availability and then fails to select the correct, earliest, possible time.\n*   **Sample 3:** The system finds a valid solution, but not the earliest.\n*   **Sample 4:** The system proposes a later time slot on Tuesday when an earlier time slot was available on Monday.\n*   **Sample 5:** The system proposes a later time when an earlier one was possible.\n*   **Sample 6:** Misinterprets a constraint.\n*   **Sample 7:** Incorrectly states there is no possible time.\n*   **Sample 9:** Breakdown of constraints is good, but the earliest time isn't found.\n\nThese outputs highlight the system's struggle to accurately interpret scheduling constraints, identify valid meeting times, and prioritize solutions based on stated preferences, especially earliest availability.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of scheduling constraints but consistently fails to generate correct and optimal solutions. Its strengths lie in constraint analysis, but weaknesses in constraint interpretation and solution generation render the system largely ineffective. Accuracy is low (10%).\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Constraint Identification:** Ability to identify individual constraints.\n*   **Initial Logical Reasoning:** Basic attempt to cross-reference availability.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Schedule Interpretation:** Inaccurate interpretation of busy/available times, including misinterpreting negated times.\n*   **Optimal Solution Selection:** Inability to reliably choose the *earliest* or otherwise preferred time.\n*   **Consistent Constraint Application:** Failure to consistently apply all constraints when generating solutions.\n*   **Complete Solution Space Exploration:** Fails to find possible meeting times even within constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most crucial capability to improve is **Accurate Schedule Interpretation and Solution Generation**. Without this, the entire system fails. Prioritization of this improvement focus is supported by the **PRIMARY ISSUE** analysis.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the error analysis and sample outputs, here are the specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Refine Information Extraction Prompt with Clear Examples:**  Modify the information extraction prompt to include explicit examples demonstrating how to interpret \"busy\" schedules. Provide examples showing *how to derive available* slots from busy slots. The examples should cover different scenarios like one-hour and half-hour meetings and meetings with multiple busy slots. For instance:\n\n    ```\n    Example 1:\n    Schedule: John is busy from 10:00 to 10:30.\n    Available: John is available from 9:00 to 10:00 and from 10:30 to 17:00.\n\n    Example 2:\n    Schedule: Sarah is busy from 14:00 to 15:00 and from 16:00 to 16:30.\n    Available: Sarah is available from 9:00 to 14:00, from 15:00 to 16:00, and from 16:30 to 17:00.\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement Dedicated Availability Verification Step:** After the LLM extracts the schedules, add a new step where it verifies its understanding of each person's availability. The step would involve presenting the extracted schedule and asking the LLM to list the available time slots.  For example:\n\n    ```\n    Extracted Schedule: John is busy from 10:00 to 10:30.\n\n    Verification Question: Based on this schedule, what times is John available between 9:00 and 17:00? Please list the available time slots.\n    ```\n\n    The output of this verification step should be explicitly checked for consistency with the original schedule.\n\n3.  **Introduce a Time Interval Checker Function:** Implement a Python function that takes a list of busy times and a meeting duration as input and returns a list of available time slots of the specified duration. Use this function to pre-process schedule information before feeding it to the LLM.\n\n4.  **Develop Explicit Prioritization Logic with Step-By-Step Reasoning:** Explicitly add a prioritization step to prompt to ensure that identified solutions can be sorted based on the earliest availability.\n\n    *   **Identify all valid solution times.**\n    *   **Sort solutions based on earliest start time.**\n    *   **Reason about which solution is therefore the earliest.**\n5.  **Implement Limited Attempts**: Make sure that any iterative process includes a maximum attempt limiter.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the low accuracy and consistent errors, the capability trend is currently **stable but critically low**. Without significant intervention and the implementation of the suggested improvements, the system is unlikely to improve.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, the system's ability to interpret schedules accurately, generate valid solutions, and prioritize them based on preferences should significantly improve, leading to a higher accuracy and more reliable scheduling outcomes.\n",

If a meeting is from 10:00 to 10:30, the system frequently fails to understand that it means the participants are busy *during* that period, not available.\n*   **Incorrect Handling of Time Intervals:** The system sometimes has trouble with time intervals, such as finding one-hour or half-hour blocks that satisfy all constraints.\n*   **Disregard for \"Earliest Availability\":** Even when the system identifies several valid time slots, it often fails to select the absolute earliest, indicating a flaw in the logic that prioritizes based on this constraint.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the system's inability to accurately and consistently determine participants' availability based on their existing schedules, combined with a weak ability to prioritize available slots based on preference criteria.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Information Extraction:** Improve the system's ability to extract and interpret busy/available slots accurately.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Ensure all constraints, including preferences like \"earliest availability,\" are consistently applied in solution generation.\n*   **Solution Generation:** Improve the logic for generating valid meeting times that meet duration requirements and respect all constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n*   **Refine Information Extraction Prompt:** Create a more robust prompt for extracting time constraints. Use examples in the prompt to ensure the LLM understands how to interpret \"busy\" schedules to derive \"available\" schedules.\n*   **Implement a Dedicated Availability Verification Step:** After extracting individual schedules, add a verification step where the LLM confirms its understanding of each participant's availability. This could involve presenting the schedule back to the LLM in a different format and asking it to confirm available slots.\n*   **Introduce a Time Interval Checker Function:** Develop a function (potentially deterministic Python code) that can check for continuous availability over the required meeting duration, given a set of busy times. Feed the output into the LLM.\n*   **Develop Explicit Prioritization Logic:** Implement an explicit step where the system sorts potential solutions based on the \"earliest availability\" constraint. It should first identify all valid solutions and then sort them by start time.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   constraint_handling: Incorrectly interpreted \"no meetings on Monday\" as a general inability to schedule the meeting on Monday, rather than a preference.\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   solution_generation: Generated a time slot (14:30 to 15:00) that doesn't work, with other possible slots that were earlier in the day.\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   solution_generation: Chose 12:30-13:30 instead of the golden's answer.\n*   **Sample 3:**\n    *   solution_generation: Found a valid solution, 11:30-12:00, but the golden answer was later in the day.\n*   **Sample 4:**\n    *   solution_generation: Proposes 12:30-13:30 on Tuesday where 14:00-15:00 on Monday was possible.\n*   **Sample 5:**\n    *   solution_generation: Proposes 16:00 - 16:30 when 14:00 - 14:30 could have worked, given the condition.\n*   **Sample 6:**\n    *   information_extraction: Misinterpreted \"no meetings the whole week\" to mean Megan is unavailable, which isn't the same thing.\n*   **Sample 7:**\n    *   solution_generation: Incorrectly states there is no possible time, missing Tuesday 12:00 - 13:00.\n*   **Sample 9:**\n    *   solution_generation: Provides a good breakdown of constraints, but fails to find the *earliest* appropriate time. States 9:30-10:00 when the golden answer says 9:00-9:30.\n\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and instructions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs reveal several critical issues that confirm the weaknesses identified in the error analysis:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system correctly identifies constraints but incorrectly concludes a meeting is impossible on Monday solely due to Daniel's unavailability. It overlooks that the other participants might be available at other times on Monday. This exhibits a failure to explore all possibilities within the constraints. It also misinterprets Daniel's constraint (\"no meetings on Monday\") as an inability to schedule at all, instead of a preference.\n*   **Sample 1:** This output is simply the answer \"Monday 14:30 to 15:00\" without reasoning or context. From the error report, we know it's an incorrect time given the constraints. This demonstrates a significant failure in solution generation.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system finds overlapping availability and then fails to select the correct, earliest, possible time.\n*   **Sample 3:** The system finds a valid solution, but not the earliest.\n*   **Sample 4:** The system proposes a later time slot on Tuesday when an earlier time slot was available on Monday.\n*   **Sample 5:** The system proposes a later time when an earlier one was possible.\n*   **Sample 6:** Misinterprets a constraint.\n*   **Sample 7:** Incorrectly states there is no possible time.\n*   **Sample 9:** Breakdown of constraints is good, but the earliest time isn't found.\n\nThese outputs highlight the system's struggle to accurately interpret scheduling constraints, identify valid meeting times, and prioritize solutions based on stated preferences, especially earliest availability.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of scheduling constraints but consistently fails to generate correct and optimal solutions. Its strengths lie in constraint analysis, but weaknesses in constraint interpretation and solution generation render the system largely ineffective. Accuracy is low (10%).\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Constraint Identification:** Ability to identify individual constraints.\n*   **Initial Logical Reasoning:** Basic attempt to cross-reference availability.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Schedule Interpretation:** Inaccurate interpretation of busy/available times, including misinterpreting negated times.\n*   **Optimal Solution Selection:** Inability to reliably choose the *earliest* or otherwise preferred time.\n*   **Consistent Constraint Application:** Failure to consistently apply all constraints when generating solutions.\n*   **Complete Solution Space Exploration:** Fails to find possible meeting times even within constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most crucial capability to improve is **Accurate Schedule Interpretation and Solution Generation**. Without this, the entire system fails. Prioritization of this improvement focus is supported by the **PRIMARY ISSUE** analysis.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the error analysis and sample outputs, here are the specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Refine Information Extraction Prompt with Clear Examples:**  Modify the information extraction prompt to include explicit examples demonstrating how to interpret \"busy\" schedules. Provide examples showing *how to derive available* slots from busy slots. The examples should cover different scenarios like one-hour and half-hour meetings and meetings with multiple busy slots. For instance:\n\n    ```\n    Example 1:\n    Schedule: John is busy from 10:00 to 10:30.\n    Available: John is available from 9:00 to 10:00 and from 10:30 to 17:00.\n\n    Example 2:\n    Schedule: Sarah is busy from 14:00 to 15:00 and from 16:00 to 16:30.\n    Available: Sarah is available from 9:00 to 14:00, from 15:00 to 16:00, and from 16:30 to 17:00.\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement Dedicated Availability Verification Step:** After the LLM extracts the schedules, add a new step where it verifies its understanding of each person's availability. The step would involve presenting the extracted schedule and asking the LLM to list the available time slots.  For example:\n\n    ```\n    Extracted Schedule: John is busy from 10:00 to 10:30.\n\n    Verification Question: Based on this schedule, what times is John available between 9:00 and 17:00? Please list the available time slots.\n    ```\n\n    The output of this verification step should be explicitly checked for consistency with the original schedule.\n\n3.  **Introduce a Time Interval Checker Function:** Implement a Python function that takes a list of busy times and a meeting duration as input and returns a list of available time slots of the specified duration. Use this function to pre-process schedule information before feeding it to the LLM.\n\n4.  **Develop Explicit Prioritization Logic with Step-By-Step Reasoning:** Explicitly add a prioritization step to prompt to ensure that identified solutions can be sorted based on the earliest availability.\n\n    *   **Identify all valid solution times.**\n    *   **Sort solutions based on earliest start time.**\n    *   **Reason about which solution is therefore the earliest.**\n5.  **Implement Limited Attempts**: Make sure that any iterative process includes a maximum attempt limiter.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the low accuracy and consistent errors, the capability trend is currently **stable but critically low**. Without significant intervention and the implementation of the suggested improvements, the system is unlikely to improve.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, the system's ability to interpret schedules accurately, generate valid solutions, and prioritize them based on preferences should significantly improve, leading to a higher accuracy and more reliable scheduling outcomes.\n"

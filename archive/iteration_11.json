  "approach_summary": "The script implements a multi-stage question answering system leveraging LLMs with a focus on enhanced question analysis and answer verification. It decomposes the problem into four main steps: question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. Each step utilizes the `call_llm` function with a specific prompt and system instruction to engage the LLM as an expert in different roles. The workflow starts with `main()` which calls `analyze_question()` to determine the question type and keywords, then `extract_relevant_passage()` to find relevant information. Subsequently, `generate_answer()` creates an answer based on the extracted passage and question analysis, and finally, `verify_answer()` checks the answer for correctness.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: The 1910 Chinese expedition to Tibet or the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1910 was a military campaign of the Qing dynasty to establish direct rule in Tibet in early 1910. The expedition occupied Lhasa on February 12 and officially deposed the 13th Dalai Lama on the 25th. Qing rule of Tibet was established in the early 18th century after the 1720 Chinese expedition to Tibet, but it was essentially a protectorate rather than a direct rule. The actual rule also waned considerably with the gradual weakening of the Qing dynasty in the 19th century. After the British expedition to Tibet in 1904 and the Sino-British treaty in 1906, the Qing decided to establish direct rule over Tibet and thus sent such an expedition in 1910. As Professor Dawa Norbu stated, \"The British military expedition and subsequent convention made the Chinese realize that their power in Tibet had disappeared. So, in 1910 China invaded Tibet, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.\" In the late winter of 1910, the Manchu government in Beijing was furious with the 13th Dalai Lama. His government, having witnessed the dissolution of its domains in Khams by Qing administrators, and fearing that the amban in Lhasa was going to eliminate its temporal authority, cut this imperial officer off from the sustenance that the Tibet government had guaranteed him in a prior agreement with the Qing court. When a relief column arrived in Lhasa from Sichuan to break the amban out of his isolation, the Dalai Lama fled for British India. However, the direct rule over Tibet proved short-lived: after the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution and the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1911-1912, Qing rule essentially ended in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet.

      "question": "PASSAGE: In September 1941, Partisans organized sabotage at the General Post Office in Zagreb.As the levels of resistance to its occupation grew, the Axis Powers responded with numerous minor offensives. There were also seven major Axis operations specifically aimed at eliminating all or most Yugoslav Partisan resistance. These major offensives were typically combined efforts by the German Wehrmacht and SS, Italy, Chetniks, the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbian collaborationist government, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The First Anti-Partisan Offensive was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the \"Republic of U\u017eice\", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards Bosnia. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility. After fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailovi\u0107, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs. This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailovi\u0107 advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the U\u017eice attack , but Britain continued to do so. On 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the 1st Proletarian Assault Brigade  - the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the \"Day of the Yugoslav People's Army\".\n\nQUESTION: How many months after Partisans organized sabotage at the General Post Office was Day of the Yugoslav People's Army?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: With a chance to clinch a playoff spot for the first time since 2002, the Raiders traveled to Kansas City for a crucial Thursday night matchup to determine the AFC West division lead. The Raiders needed a win and a Miami Dolphins loss or a win and a Denver Broncos loss to clinch a playoff berth. Oakland started well, recovering a muffed fumble by Tyreek Hill on a punt following their first drive and setting them up at the Kansas City 38-yard line. However, the Raiders had to settle for a field goal by Sebastian Janikowsi to take the early 3-0 lead. It would be the last lead the Raiders enjoyed on the night. Oakland's offense could muster little for most of the first half including after the Raider defense stopped KC on a fourth and one at the Oakland 27. The Chiefs took the lead early in the second quarter on a 36-yard pass from Alex Smith to Hill to make the score 7-3. After a four-and-out possession for the Raiders, the Chiefs again went down the field scoring on a Charcandrick West three-yard touchdown run. Following another Raiders short offensive possession, Hill returned a punt 78 yards for a touchdown to extend the Chief lead to 21-3. With six minutes remaining in the half, the Raiders went up-tempo and moved the ball down the field capping the drive with a one-yard touchdown run by Latavius Murray with 14 seconds remaining. At the half, the Raiders trailed 21-10. To begin the second half, the Raider defense stepped up intercepting Smith on the second play of the half and giving the offense the ball at the KC 23. However, the offense was shut down by the KC defense and settled for another Janikowski field goal, bringing them within a touchdown of the Chiefs at 21-13. On the next offensive play for the Chiefs, Khalil Mack sacked and stripped Smith of the ball and the Raiders recovered at the KC 18-yard line. The offense again managed little and was forced to settle for a field goal attempt. However, a bad snap resulted in Marquette King being tackled for three-yard loss. Both offenses mustered very little for the remainder of the game. With seven minutes left in the game, the Raiders needed a touchdown to tie and moved down to the KC 19-yard line, but were stopped on fourth down and the Chiefs ran the clock out. Derek Carr struggled mightily with his accuracy on the night, only completing 17 of his 41 pass attempts for 117 yards. He often missed open receivers or badly threw behind receivers. Carr admitted he had a bad night saying, \"Obviously, we didn't do enough.\" The loss ended the Raiders six-game win streak and gave the Chiefs the lead in the division with a 2-0 record over the Raiders.

The expedition occupied Lhasa on February 12 and officially deposed the 13th Dalai Lama on the 25th. Qing rule of Tibet was established in the early 18th century after the 1720 Chinese expedition to Tibet, but it was essentially a protectorate rather than a direct rule. The actual rule also waned considerably with the gradual weakening of the Qing dynasty in the 19th century. After the British expedition to Tibet in 1904 and the Sino-British treaty in 1906, the Qing decided to establish direct rule over Tibet and thus sent such an expedition in 1910. As Professor Dawa Norbu stated, \"The British military expedition and subsequent convention made the Chinese realize that their power in Tibet had disappeared. So, in 1910 China invaded Tibet, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.\" In the late winter of 1910, the Manchu government in Beijing was furious with the 13th Dalai Lama. His government, having witnessed the dissolution of its domains in Khams by Qing administrators, and fearing that the amban in Lhasa was going to eliminate its temporal authority, cut this imperial officer off from the sustenance that the Tibet government had guaranteed him in a prior agreement with the Qing court. When a relief column arrived in Lhasa from Sichuan to break the amban out of his isolation, the Dalai Lama fled for British India. However, the direct rule over Tibet proved short-lived: after the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution and the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1911-1912, Qing rule essentially ended in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet. All Qing forces left Tibet by the end of 1912.",

There were also seven major Axis operations specifically aimed at eliminating all or most Yugoslav Partisan resistance. These major offensives were typically combined efforts by the German Wehrmacht and SS, Italy, Chetniks, the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbian collaborationist government, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The First Anti-Partisan Offensive was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the \"Republic of U\u017eice\", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards Bosnia. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility. After fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailovi\u0107, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs. This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailovi\u0107 advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the U\u017eice attack , but Britain continued to do so. On 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the 1st Proletarian Assault Brigade  - the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the \"Day of the Yugoslav People's Army\".",

      "original_passage": "The Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689  were two military campaigns of the Tsardom of Russia against the Crimean Khanate. They were a part of the Russo-Turkish War  and Russo-Crimean Wars. These were the first Russian forces to come close to Crimea since 1569. They failed due to poor planning and the practical problem of moving such a large force across the steppe but nonetheless played a key role in halting the Ottoman expansion in Europe. The campaigns came as a surprise for the Ottoman leadership, spoiled its plans to invade Poland and Hungary and forced it to move significant forces from Europe to the east, which greatly helped the League in its struggle against the Ottomans. Having signed the Eternal Peace Treaty with Poland in 1686, Russia became a member of the anti-Turkish coalition , which was pushing the Turks south after their failure at Vienna in 1683 . Russia's role in 1687 was to send a force south to Perekop to bottle up the Crimeans inside their peninsula.",

      "original_passage": "With a chance to clinch a playoff spot for the first time since 2002, the Raiders traveled to Kansas City for a crucial Thursday night matchup to determine the AFC West division lead. The Raiders needed a win and a Miami Dolphins loss or a win and a Denver Broncos loss to clinch a playoff berth. Oakland started well, recovering a muffed fumble by Tyreek Hill on a punt following their first drive and setting them up at the Kansas City 38-yard line. However, the Raiders had to settle for a field goal by Sebastian Janikowsi to take the early 3-0 lead. It would be the last lead the Raiders enjoyed on the night. Oakland's offense could muster little for most of the first half including after the Raider defense stopped KC on a fourth and one at the Oakland 27. The Chiefs took the lead early in the second quarter on a 36-yard pass from Alex Smith to Hill to make the score 7-3. After a four-and-out possession for the Raiders, the Chiefs again went down the field scoring on a Charcandrick West three-yard touchdown run. Following another Raiders short offensive possession, Hill returned a punt 78 yards for a touchdown to extend the Chief lead to 21-3. With six minutes remaining in the half, the Raiders went up-tempo and moved the ball down the field capping the drive with a one-yard touchdown run by Latavius Murray with 14 seconds remaining. At the half, the Raiders trailed 21-10. To begin the second half, the Raider defense stepped up intercepting Smith on the second play of the half and giving the offense the ball at the KC 23. However, the offense was shut down by the KC defense and settled for another Janikowski field goal, bringing them within a touchdown of the Chiefs at 21-13. On the next offensive play for the Chiefs, Khalil Mack sacked and stripped Smith of the ball and the Raiders recovered at the KC 18-yard line. The offense again managed little and was forced to settle for a field goal attempt. However, a bad snap resulted in Marquette King being tackled for three-yard loss. Both offenses mustered very little for the remainder of the game. With seven minutes left in the game, the Raiders needed a touchdown to tie and moved down to the KC 19-yard line, but were stopped on fourth down and the Chiefs ran the clock out. Derek Carr struggled mightily with his accuracy on the night, only completing 17 of his 41 pass attempts for 117 yards. He often missed open receivers or badly threw behind receivers. Carr admitted he had a bad night saying, \"Obviously, we didn't do enough.\" The loss ended the Raiders six-game win streak and gave the Chiefs the lead in the division with a 2-0 record over the Raiders. The Raiders, still, in prime playoff position, would have to finish ahead of the Chiefs to win the division.",

      "original_passage": "On 12 April 1204, the weather conditions finally favoured the crusaders. A strong northern wind aided the Venetian ships in coming close to the walls, and after a short battle approximately seventy crusaders managed to enter the city. Some were able to knock holes in the walls, large enough for only a few knights at a time to crawl through; the Venetians were also successful at scaling the walls from the sea, though there was fighting with the Varangians. The Anglo-Saxon \"axe bearers\" had been amongst the most effective of the city's defenders, but they now attempted to negotiate higher wages from their Byzantine employers, before dispersing or surrendering. The crusaders captured the Blachernae section of the city in the northwest and used it as a base to attack the rest of the city. While attempting to defend themselves with a wall of fire, however, they burned even more of the city. This second fire left 15,000 people homeless. The crusaders completely took the city on 13 April. The crusaders sacked Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Byzantine works of art were stolen or ruined. Many of the civilian population of the city were killed and their property looted. Despite the threat of excommunication, the crusaders destroyed, defiled and looted the city's churches and monasteries. It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks. The Venetians received 150,000 silver marks that was their due, while the crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many crusader knights. Speros Vryonis in Byzantium and Europe gives a vivid account of the sack:",

It shows promise in information extraction, and attempts at reasoning, but struggles with accuracy, precision, and question interpretation. The accuracy of 70% suggests a functional, but unreliable system. The core capabilities it attempts to perform include:\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Pulling relevant facts from a source text.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning:** Performing basic arithmetic.\n*   **Question Answering:** Providing answers based on given information.\n*   **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Explaining its thought process.\n\nThe system's weakness in arithmetic is particularly concerning as it can negate the benefits of otherwise correct information extraction and reasoning. The execution output highlights a critical need for better understanding of the questions asked and generating answers that are not ambiguous.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Information Extraction (Potential):**  The system demonstrates the ability to extract data from text, when it understands the question being asked.\n*   **Structured Output:** Using \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags is excellent for automated parsing and evaluation.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Arithmetic Calculation:** This is the most pressing weakness.  A system that cannot perform basic calculations is severely limited.\n*   **Ambiguous Question Understanding:** The system frequently misinterprets the intent of the question, leading to irrelevant or incorrect answers.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Precision:** The system sometimes provides information that is too broad, not focused enough to directly answer the question.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe primary focus should be on **improving numerical reasoning, specifically arithmetic accuracy.** This is the most critical bottleneck preventing the system from achieving reliable performance. If the system cannot accurately compute, other strengths are diminished.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement Rigorous Unit Tests for Arithmetic Operations:**  Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests specifically designed to test addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division across various number types (integers, decimals, negative numbers). This is crucial.\n2.  **Implement Error Logging and Debugging for Arithmetic:**  When an arithmetic operation is performed, log the input values, the operation performed, and the result.  This will make it easier to identify the source of errors.\n3.  **Focus on Question Parsing with Examples:** Create a large dataset of question-answer pairs, focusing on the types of questions where the system currently struggles.  Use this dataset to train a more robust question parsing mechanism. You can use techniques like fine-tuning existing language models or employing semantic parsing.\n4. **Expand Sample Execution Outputs with Questions:** The current output snippets are useless without context. For every sample output you include, *always* include the original question. This is non-negotiable for effective analysis.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the limited data, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, the accuracy of 70% and the identified weaknesses suggest the system is currently at a **plateau or potentially declining** if the complexity of tasks is increasing without corresponding improvements in core capabilities. Addressing the numerical reasoning issues and improving question understanding are essential to reverse this trend.\n",

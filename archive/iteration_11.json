  "approach_summary": "The script addresses grid transformation tasks by decomposing the problem into data extraction, direct LLM transformation, and verification steps, aiming to improve accuracy using a strong prompting strategy with multiple examples in a single LLM call. It uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model, leveraging different system instructions for the data extractor, grid transformation expert, and grid transformation verifier roles. The `extract_data` function extracts training examples and test input, `apply_direct_transformation` applies the transformation using multi-example prompting, and `verify_transformation` verifies the result, returning the transformed grid if verification fails or if it succeeds. The `main` function orchestrates these steps sequentially, handling potential errors at each stage.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no explicit runtime errors (like JSONDecodeError or TypeError) reported in the provided 'output' fields. This suggests the errors are primarily in the reasoning and problem-solving logic rather than the code execution itself.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system demonstrates the ability to identify patterns in the training examples, as seen in the success case (sample\\_id 2) and in the description of the subgrid selection in the error case of sample_id 0.\n*   **Reasoning Explanation:** The system provides a clear explanation of its reasoning process, making it easier to understand why it arrived at a particular answer. This is evident in both the success and error cases.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Pattern Generalization:** While the system can identify patterns, it sometimes generalizes them incorrectly, leading to flawed solutions. The reliance on the largest value's location in sample\\_id 0 is a prime example of this.\n*   **Inability to execute correct identified patterns:** In sample_id 0, the system has identified the general pattern of the output being a subgrid, but is unable to correctly select the appropriate subgrid.\n*   **Lack of Numerical Precision:** The system struggles with accurately executing identified patterns. The system can identify a pattern, however it makes mistakes when implementing it in sample_id 0.\n*   **Ambiguity in Output Format:** In sample\\_id 1, the system provides a reasoning explanation instead of the transformed grid, indicating a potential issue with consistently producing the expected output format.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Flawed Pattern Generalization/Overfitting:** The system tends to overfit to specific details in the training examples, leading to incorrect generalizations when applied to new test inputs. The hypothesis in sample\\_id 0 regarding the \"largest value\" is a clear illustration of this issue.\n*   **Lack of Robust Pattern Identification:** The system relies on simple, easily-identified patterns, but struggles when the underlying transformation is more complex or requires a combination of multiple rules.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Subgrid Selection (Sample 0):** The system attempts to identify a subgrid pattern, but its method for selecting the subgrid's location is flawed and leads to an incorrect result.\n*   **Reasoning Output Instead of Grid (Sample 1):** The system focuses on describing the transformation process, failing to output the actual transformed grid as expected.\n*   **Inability to apply Numerical precision:** In sample_id 0, the identified pattern of a subgrid is correct, but numerical selection of the proper subgrid is wrong.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the system's **inability to generalize patterns robustly and execute patterns correctly.** It overfits to specific details in the training examples and struggles to identify and execute more complex transformations. This manifests as both incorrect pattern identification and inability to accurately execute patterns.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** Improve the system's ability to learn general rules from the training examples that are less sensitive to specific details.\n*   **Solution Generation:** Enhance the solution generation process to ensure it produces the expected output format consistently (i.e., the transformed grid).\n*   **Numerical Precision:** Improve numerical accuracy when extracting subgrids and implementing rules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a more robust pattern recognition algorithm:** Explore techniques like inductive logic programming or meta-learning to learn more generalizable rules from the training data.\n2.  **Introduce a \"pattern verification\" step:** Before applying a pattern to the test input, verify its consistency across all training examples and consider its plausibility based on general knowledge of grid transformations.\n3.  **Enforce Output Format:** Ensure the system always generates the output in the expected format (i.e., the transformed grid).

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and focused on concrete improvements.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal the following key issues:\n\n*   **Sample 0: Incorrect Subgrid Extraction & Generalization:** The system's attempt to link the subgrid's location to the largest value's position in the input grid is a flawed generalization. It correctly *identifies* the output as a subgrid, indicating partial competence, but its *execution* of selecting the correct subgrid is entirely incorrect. The reasoning is explicitly stated, making the source of the error clear: an unsubstantiated correlation.\n*   **Sample 1: Incorrect Output Format:** The system correctly identifies a *rule* (replacement of 3s based on row index), but fails to generate the transformed grid as output. It only provides a *reasoning explanation*. This points to a failure in the final output generation stage, likely a disconnect between the reasoning engine and the grid manipulation functions.  The failure demonstrates a critical issue: an inability to translate identified patterns into concrete output format.\n*   **Sample 2: Correct output** The system successfully identifies the horizontal spread pattern and correctly generates the expected output.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a limited capability for visual reasoning and pattern recognition on grid-based tasks. It can identify patterns and rules, but struggles with:\n\n*   **Robust Generalization:**  Prone to overfitting and drawing incorrect conclusions from limited examples.\n*   **Accurate Execution:**  Even when a pattern is correctly *identified*, its *implementation* can be flawed or entirely absent (missing output format).\n*   **Consistent Output Format:**  Fails to consistently produce the required grid-based output, sometimes providing reasoning explanations instead.\n\nThe system displays potential but suffers from fundamental issues in pattern generalization and implementation, resulting in a low accuracy score.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Identification:** The system can recognize patterns and rules in the input data, as evidenced by successful rule extraction and subgrid identification in the examples, even though the execution is often flawed.\n*   **Reasoning Explanation:** The system provides explanations for its reasoning process, which aids in debugging and understanding the system's decision-making. This is crucial for diagnosing and correcting errors.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Flawed Pattern Generalization & Execution:** The system's inability to generalize patterns correctly and consistently execute them is the primary bottleneck. It's prone to overfitting and drawing unsubstantiated correlations.\n*   **Inconsistent Output Generation:** Failure to consistently generate the expected grid-based output undermines the system's utility.  The system is not reliably producing the required outcome.\n*   **Lack of Numerical Precision:** When dealing with numbers, it is unable to accurately execute patterns.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Robust Pattern Generalization and Execution**. This encompasses both identifying *correct* patterns and reliably *implementing* them to generate the required output.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses and focus on improving pattern generalization and execution, implement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a \"Pattern Verification\" Module:**\n    *   **Description:** Before applying a derived pattern to a new input, this module should verify its consistency across *all* training examples. This involves testing the pattern against each training input and comparing the generated output with the expected output.\n    *   **Implementation:** Create a function that takes the pattern, training inputs, and corresponding expected outputs as input. The function applies the pattern to each training input and compares the result with the expected output. If inconsistencies are detected (e.g., generated output differs from expected output by more than a threshold), the pattern is flagged as unreliable.\n    *   **Rationale:** Prevents overfitting and ensures patterns are more generalizable. This can include basic sanity checks and plausibility assessments.\n2.  **Enforce Output Format with Post-Processing:**\n    *   **Description:** Add a post-processing step that guarantees the output is always a grid. If the reasoning engine produces text or a different format, this step will convert it into the expected grid structure.\n    *   **Implementation:** Implement a function that checks the output format. If it's not a grid, use regular expressions or other parsing techniques to extract the relevant grid information from the reasoning output. If a grid can't be extracted, return an empty grid or a predefined error grid.\n    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the issue of inconsistent output format, ensuring the system always produces a usable result.\n3.  **Implement improved debugging and logging:**\n    *   **Description:** Add more verbose logging of the execution process in order to identify errors during execution.\n    *   **Implementation:** Add print statements that show the inputs, operations, and outputs of each major step.\n    *   **Rationale:** Helps identify steps in execution that are prone to failure.\n4.  **Revise the pattern extraction to be more robust:**\n    *   **Description:** Update pattern identification to be more robust and improve numerical accuracy.\n    *   **Implementation:** Before drawing conclusions, verify that the mathematical solution is correct.\n    *   **Rationale:** Fixes numerical errors and increases the likelihood of a proper conclusion.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is currently **Stable but Low**. While the system exhibits some pattern recognition abilities, the significant issues with generalization and execution severely limit its overall effectiveness. The proposed improvements are aimed at shifting the trend towards **Improving** in the next iteration.\n",

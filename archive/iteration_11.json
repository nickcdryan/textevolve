  "approach_summary": "This script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by first extracting meeting details (participants, duration, available days, and schedules) and then finding an available time slot that satisfies all constraints. It decomposes the problem into two main steps: information extraction and time slot finding, each handled by separate LLM calls using a system instruction and examples. The script implicitly defines two agent roles: a meeting detail extractor and a meeting scheduler, to solve the task.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis report, and your instructions:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates very limited capability in solving scheduling problems. While the system is *designed* to handle complex scenarios, its practical performance is effectively zero due to a complete failure in information extraction.  The underlying algorithms are likely sound in principle, but the front-end parsing prevents the system from even beginning to apply them.  This is a critical failure that prevents the system from demonstrating any other capabilities. This assessment will focus almost entirely on remedying the information extraction problems, as no other assessment is possible with this glaring weakness.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The system is designed for a well-defined and potentially valuable problem (scheduling with multiple participants and constraints).\n*   **Error Detection:** The system correctly identifies its failure to extract information, which allows it to halt processing and report an error. This, however, is also the ONLY thing it manages to do.\n*   **Prompt Design**: There is evidence of decent prompt design. However, it appears that the prompt provided doesn't provide appropriate zero-shot or few-shot examples, and the responses are unparsable.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Extraction Failure:** The system's complete inability to reliably extract relevant information from input text renders the entire system useless. This is the dominant, show-stopping weakness.\n*   **Brittle Parsing Logic:**  The current implementation relies on inflexible parsing methods (likely regular expressions or simplistic string manipulation) that break down with minimal variations in input format or wording.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** The system cannot handle common variations in how users might express scheduling requests.\n*   **Error Message Granularity:** The error message is too generic (\"Could not extract meeting details\") and doesn't provide sufficient information for debugging.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Information Extraction**. This is *the* critical bottleneck. Without accurate information extraction, the system cannot function at all. All other potential improvements are irrelevant until this is resolved.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction (Prioritized Action):**\n    *   **Replace existing parsing with a dedicated LLM call using a detailed prompt for structured information extraction.** A good starting prompt would be:\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_info(text):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are a world-class meeting scheduler. Your job is to extract structured information from the following text to schedule a meeting.\n\n            Specifically, you need to extract the following information. Respond with a JSON object. If you cannot determine the value of a key, then respond with null.\n\n            - Participants: (A JSON array of participant names who need to attend the meeting. Each element in the array is a string.)\n            - Duration: (The length of the meeting in minutes. This MUST be an integer.)\n            - Available_Days: (A JSON array of strings containing the days of the week the meeting can take place on.)\n            - Available_Hours: (A JSON array containing the start and end datetimes for when the meeting can occur. Format the datetimes as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.)\n            - Each participant's blocked schedule: (A JSON object where the keys are participant names (strings) and the values are a JSON array of blocked datetimes (formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS').\n            \n\n            Here is the text to extract the data from: {text}\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(system=\"You are a helpful meeting scheduler. Extract data in JSON format.\", user=prompt)\n            try:\n                return json.loads(response)\n            except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n                return None\n        ```\n    *   **Thorough Testing:** Create a diverse set of test cases with variations in wording, formatting, and complexity. Manually review the LLM's output for each test case to identify failure points.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in the `call_llm` function to catch potential issues (e.g., network errors, invalid responses) and log them for debugging.  The `try...except` block in the example is a good start, but ensure the logging includes the original LLM response.\n\n2.  **Implement a Verification Agent (Secondary Action):**\n    *   After the information extraction, create a \"Verification Agent\" implemented as another LLM call.  This agent's sole purpose is to check the extracted information for consistency with the original text.\n    *   The prompt for the Verification Agent should include:\n        *   The original text.\n        *   The extracted JSON.\n        *   Specific questions to answer:\n            *   \"Is each participant name in the extracted JSON present in the original text?\"\n            *   \"Does the extracted duration seem reasonable given the context of the original text?\"\n            *   \"Do the extracted time constraints accurately reflect the constraints described in the original text?\"\n            *   \"Are there any contradictions between the extracted JSON and the original text?\"\n        *   Instructions to respond with a JSON object indicating pass/fail for each question, and a confidence score.\n    *   Based on the Verification Agent's output, take appropriate action:\n        *   If the verification fails with high confidence, flag the input for manual review.\n        *   If the verification fails with low confidence, re-run the information extraction step with a slightly modified prompt (e.g., add more examples, adjust the \"temperature\" setting of the LLM).\n\n3.  **Improve Error Reporting (Tertiary Action):**\n    *   Modify the error reporting to be more specific. Instead of a generic \"Could not extract meeting details,\" provide more context:\n        *   \"Failed to extract participant names.\"\n        *   \"Could not determine the meeting duration.\"\n        *   \"Inconsistent time constraints detected.\"\n    *   Include the relevant portion of the input text that caused the error in the error message. This makes debugging significantly easier.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Currently Declining (or at least Stable at Zero):** The system is not demonstrating any problem-solving capabilities. The trend is negative because the error analysis reveals a fundamental flaw that needs immediate attention. After the initial information extraction refactoring and validation, the system will likely show a very positive trend.\n\nThis comprehensive assessment provides a clear direction for the next iteration: **Fix the information extraction**. The provided recommendations are specific, actionable, and prioritized to address the critical weaknesses of the system. Focus on LLM-driven approaches, robust error handling, and detailed logging to build a more resilient and capable AI scheduling assistant.\n",

For example:\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_info(text):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            Extract the following information from the text:\n            - Participants: (list of names)\n            - Duration: (number in hours/minutes)\n            - Available hours: (start and end time)\n            - Day: (day of the week)\n            - Each participant's blocked schedule: (list of time intervals for each participant)\n\n            Text: {text}\n\n            Return the information as a JSON object. If a certain information is not present, return null value.\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n            return json.loads(response)\n        ```\n    *   **Implementation Notes**: Train the LLM with examples of varying input text formats to improve robustness. Include error handling in the `call_llm` function to gracefully handle cases where the LLM fails to return valid JSON. Add validation that ensures that the correct types are being extracted (e.g. datetime objects for times).\n2.  **Implement a Verification Agent for Extracted Information:**\n    *   After extracting the information, use another LLM call to verify its correctness.\n    *   The verification agent should compare the extracted information to the original text and identify any discrepancies.\n    *   If discrepancies are found, refine the extraction or flag the error for manual review.\n3.  **Improve Error Reporting:**\n    *   When the system fails to extract information, provide a more specific error message.\n    *   For example, instead of \"Could not extract meeting details,\" report \"Could not extract participant schedules\" or \"Could not determine meeting duration.\"\n    *   Include the relevant portion of the input text that caused the error to help with debugging.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 1**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 2**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 3**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 4**: information\\_extraction\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis report, and your instructions:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates very limited capability in solving scheduling problems. While the system is *designed* to handle complex scenarios, its practical performance is effectively zero due to a complete failure in information extraction.  The underlying algorithms are likely sound in principle, but the front-end parsing prevents the system from even beginning to apply them.  This is a critical failure that prevents the system from demonstrating any other capabilities. This assessment will focus almost entirely on remedying the information extraction problems, as no other assessment is possible with this glaring weakness.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The system is designed for a well-defined and potentially valuable problem (scheduling with multiple participants and constraints).\n*   **Error Detection:** The system correctly identifies its failure to extract information, which allows it to halt processing and report an error. This, however, is also the ONLY thing it manages to do.\n*   **Prompt Design**: There is evidence of decent prompt design. However, it appears that the prompt provided doesn't provide appropriate zero-shot or few-shot examples, and the responses are unparsable.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Extraction Failure:** The system's complete inability to reliably extract relevant information from input text renders the entire system useless. This is the dominant, show-stopping weakness.\n*   **Brittle Parsing Logic:**  The current implementation relies on inflexible parsing methods (likely regular expressions or simplistic string manipulation) that break down with minimal variations in input format or wording.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** The system cannot handle common variations in how users might express scheduling requests.\n*   **Error Message Granularity:** The error message is too generic (\"Could not extract meeting details\") and doesn't provide sufficient information for debugging.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Information Extraction**. This is *the* critical bottleneck. Without accurate information extraction, the system cannot function at all. All other potential improvements are irrelevant until this is resolved.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction (Prioritized Action):**\n    *   **Replace existing parsing with a dedicated LLM call using a detailed prompt for structured information extraction.** A good starting prompt would be:\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_info(text):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are a world-class meeting scheduler. Your job is to extract structured information from the following text to schedule a meeting.\n\n            Specifically, you need to extract the following information. Respond with a JSON object. If you cannot determine the value of a key, then respond with null.\n\n            - Participants: (A JSON array of participant names who need to attend the meeting. Each element in the array is a string.)\n            - Duration: (The length of the meeting in minutes. This MUST be an integer.)\n            - Available_Days: (A JSON array of strings containing the days of the week the meeting can take place on.)\n            - Available_Hours: (A JSON array containing the start and end datetimes for when the meeting can occur. Format the datetimes as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.)\n            - Each participant's blocked schedule: (A JSON object where the keys are participant names (strings) and the values are a JSON array of blocked datetimes (formatted as 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS').\n            \n\n            Here is the text to extract the data from: {text}\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(system=\"You are a helpful meeting scheduler. Extract data in JSON format.\", user=prompt)\n            try:\n                return json.loads(response)\n            except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n                return None\n        ```\n    *   **Thorough Testing:** Create a diverse set of test cases with variations in wording, formatting, and complexity. Manually review the LLM's output for each test case to identify failure points.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in the `call_llm` function to catch potential issues (e.g., network errors, invalid responses) and log them for debugging.  The `try...except` block in the example is a good start, but ensure the logging includes the original LLM response.\n\n2.  **Implement a Verification Agent (Secondary Action):**\n    *   After the information extraction, create a \"Verification Agent\" implemented as another LLM call.  This agent's sole purpose is to check the extracted information for consistency with the original text.\n    *   The prompt for the Verification Agent should include:\n        *   The original text.\n        *   The extracted JSON.\n        *   Specific questions to answer:\n            *   \"Is each participant name in the extracted JSON present in the original text?\"\n            *   \"Does the extracted duration seem reasonable given the context of the original text?\"\n            *   \"Do the extracted time constraints accurately reflect the constraints described in the original text?\"\n            *   \"Are there any contradictions between the extracted JSON and the original text?\"\n        *   Instructions to respond with a JSON object indicating pass/fail for each question, and a confidence score.\n    *   Based on the Verification Agent's output, take appropriate action:\n        *   If the verification fails with high confidence, flag the input for manual review.\n        *   If the verification fails with low confidence, re-run the information extraction step with a slightly modified prompt (e.g., add more examples, adjust the \"temperature\" setting of the LLM).\n\n3.  **Improve Error Reporting (Tertiary Action):**\n    *   Modify the error reporting to be more specific. Instead of a generic \"Could not extract meeting details,\" provide more context:\n        *   \"Failed to extract participant names.\"\n        *   \"Could not determine the meeting duration.\"\n        *   \"Inconsistent time constraints detected.\"\n    *   Include the relevant portion of the input text that caused the error in the error message. This makes debugging significantly easier.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Currently Declining (or at least Stable at Zero):** The system is not demonstrating any problem-solving capabilities. The trend is negative because the error analysis reveals a fundamental flaw that needs immediate attention. After the initial information extraction refactoring and validation, the system will likely show a very positive trend.\n\nThis comprehensive assessment provides a clear direction for the next iteration: **Fix the information extraction**. The provided recommendations are specific, actionable, and prioritized to address the critical weaknesses of the system. Focus on LLM-driven approaches, robust error handling, and detailed logging to build a more resilient and capable AI scheduling assistant.\n"

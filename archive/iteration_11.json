  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using an LLM to analyze coordinate patterns and apply transformations. It decomposes the problem into analyzing patterns and applying the deduced transformation rule. The LLM acts as an expert in identifying grid transformation patterns based on coordinate analysis, with `call_llm` used to interact with the LLM.\n\nThe main function, `main`, calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which calls `call_llm` twice: first to analyze the grid transformation (`coordinate_analysis_prompt`) and second to apply the transformation (`transformation_application_prompt`). The overall workflow involves analyzing the input-output grid examples using the LLM, then applying the identified transformation rule to generate the final grid, with validation to check formatting.",

However, the specific placement and values are incorrect compared to the expected output (not provided, but inferred from the failure).\n*   **Sample 1:** The system appears to identify a block of repeating numbers (8s, 3s), but incorrectly places and orients them.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system inserts numbers (5, 2) in seemingly arbitrary locations.  There is no clear relationship to any training input.\n\nThere is no obvious evidence of runtime errors like `JSONDecodeError` or `TypeError`. The code executes, but the *logic* is flawed. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest proper output formatting.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates very limited capabilities.  While it can represent grids and perform basic manipulations, it fundamentally fails at:\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Generalization:** Unable to accurately identify and apply transformation patterns from training examples to new inputs.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Poor understanding of spatial relationships and dependencies within the grid.\n*   **Constraint Adherence:** No clear adherence to implicit constraints in the tasks.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Grid Representation:** Correctly represents grid data structures as nested lists.\n*   **Basic Manipulation:** Can modify the grid, even if incorrectly.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Produces output in the required format (with \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\").\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The most critical weakness. The system cannot reliably extrapolate patterns from training examples to new data.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Lacks the ability to understand how changes in one part of the grid affect other parts.\n*   **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation logic is fundamentally flawed.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. Without this, the system cannot solve any non-trivial problems.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. **Implement Reasoning Traceability:**  Add `print` statements to the code to track the pattern extraction and transformation application process. This will help identify exactly where the reasoning fails. Print intermediate states of the grid during the transformation process.\n2. **Simplify the Pattern Extraction Algorithm:** Instead of trying to learn complex patterns, start with simpler heuristics. For example, look for consistent relationships between *adjacent* cells in the training data (e.g., \"if cell (x, y) is X, then cell (x+1, y) becomes Y\").\n3.  **Implement a Simple Transformation Rule Representation:** Introduce a data structure to represent transformation rules explicitly.  This could be as simple as a dictionary mapping input patterns to output patterns (e.g., `{(0, 0, 0): 5}` means \"if the three cells are all 0, replace them with 5\").\n4. **Evaluate on Minimal Working Examples:** Create a set of very simple tasks to test the pattern extraction and transformation logic in isolation.  Focus on getting these working correctly before attempting more complex problems.\n5.  **Debugging & Monitoring:** The system needs better instrumentation to examine intermediate outputs and internal states.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the 0% accuracy, the capability trend is **stable, but abysmal**. There is no evidence of improvement. The system requires significant architectural and algorithmic changes to show any progress.\n",

For instance, use formal logic or rule-based systems.\n4. **Augment the training data:** Generate synthetic training examples that cover a wider range of grid structures and transformations to improve the system's robustness.\n5. **Debugging & Monitoring:** Include logging, intermediate outputs, and visualization tools to better understand the internal state of the system and identify failure points.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n* **Sample ID 0:**\n    * Failed Capabilities: pattern_generalization, spatial_reasoning, constraint_handling\n* **Sample ID 1:**\n    * Failed Capabilities: pattern_generalization, spatial_reasoning, constraint_handling\n* **Sample ID 2:**\n    * Failed Capabilities: pattern_generalization, spatial_reasoning, constraint_handling\n\n### SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS\n(Copied from the provided input)\n```\n[\n  \"ANSWER_START\\n```python\\n[\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\\n  [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n]\\n```\\nANSWER_END\\n\",\n  \"ANSWER_START\\n```python\\n[\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0],\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0]\\n]\\n```\\nANSWER_END\\n\",\n  \"ANSWER_START\\n```\\n[\\n  [5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0]\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\\n  [2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\\n]\\n```\\nANSWER_END\\n\"\n]\n```\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nBased on the provided outputs, the system consistently fails to solve the provided tasks.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system seems to be attempting to transfer patterns of connected numbers.  However, the specific placement and values are incorrect compared to the expected output (not provided, but inferred from the failure).\n*   **Sample 1:** The system appears to identify a block of repeating numbers (8s, 3s), but incorrectly places and orients them.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system inserts numbers (5, 2) in seemingly arbitrary locations.  There is no clear relationship to any training input.\n\nThere is no obvious evidence of runtime errors like `JSONDecodeError` or `TypeError`. The code executes, but the *logic* is flawed. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest proper output formatting.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates very limited capabilities.  While it can represent grids and perform basic manipulations, it fundamentally fails at:\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Generalization:** Unable to accurately identify and apply transformation patterns from training examples to new inputs.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Poor understanding of spatial relationships and dependencies within the grid.\n*   **Constraint Adherence:** No clear adherence to implicit constraints in the tasks.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Grid Representation:** Correctly represents grid data structures as nested lists.\n*   **Basic Manipulation:** Can modify the grid, even if incorrectly.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Produces output in the required format (with \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\").\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The most critical weakness. The system cannot reliably extrapolate patterns from training examples to new data.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Lacks the ability to understand how changes in one part of the grid affect other parts.\n*   **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation logic is fundamentally flawed.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. Without this, the system cannot solve any non-trivial problems.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. **Implement Reasoning Traceability:**  Add `print` statements to the code to track the pattern extraction and transformation application process. This will help identify exactly where the reasoning fails. Print intermediate states of the grid during the transformation process.\n2. **Simplify the Pattern Extraction Algorithm:** Instead of trying to learn complex patterns, start with simpler heuristics. For example, look for consistent relationships between *adjacent* cells in the training data (e.g., \"if cell (x, y) is X, then cell (x+1, y) becomes Y\").\n3.  **Implement a Simple Transformation Rule Representation:** Introduce a data structure to represent transformation rules explicitly.  This could be as simple as a dictionary mapping input patterns to output patterns (e.g., `{(0, 0, 0): 5}` means \"if the three cells are all 0, replace them with 5\").\n4. **Evaluate on Minimal Working Examples:** Create a set of very simple tasks to test the pattern extraction and transformation logic in isolation.  Focus on getting these working correctly before attempting more complex problems.\n5.  **Debugging & Monitoring:** The system needs better instrumentation to examine intermediate outputs and internal states.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the 0% accuracy, the capability trend is **stable, but abysmal**. There is no evidence of improvement. The system requires significant architectural and algorithmic changes to show any progress.\n"

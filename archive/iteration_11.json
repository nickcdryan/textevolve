  "approach_summary": "This script solves grid transformation problems by using an LLM in a multi-stage process. First, it extracts training examples and a test input grid from a given question using regular expressions in `preprocess_question`. It then uses `generate_transformation_rule` to generate a transformation rule from the training examples by prompting the LLM, acting as a transformation rule generator. Next, `apply_transformation_rule` applies this rule to the test input by prompting the LLM, which acts as a grid transformation expert, to produce the transformed grid. Finally, `post_process_grid` formats the output to ensure it is well-formed.\n\nThe functions used are `main`, `preprocess_question`, `generate_transformation_rule`, `apply_transformation_rule`, `post_process_grid`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow: It calls `preprocess_question` to parse the input, `generate_transformation_rule` to get the transformation rule, `apply_transformation_rule` to transform the test input, and `post_process_grid` to format the final output. Both `generate_transformation_rule` and `apply_transformation_rule` use `call_llm` to interact with the LLM.",

This indicates a complete failure to extract any useful transformation logic from the training examples. The model seems to have defaulted to a zero-filled grid.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system attempts to identify a transformation rule based on the first and last rows of the grid. While the system is successful in generating and executing valid Python code, the transformation logic is incorrect. The system only modifies rows between the first and last, replacing \"3\" with the first element of the first row. This is a misunderstanding of the required transformation.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system accurately describes the transformation rule (nearest non-zero value propagation). However, the code has issues. The code uses the original `row` during backward propagation instead of the `transformed_row`, mitigating an edge case but also leading to the wrong results. The forward and backward propagation logic is also flawed resulting in many of the values that should've been unchanged to be changed.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of the problem statement by generating Python code and attempting to implement the grid transformations. However, it struggles significantly with accurately extracting the correct transformation logic from the training examples and translating this understanding into correct code. The performance is poor, with an accuracy of 0%. There is an over-reliance on code generation, often failing to translate conceptual understanding of the rules into functional code.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can generate syntactically correct Python code.\n*   **Problem Understanding:** The system can often understand the task description and constraints provided.\n*   **Copying the Grid:** The system reliably copies the input grid, which is good practice to avoid unintended side effects.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system consistently fails to accurately identify and generalize transformation patterns from the provided examples.\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Logic:** The generated code implements incorrect transformation logic, leading to erroneous results.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system struggles to identify and enforce constraints on which rows/columns should be modified.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Lacks any mechanism to verify the correctness of the generated solution before outputting it.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **improving Pattern Recognition** to correctly extract transformation rules from training examples.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Introduce a Rule Extraction Phase:** Before generating code, force the system to explicitly state the transformation rules it has identified from the examples. This rule should be in a structured, easily verifiable format (e.g., if X then Y).\n2.  **Implement Example-Based Rule Verification:** After the rule extraction phase, the system must check the extracted rules against the training examples to ensure consistency. This can be done by simulating the transformation using the extracted rule and comparing the output to the expected output from the training examples.\n3.  **Add Intermediate Output for Debugging:** Add print statements and intermediate outputs within the generated code. This will aid in tracing the execution flow and pinpointing the source of errors.\n4.  **Refine Code Generation based on Extracted Rules:** Ensure the generated code *directly* reflects the extracted rules. Avoid ad-hoc logic that deviates from the established pattern.\n5.  **Implement Unit Tests:** Create a suite of unit tests to verify the generated code against known input-output pairs.\n6. **Use more specific terminology in the prompt instructions**: Prompting with terminology like \"extract a rule\" will encourage the AI to perform this step explicitly, rather than implicitly within the code generation step.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the provided data, the capabilities are **stable (and low)**. The system consistently fails to accurately apply the transformations, suggesting no improvement in pattern recognition or problem-solving abilities between samples.\n\nBy prioritizing pattern recognition, rule verification, and explicit reasoning, the system can move towards more reliable and accurate performance on grid transformation tasks.\n",

This results in incorrect transformations applied to the test input, stemming from flawed reasoning and faulty code generation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system needs a better mechanism for identifying and encoding patterns from the training examples.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** Improve the system's ability to identify and apply constraints related to which rows or columns should be transformed.\n3.  **Solution Verification:** Implement a more robust solution verification process to identify and correct errors in the transformed grid before outputting the final answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Abstract Pattern Representation:** Develop a more abstract representation of the grid transformation pattern, rather than relying solely on code. This could involve symbolic representations or rule-based systems.\n2.  **Constraint-Based Reasoning:** Incorporate constraint-based reasoning to explicitly model the restrictions on which rows or columns can be transformed.\n3.  **Example-Based Verification:** Use the training examples to verify the generated solution. Compare the transformed test input with the training examples to identify inconsistencies or errors.\n4.  **Refine Code Generation Logic:** If relying on code generation, ensure that the generated code accurately reflects the identified pattern and constraints. Add more robust unit tests to ensure the code behaves as expected.\n5. **Add Explicit Reasoning Steps**: Add print statements and intermediate outputs to the generated code to help trace the execution and diagnose the source of errors.\n6. **Prioritize Conceptual Understanding:** Encourage a phase where the reasoning system first explicitly states the rules derived from the examples, then checks against the examples, *before* generating code.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Likely correct\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed\n    *   solution_generation: Failed\n    *   solution_verification: Failed\n    *   decision_making: Failed\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Likely correct\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed\n    *   solution_generation: Failed\n    *   solution_verification: Failed\n    *   decision_making: Failed\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Correct\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed\n    *   solution_generation: Failed\n    *   solution_verification: Failed\n    *   decision_making: Failed\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The generated output is a grid containing only zeros, regardless of the input. This indicates a complete failure to extract any useful transformation logic from the training examples. The model seems to have defaulted to a zero-filled grid.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system attempts to identify a transformation rule based on the first and last rows of the grid. While the system is successful in generating and executing valid Python code, the transformation logic is incorrect. The system only modifies rows between the first and last, replacing \"3\" with the first element of the first row. This is a misunderstanding of the required transformation.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system accurately describes the transformation rule (nearest non-zero value propagation). However, the code has issues. The code uses the original `row` during backward propagation instead of the `transformed_row`, mitigating an edge case but also leading to the wrong results. The forward and backward propagation logic is also flawed resulting in many of the values that should've been unchanged to be changed.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of the problem statement by generating Python code and attempting to implement the grid transformations. However, it struggles significantly with accurately extracting the correct transformation logic from the training examples and translating this understanding into correct code. The performance is poor, with an accuracy of 0%. There is an over-reliance on code generation, often failing to translate conceptual understanding of the rules into functional code.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can generate syntactically correct Python code.\n*   **Problem Understanding:** The system can often understand the task description and constraints provided.\n*   **Copying the Grid:** The system reliably copies the input grid, which is good practice to avoid unintended side effects.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system consistently fails to accurately identify and generalize transformation patterns from the provided examples.\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Logic:** The generated code implements incorrect transformation logic, leading to erroneous results.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system struggles to identify and enforce constraints on which rows/columns should be modified.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Lacks any mechanism to verify the correctness of the generated solution before outputting it.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **improving Pattern Recognition** to correctly extract transformation rules from training examples.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Introduce a Rule Extraction Phase:** Before generating code, force the system to explicitly state the transformation rules it has identified from the examples. This rule should be in a structured, easily verifiable format (e.g., if X then Y).\n2.  **Implement Example-Based Rule Verification:** After the rule extraction phase, the system must check the extracted rules against the training examples to ensure consistency. This can be done by simulating the transformation using the extracted rule and comparing the output to the expected output from the training examples.\n3.  **Add Intermediate Output for Debugging:** Add print statements and intermediate outputs within the generated code. This will aid in tracing the execution flow and pinpointing the source of errors.\n4.  **Refine Code Generation based on Extracted Rules:** Ensure the generated code *directly* reflects the extracted rules. Avoid ad-hoc logic that deviates from the established pattern.\n5.  **Implement Unit Tests:** Create a suite of unit tests to verify the generated code against known input-output pairs.\n6. **Use more specific terminology in the prompt instructions**: Prompting with terminology like \"extract a rule\" will encourage the AI to perform this step explicitly, rather than implicitly within the code generation step.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the provided data, the capabilities are **stable (and low)**. The system consistently fails to accurately apply the transformations, suggesting no improvement in pattern recognition or problem-solving abilities between samples.\n\nBy prioritizing pattern recognition, rule verification, and explicit reasoning, the system can move towards more reliable and accurate performance on grid transformation tasks.\n"

Is the data source available?  Check file paths, database connections, API endpoints, etc.  If the iteration depends on data from a prior step (e.g., a refined dataset), verify that the prior step completed successfully and produced the expected output.\n    *   **Recommendation 1b:**  If there's a sampling mechanism (e.g., randomly selecting examples for the iteration), verify its logic and ensure it's not returning an empty set. Add logging around the sampling function to confirm the data source and sample size. Log the shape and a few example records from the input data.\n    *   **Recommendation 1c:** Check for data validation errors. Is the program crashing during data loading due to unexpected data types or formats?  Add robust error handling around the data loading step, logging specific error messages.\n*   **Hypothesis 2: Task Queue/Orchestration Issue:**\n    *   **Recommendation 2a:** Verify that the task queue (if used) is functioning correctly. Are tasks being enqueued properly? Are workers available to process them? Are there any messages in the task queue indicating errors?  If using Celery or similar, check the worker logs for errors.\n    *   **Recommendation 2b:** If there's an orchestration layer (e.g., using a workflow management system like Airflow or Prefect), review the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) or workflow definition. Are the dependencies correctly specified?  Is the relevant task even being triggered? Look for skipped tasks or failed dependencies.\n*   **Hypothesis 3: Resource Constraints:**\n    *   **Recommendation 3a:**  Check resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk space).  Is the system running out of resources, causing the process to be killed or hang?  Monitor resource usage during the iteration.\n    *   **Recommendation 3b:**  If using external services (e.g., API calls), check rate limits.  Is the program being throttled? Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to handle rate limiting. Log request statuses.\n*   **Hypothesis 4: Code Bug Preventing Execution:**\n    *   **Recommendation 4a:** Review the code responsible for initiating the iteration and processing samples. Look for any conditional statements or loops that might be preventing execution from starting. Add debugging statements (e.g., `print` statements or use a debugger) to trace the execution flow.  Specifically, put a print statement *right before* the loop that is supposed to iterate through the samples.\n    *   **Recommendation 4b:** Check for unhandled exceptions that might be crashing the process before it can start processing samples.

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using a multi-agent approach with context-based reasoning. It decomposes the problem into context identification, relevant example selection, transformation application, and verification, each handled by a specialized LLM agent. The agents use chain-of-thought prompting to generate intermediate reasoning steps. The main function orchestrates calls to `identify_context`, `select_relevant_examples`, `apply_transformation`, and `verify_grid` to process the input question and produce the final transformed grid.",

Small variations or edge cases in the input data lead to misapplication of the transformation rule.\n2.  **Generalization of Transformations:** The system's inability to completely understand the underlying relationships and rules driving the transformations is hindering generalization.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect value placement:** The most common error pattern is placing a non-zero number where it should be zero (or vice-versa) in the output grid. This indicates a flaw in understanding the precise mapping rules.\n*   **Misinterpretation of the transformation rule**: In Sample 1 the pattern of reducing grid size, and correctly pulling out specific values is almost there, however the 0 values are incorrect.\n*   **Difficulty handling boundaries/edges:** The system sometimes struggles to appropriately transform data near the boundaries of the input grid.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's failure to accurately and consistently generalize transformation rules learned from the training examples to the test input. The model fails to apply what it learns, leading to specific errors in value placement.

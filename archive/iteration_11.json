  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using two LLM-powered agents: `extract_meeting_info` extracts the details of a meeting from the input question and then validates the extracted data, and `schedule_meeting` proposes a meeting time based on the extracted information and also validates that the proposed time is correctly formatted. Both functions use few-shot examples in their prompts and incorporate a retry mechanism. `extract_meeting_info` uses `call_llm` to extract the meeting information and validates the extracted info; `schedule_meeting` uses `call_llm` to generate a proposed meeting time, which is then verified using regex pattern matching. Finally, the `main` function orchestrates the workflow by first calling `extract_meeting_info` to pull out the meeting details and then calling `schedule_meeting` to schedule the time.",

If the output isn't parsable, the system can't proceed, even if it has reasoned correctly.\n2.  **Reliable Constraint Satisfaction:** Consistently finding times that satisfy all constraints is the core task. The fact that the system fails in multiple instances even when a golden answer demonstrates a possible solution is a significant problem.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **\"Incorrect Format\" Errors:** A consistent inability to format the output correctly, causing scheduling failures. This is especially prominent when multiple attempts are made.\n*   **Scheduling Failures Despite Possible Solutions:** Multiple error cases show the system reporting \"Scheduling failed\" even though a valid solution exists (as indicated by the golden answer).\n*   **Incorrect Time and Day Selection:** Sample 1 and 4 show that the LLM suggests wrong times/days that don't meet the scheduling requirements.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inability to generate consistently well-formatted, parsable output AND the LLM's failure to correctly reason about and satisfy all the constraints** simultaneously. The \"Incorrect format\" error is the first roadblock, but the constraint violations are equally significant and demonstrate a deeper reasoning flaw.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting:**\n    *   **Robust Output Verification and Correction:** Implement robust output verification that specifically checks for the expected format *after* the LLM generates its answer. If the format is wrong, have a feedback loop that provides specific formatting instructions back to the LLM to regenerate the output. This could involve a \"verification agent\".\n    *   **Few-Shot Examples with Explicit Formatting:** Provide the LLM with multiple few-shot examples that *explicitly* demonstrate the expected output format. Use distinct examples and formatting styles (e.g. \"Monday, 9:00-9:30\", \"Monday, 9:00 - 9:30\", etc.)\n\n2.  **Constraint Handling:**\n    *   **Explicit Constraint Listing and Verification:** Before attempting to generate a solution, have the LLM explicitly list all the constraints (participant availability, time range, day preferences, etc.). *Then*, after generating a solution, have it explicitly verify that the solution satisfies *each* constraint. This should be done in a chain-of-thought manner.\n    *   **Decomposition of Scheduling Task:** Break down the scheduling task into smaller more manageable subtasks.\n    *   **Iterative Refinement with Constraint Feedback:** If a proposed solution violates a constraint, provide *specific* feedback to the LLM about the violated constraint and ask it to refine the solution to address the violation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a \"Formatting Agent\":** Create a specialized agent whose sole responsibility is to take the LLM's scheduling suggestion and reformat it into the required output structure. This agent would have very specific instructions and examples focused on formatting.\n\n2.  **Use a Verification Chain-of-Thought Approach:** Implement a chain-of-thought process *after* a solution is generated where the LLM explicitly reasons through whether the solution satisfies each constraint. For example:\n    \"Let's check if this time works for everyone:\\n- Does it work for Noah? (Check Noah's schedule). Yes.\\n- Does it work for Ralph? (Check Ralph's schedule). Yes.\\n- ...\\nTherefore, this solution is valid.\"\n\n3.  **Increase Few-Shot Examples:** Include more diverse few-shot examples in the prompt, specifically demonstrating cases with multiple participants, constraints, and day/time preferences. Vary the formatting of the solution in the examples.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Task for Initial Iterations:** Start with a simplified version of the scheduling problem (e.g., fewer participants, fewer constraints) to make it easier to identify and fix the core issues before scaling up the complexity.\n\n5.  **Input Validation:** Add checks to validate the structure and content of the input question before processing to catch inconsistencies that could confuse the system.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making, information_extraction (possibly), formatting\n*   **Sample 1:** constraint_handling, decision_making\n*   **Sample 2:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making, information_extraction (possibly), formatting\n*   **Sample 3:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making, information_extraction (possibly), formatting\n*   **Sample 4:** constraint_handling, decision_making\n",

Samples 0, 2, and 3 show a repeating pattern of \"Scheduling failed (attempt X): Incorrect format\". This indicates the system is struggling to consistently generate output in the expected format required for downstream parsing. The second sample showing a proposed time may be in the correct format, but the accuracy is unknown.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of the scheduling problem and the general constraints involved. However, it exhibits significant deficiencies in generating correctly formatted output and reliably satisfying scheduling constraints. The primary capability gap is the *reliable* generation of parsable and correct scheduling solutions.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Understanding:** The system appears to grasp the core nature of scheduling tasks and the need to coordinate between participants.\n*   **Potential Constraint Awareness:** The system attempts scheduling, suggesting it knows there are rules.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inconsistent Output Formatting:** A significant number of errors are attributed to \"Incorrect format,\" which severely hinders the system's ability to produce valid scheduling solutions.

After the LLM proposes a solution, the Formatting Agent validates the output format. If incorrect, it provides *specific* formatting instructions back to the LLM for regeneration.\n    ```python\n    def format_agent(llm_output, expected_format):\n      if is_valid_format(llm_output, expected_format):\n        return llm_output\n      else:\n        feedback = generate_format_feedback(llm_output, expected_format)\n        return feedback # Feed this back to LLM as guidance\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement Constraint Satisfaction Verification Chain:** After the LLM generates the candidate, it creates a chain of thought to verify that all constraints are satisfied. The format will be standardized.\n\n3.  **Increase Few-Shot Examples (with diverse formatting):** Add more few-shot examples to the prompt. *Crucially*, vary the formatting of the solution in the examples (e.g., \"Mon, 10:00 - 10:30\", \"Monday 10:00am-10:30am\", \"Monday, 10:00 to 10:30\"). This will make the system more robust to format variations.\n\n4.  **Constraint Prioritization and Early Pruning:** Modify the scheduling logic to prioritize the most restrictive constraints first. This can help prune the search space early and prevent the system from wasting time exploring infeasible solutions.\n    ```python\n    def prioritize_constraints(constraints):\n      # Sort constraints by restrictiveness (e.g., fewer available slots)\n      return sorted(constraints, key=lambda c: c.restrictiveness_score, reverse=True)\n    ```\n\n5.  **Implement Input Validation**: Add code to pre-process the prompt to ensure that it's internally consistent. Check that all required information is present before the LLM starts the scheduling process.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level.** There's no evidence of improvement, as the system consistently fails to format the output correctly and satisfy all constraints. The system needs significant improvement to get to 100% accuracy.\n",

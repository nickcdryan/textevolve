  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by first analyzing visual features using an LLM, then applying the derived transformation. The problem is decomposed into `analyze_visual_features` and `apply_transformation`. There are two LLM agent roles: one for feature analysis and another for applying transformations.\n\n*   `solve_grid_transformation`: Orchestrates the solution by calling `analyze_visual_features` and `apply_transformation`.\n*   `analyze_visual_features`: Analyzes the problem and returns a transformation description. It uses `call_llm` to get the transformation description and a validation of the description.\n*   `apply_transformation`: Applies the transformation from `analyze_visual_features` to the test grid using `call_llm`.\n*   `call_llm`: Makes calls to the Gemini LLM, handling both prompts and system instructions.\n\nThe overall workflow involves analyzing the visual features of the input using an LLM, validating the LLM response, and then applying the described transformation to generate the output grid, again using an LLM.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and improvement suggestions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several key observations:\n\n*   **Inconsistent Transformation Application:** The errors cases demonstrate failures in accurately applying transformations learned from training examples to test grids. The system appears to struggle with complex or overlapping patterns.\n*   **Constraint Violations:** The system sometimes fills cells that should remain empty, indicating a failure to adhere to constraints implicitly present in the training data.\n*   **Code Generation vs. Execution Errors:** One execution output includes the generated code.  This allows us to differentiate between code generation errors and execution errors.  The code *appears* logically sound at first glance, but when executed, the pattern recognition or parameter setting within the code fails to generalize. The system needs improvements to its reasoning about the constraints and relationships that the input-output examples are conveying.\n*   **Output Formatting:** While not the primary issue here, inconsistencies in output formatting are present, specifically related to code blocks and brackets.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system shows promise in understanding grid transformations, generating code to implement these transformations, and executing the code. However, its ability to *accurately* generalize learned patterns to unseen inputs is severely limited.  The system understands programming concepts, but the core AI component \u2013 pattern recognition and application \u2013 requires significant improvement. The system is able to generate code and execute it. But the code that it generates may not correctly represent the patterns in the training data.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation and Execution:** The system can generate and execute code to perform grid transformations. This foundational capability is essential for the system's overall functionality. The system isn't just \"memorizing\" outputs; it attempts to solve the problem algorithmically.\n*   **Pattern Identification (Basic):** The system demonstrates a *basic* ability to identify patterns. The successful case confirms that it can handle simple transformations.\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** The system decomposes the problem into stages: understanding the pattern, writing code, executing the code, and generating the output.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The most critical weakness is the system's inability to generalize transformation patterns effectively from training examples to test inputs. It appears to overfit to the training data or fails to identify the essential features that define the transformation.\n*   **Complex Pattern Handling:** The system struggles with complex or overlapping patterns within the grid transformations. It may be overwhelmed by multiple transformations happening simultaneously.\n*   **Constraint Awareness:** The system's ability to recognize and apply constraints inherent in the grid transformations is lacking. This results in outputs that violate the underlying rules of the transformation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**.  Without accurate generalization, the system's other capabilities (code generation, execution) are rendered largely ineffective.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis, here are specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a Weighted Pattern Recognition Algorithm:**\n    *   **Details:** Instead of treating all patterns learned from training examples equally, introduce a mechanism to assign weights based on frequency, complexity, and relevance to the input.  This could involve a scoring system based on how many times a pattern appears or how consistently it applies across the training set.\n    *   **Rationale:** This helps the system prioritize the most important and reliable transformation rules.\n    *   **Implementation Steps:**\n        *   Modify the pattern recognition module to assign weights to identified patterns.\n        *   When generating the output, use the weights to influence the application of different patterns.  Higher-weighted patterns should have a stronger influence.\n        *   Experiment with different weighting schemes (e.g., frequency-based, complexity-based, confidence-based).\n\n2.  **Introduce Explicit Constraint Encoding:**\n    *   **Details:** Augment the system with a module dedicated to explicitly encoding constraints based on the training examples.  This could involve identifying rules like \"if cell X is non-zero, then cell Y must also be non-zero\" or \"a cell's value can only spread horizontally, not vertically.\"\n    *   **Rationale:** By explicitly representing constraints, the system can avoid generating outputs that violate these rules.\n    *   **Implementation Steps:**\n        *   Develop a constraint learning module that analyzes the training data and extracts implicit constraints.\n        *   Integrate a constraint satisfaction solver into the code generation process. Before generating the final output, ensure that the generated grid satisfies all identified constraints.\n\n3.  **Refine Feature Extraction:**\n    *   **Details:** Re-evaluate the features that the system uses to identify patterns.  Consider more sophisticated features that capture relationships between cells, symmetry, or other relevant aspects of the grid.\n    *   **Rationale:** Better feature extraction will allow the system to learn more robust and generalizable patterns.\n    *   **Implementation Steps:**\n        *   Explore using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other deep learning techniques to automatically learn relevant features.  Even if not fully implementing a CNN, analyze the types of features these networks learn from image data and adapt them to the grid transformation problem.\n        *   Experiment with hand-crafted features that capture specific grid characteristics.\n\n4. **Expand the Training Data and Data Augmentation:**\n    *   **Details:** Increase the volume of training data. Also, implement data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the diversity of training examples, such as rotations, reflections, and translations of existing grids.\n    *   **Rationale:** More data and more diverse data will lead to better generalization.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **Stable, with high potential for Improvement**. The system has foundational capabilities (code generation, basic pattern recognition), but it is currently underperforming due to poor generalization. The actionable recommendations provided should lead to a significant improvement in the next iteration. The 0.33 accuracy indicates that some knowledge can be transferred to the test data, even if imperfectly. With targeted changes, this performance can be improved.\n",

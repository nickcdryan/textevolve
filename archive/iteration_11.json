  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-agent approach with chain-of-thought and multi-example prompting to answer factual questions. It decomposes the problem into query generation, information retrieval (simulated), answer extraction, and validation. The agents include a query generator, search engine simulator, answer extraction expert, and a strict validator. The workflow begins with `main` calling `call_llm` to generate search queries, then simulates search using `call_llm` for each query, extracts an answer from the search results using `call_llm`, and validates the answer also using `call_llm` before returning the result.",

The search results show conflicting information, with GSMArena reporting \"480 x 800 pixels\" in one result and \"540 x 960 pixels\" in another.

Use these constraints to filter the search results before extracting information.\n    *   **Example:** If the question is \"What was the price of X in 2020?\", the system should filter search results to include only pages that were published or updated in 2020, or that explicitly refer to 2020 prices.\n\n4.  **Add an \"Explain Your Reasoning\" Step (Priority: Medium):**\n    *   **Details:** Before generating the final answer, have the system generate a brief explanation of *why* it selected the answer it did, which sources it used, and how it resolved any conflicting information.\n    *   **Implementation:** Add an intermediate step where the system generates a justification for its answer, including the sources used, their reliability scores, and how it resolved any discrepancies. This output is purely for debugging/analysis and isn't shown to the user.\n    *   **Example:** \"I chose '480 x 800 pixels' because GSMArena.com, PhoneArena.com, and Amazon.com all report this resolution. While PhoneArena.com reports '480 x 854', GSMArena has a higher reliability score and the other two sources support the '480 x 800' resolution.\"\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are **stable** but **inconsistent**.

Personal blogs: Very low score.\n\n2.  **Develop a Fact Verification Module (Priority: High):**\n    *   **Details:** Design a module that cross-references extracted information with multiple sources. This module should flag inconsistencies or contradictions.\n    *   **Implementation:** When conflicting information is found, the system should prioritize information from more reliable sources based on the source scoring system. It should also consider the number of sources that support a particular fact.\n    *   **Example:** If one source states \"480 x 854\" and three sources state \"480 x 800\", and the three sources have higher reliability scores, the system should prioritize \"480 x 800\".\n\n3.  **Implement Date Filtering (Priority: Medium):**\n    *   **Details:** If the question contains any temporal reference (e.g., \"On which day, month, and year...\"), the system should filter search results to include only information from the specified time frame.\n    *   **Implementation:** Enhance the query parsing to identify temporal constraints. Use these constraints to filter the search results before extracting information.\n    *   **Example:** If the question is \"What was the price of X in 2020?\", the system should filter search results to include only pages that were published or updated in 2020, or that explicitly refer to 2020 prices.\n\n4.  **Add an \"Explain Your Reasoning\" Step (Priority: Medium):**\n    *   **Details:** Before generating the final answer, have the system generate a brief explanation of *why* it selected the answer it did, which sources it used, and how it resolved any conflicting information.\n    *   **Implementation:** Add an intermediate step where the system generates a justification for its answer, including the sources used, their reliability scores, and how it resolved any discrepancies. This output is purely for debugging/analysis and isn't shown to the user.\n    *   **Example:** \"I chose '480 x 800 pixels' because GSMArena.com, PhoneArena.com, and Amazon.com all report this resolution. While PhoneArena.com reports '480 x 854', GSMArena has a higher reliability score and the other two sources support the '480 x 800' resolution.\"\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are **stable** but **inconsistent**. While it demonstrates certain strengths, the weaknesses significantly impact overall accuracy. Until the fact verification and source reliability issues are addressed, significant improvement is unlikely.\n"

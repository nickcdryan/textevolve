  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using LLMs to extract participant names and constraints from a question, then solve the scheduling problem, and finally verify the proposed solution. It uses a chain-of-thought approach, with LLMs handling the complex extraction, reasoning, and verification steps through separate functions. The agent roles are specialized extractors, solvers, and verifiers.\n\nThe functions are: `extract_participants()` to extract participant names, `extract_constraints()` to extract constraints, `solve_meeting_problem()` to find a solution, `verify_solution()` to verify, `call_llm()` to call the LLM, and `main()` to orchestrate the entire process. The `main()` function calls `extract_participants()`, `extract_constraints()`, `solve_meeting_problem()`, and `verify_solution()` in sequence to process the input question and generate the meeting schedule. `call_llm()` provides the interface for each of these functions to access the LLM.",

The logic for determining combined availability from individual schedules is flawed.\n- **Limited iterative backtracking/correction:** The system appears to make definitive decisions early on and struggles to revisit or correct them when later analysis reveals inconsistencies (Sample 9). The 're-evaluation' in sample 9 doesn't correct initial misinterpretations.\n- **Inability to synthesize solution:** Even when the system identifies potentially free slots, it does not reliably form a complete solution (e.g. sample 2).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Constraint handling failure:** The core issue is the system's inability to accurately determine available time slots based on the given constraints. This includes correctly identifying busy times and calculating the intersection of available times for all participants.\n- **Solution verification failure:** The LLM does not adequately verify the solutions, often presenting an output that does not address all constraints, or, as in Sample 9, states no solution is possible when a valid one exists.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- The system frequently overlooks or misinterprets busy times for participants, leading to inaccurate availability calculations.\n- The system struggles to handle multiple constraints and preferences simultaneously, resulting in missed valid solutions.\n- The LLM tends to propose candidate solutions based on preliminary assessment, rather than exhaustively searching for one.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is **inaccurate constraint handling**. The system consistently fails to correctly determine available time slots based on the given schedules and constraints, which prevents it from identifying valid meeting times.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Constraint Handling:** Improve the accuracy of constraint handling, specifically the identification and intersection of available time slots for all participants.\n- **Solution Verification:** Implement a more robust solution verification process to ensure that the proposed time slot meets all given constraints.\n- **Iterative Backtracking:** Enhance the system's ability to revisit and correct earlier decisions when later analysis reveals inconsistencies or missed solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Implement a deterministic time slot calculation function:** Rather than relying solely on LLM reasoning for availability calculations, create a Python function that takes participant schedules as input and returns a list of available time slots. This function can perform precise calculations and minimize errors in constraint handling.\n- **Create a dedicated solution verification agent:** Design a separate agent specifically for verifying proposed solutions. This agent should rigorously check whether the proposed time slot satisfies all constraints and preferences, and provide specific feedback on any violations.\n- **Implement a ReAct loop specifically for constraint resolution**: The LLM should reason about each constraint individually and then ACT (using code, if needed) to verify if that constraint is being violated. It should repeat this for EACH participant, before then deciding the valid time slots.\n- **Improve prompt clarity and example selection**: For complex problems, provide the LLM with multiple examples that demonstrate step-by-step reasoning for constraint handling.

      "text_report": "Here's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and guidelines:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample executions highlight the core issues identified in the error analysis:\n\n*   **Sample 1:** While the system attempts a systematic breakdown, the listed \"busy slots\" are often inaccurate, leading to a potentially incorrect \"available slot\" of 9:00.  The reasoning seems logical, but the execution fails to apply constraints properly.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system correctly identifies that the meeting needs to scheduled between multiple people, and attempts to provide times for each. It is able to pick out one time, but then has trouble finding more.\n*   **Sample 3:**  The system lists the correct people and constraints, but the availability times are incorrect, indicating a misunderstanding of the constraints.\n\nOverall, the execution outputs confirm that the system understands the *concept* of scheduling and constraint satisfaction. However, it consistently fails at the precise *execution* of applying these constraints to determine availability.  There's a tendency to make premature conclusions without exhaustively checking all possibilities.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits a *rudimentary* understanding of scheduling and constraint satisfaction. It can identify key elements like participants, busy times, and the goal of finding a common free slot. However, it struggles with the accurate application of constraints, often leading to incorrect or incomplete solutions.

The logic for determining combined availability from individual schedules is flawed.\n- **Limited iterative backtracking/correction:** The system appears to make definitive decisions early on and struggles to revisit or correct them when later analysis reveals inconsistencies (Sample 9). The 're-evaluation' in sample 9 doesn't correct initial misinterpretations.\n- **Inability to synthesize solution:** Even when the system identifies potentially free slots, it does not reliably form a complete solution (e.g. sample 2).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Constraint handling failure:** The core issue is the system's inability to accurately determine available time slots based on the given constraints. This includes correctly identifying busy times and calculating the intersection of available times for all participants.\n- **Solution verification failure:** The LLM does not adequately verify the solutions, often presenting an output that does not address all constraints, or, as in Sample 9, states no solution is possible when a valid one exists.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- The system frequently overlooks or misinterprets busy times for participants, leading to inaccurate availability calculations.\n- The system struggles to handle multiple constraints and preferences simultaneously, resulting in missed valid solutions.\n- The LLM tends to propose candidate solutions based on preliminary assessment, rather than exhaustively searching for one.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is **inaccurate constraint handling**. The system consistently fails to correctly determine available time slots based on the given schedules and constraints, which prevents it from identifying valid meeting times.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Constraint Handling:** Improve the accuracy of constraint handling, specifically the identification and intersection of available time slots for all participants.\n- **Solution Verification:** Implement a more robust solution verification process to ensure that the proposed time slot meets all given constraints.\n- **Iterative Backtracking:** Enhance the system's ability to revisit and correct earlier decisions when later analysis reveals inconsistencies or missed solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Implement a deterministic time slot calculation function:** Rather than relying solely on LLM reasoning for availability calculations, create a Python function that takes participant schedules as input and returns a list of available time slots.

    "capability_report_text": "Here's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and guidelines:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample executions highlight the core issues identified in the error analysis:\n\n*   **Sample 1:** While the system attempts a systematic breakdown, the listed \"busy slots\" are often inaccurate, leading to a potentially incorrect \"available slot\" of 9:00.  The reasoning seems logical, but the execution fails to apply constraints properly.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system correctly identifies that the meeting needs to scheduled between multiple people, and attempts to provide times for each. It is able to pick out one time, but then has trouble finding more.\n*   **Sample 3:**  The system lists the correct people and constraints, but the availability times are incorrect, indicating a misunderstanding of the constraints.\n\nOverall, the execution outputs confirm that the system understands the *concept* of scheduling and constraint satisfaction. However, it consistently fails at the precise *execution* of applying these constraints to determine availability.  There's a tendency to make premature conclusions without exhaustively checking all possibilities.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits a *rudimentary* understanding of scheduling and constraint satisfaction.

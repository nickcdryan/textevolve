  "approach_summary": "This script uses an LLM (Gemini) to answer questions by breaking down the process into three steps: determining the question type, extracting relevant information, and generating the answer. Each step uses a `call_llm` function, acting as a specialized agent with specific system instructions, to generate the desired output based on the given question and examples in the prompt. The functions used are `main`, `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, `generate_answer`, and `call_llm`; `main` orchestrates the entire process by calling the other functions in sequence, passing the question and intermediate results between them, with error handling at each step. The overall workflow involves classifying the question type, extracting relevant information, and then generating the answer based on the extracted information and question type.",

Also of note, Colts WR Marvin Harrison had 8 catches in the game for 145 yards and two touchdowns. The victory marked the Colts' second straight versus the Patriots after having lost the previous six. With the win, the Colts became just the second team in NFL history to begin consecutive seasons 8-0 (the Green Bay Packers began three consecutive seasons 8-0 from 1929 to 1931).

      "question": "PASSAGE: Coming off their commanding road win over the Browns, the Cowboys played their Week 2 home opener under the MNF spotlight.  In the last MNF game at Texas Stadium, Dallas would duel with their NFC East foe, the Philadelphia Eagles.  In the first quarter, the Cowboys trailed early as Eagles kicker David Akers got a 34-yard field goal.  Dallas would answer in their first possession with QB Tony Romo completing a 72-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Philadelphia replied with Akers kicking a 44-yard field goal, yet the 'Boys immediately added to their lead with rookie RB Felix Jones returning a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles would take the lead with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 6-yard TD pass to RB Brian Westbrook, along with LB Chris Gocong recovering a Romo fumble in the Cowboys' endzone for a touchdown.  Dallas immediately responded with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again on a 4-yard TD pass. On Philadelphia's next drive, the referees made two suspect decisions. The first was a non-call on a very obvious facemask on Brian Westbrook that would have given the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54. In the third quarter, the 'Boys regained the lead with Romo's 17-yard TD pass to RB Marion Barber. In the fourth quarter, the Eagles once again took the lead with Westbrook's 1-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Cowboys rallied with Folk nailing a 47-yard field goal and Barber getting a 1-yard TD run. The Eagles had a chance for a game-winning drive, but Dallas' defense stiffened for the victory, sacking the very elusive McNabb twice.

Already banged up on defense, the Patriots lost SS Rodney Harrison to a shoulder injury in the first quarter, and he never returned to the game.

The Patriots played from behind for the rest of the game and could not catch up to the Colts. Patriots QB Tom Brady was intercepted four times in the defeat, and Colts LB Cato June intercepted two of those passes. Also of note, Colts WR Marvin Harrison had 8 catches in the game for 145 yards and two touchdowns.

In the last MNF game at Texas Stadium, Dallas would duel with their NFC East foe, the Philadelphia Eagles.  In the first quarter, the Cowboys trailed early as Eagles kicker David Akers got a 34-yard field goal.  Dallas would answer in their first possession with QB Tony Romo completing a 72-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Philadelphia replied with Akers kicking a 44-yard field goal, yet the 'Boys immediately added to their lead with rookie RB Felix Jones returning a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles would take the lead with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 6-yard TD pass to RB Brian Westbrook, along with LB Chris Gocong recovering a Romo fumble in the Cowboys' endzone for a touchdown.  Dallas immediately responded with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again on a 4-yard TD pass. On Philadelphia's next drive, the referees made two suspect decisions. The first was a non-call on a very obvious facemask on Brian Westbrook that would have given the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54. In the third quarter, the 'Boys regained the lead with Romo's 17-yard TD pass to RB Marion Barber. In the fourth quarter, the Eagles once again took the lead with Westbrook's 1-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Cowboys rallied with Folk nailing a 47-yard field goal and Barber getting a 1-yard TD run. The Eagles had a chance for a game-winning drive, but Dallas' defense stiffened for the victory, sacking the very elusive McNabb twice. In a game that had 9 lead changes, it also set different point records, including most first half points in MNF history (54) and most combined points in the rivalry's history (78). Also, Terrell Owens (3 receptions for 89 yards and 2 touchdowns) reached 132 career touchdown catches, placing him 2nd on the NFL's all-time touchdown receptions list (behind only Jerry Rice's record of 197).",

However, it is missing context and units. While arithmetically correct, the output does not indicate *what* the 13 points *are*. It's an incomplete answer for the question.\n*   **Output 2 (\"Marvin Harrison\"):**  This output provides a name, which could be correct, but without the question, it's impossible to determine the correctness or relevance.  It potentially suggests an issue with understanding the required answer type (e.g., a specific metric or value related to Marvin Harrison).  It highlights the semantic understanding issue.\n*   **Output 3 (\"Philadelphia Eagles scored in the first quarter, so the Tampa Bay Buccaneers failed to score in the first quarter.\"):** This shows an inference of which team failed to score, which is indicative of deductive reasoning capabilities.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of arithmetic, information extraction, and reasoning. However, it exhibits significant weaknesses in semantic understanding, providing granular answers, and consistently delivering information at the required level of detail. The system can perform simple calculations and extract entities from the text, but struggles to connect these elements to the specific question's requirements.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning:**  The system can perform basic arithmetic operations accurately.\n*   **Information Extraction:**  The system can identify key entities within the provided context.\n*   **Logical Deduction:** The system can infer information based on supplied facts.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Granularity and Semantic Alignment of Answers:** The system struggles to provide answers at the correct level of detail (e.g., including units) and struggles to give answers that are semantically aligned with the desired answer type (e.g., numerical vs. entity name).\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** The system lacks a robust understanding of how information relates to the specific question being asked and constraints around answers (e.g. is the questions asking \"Who\" or \"How Many\")\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Granularity and Semantic Alignment of Answers**. The inability to consistently provide answers at the correct level of detail requested by the question severely limits the system's usefulness.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the error analysis, existing improvement suggestions and execution analysis, the following specific changes should be implemented in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Prioritize Layered Question Understanding Module:** Immediately implement the Layered Question Understanding Module described in the error analysis. Focus the initial implementation on identifying expected answer *types* (e.g., \"number with units,\" \"entity name,\" \"boolean\").\n2.  **Focus Training Data on Type Matching:** Augment the training data to specifically address answer type matching. Create examples where:\n    *   The question explicitly asks for a number with units (e.g., \"How many yards did X gain?\")\n    *   The correct answer is a number with units (e.g., \"12 yards\")\n    *   The *incorrect* answer is related but of the wrong type (e.g., \"Player X,\" \"Touchdown\").\n3.  **Implement Answer Validation and Correction:** Add a post-processing step to validate and correct answer type. If the Question Understanding Module predicted \"number with units\" and the answer is \"Player X,\" trigger a re-evaluation or a fallback mechanism to generate a numerical answer with units (even if less accurate). If this does not work, return an error message to indicate that the model cannot perform that request.\n4.  **Integrate and Test Semantic Parsing:** Integrate a semantic parsing component that can understand the semantic relationships between entities and concepts within the text. This will help the system extract relevant facts and relationships needed to answer complex questions, as well as constrain output answer types based on the question.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, the system's capabilities are currently **stable** but with significant room for improvement. The execution outputs highlight both strengths (calculation) and critical weaknesses (semantic understanding and granularity). Addressing the \"Improvement Focus\" through the \"Actionable Recommendations\" is expected to lead to significant capability improvements in the next iteration.\n",

If this does not work, return an error message to indicate that the model cannot perform that request.\n4.  **Integrate and Test Semantic Parsing:** Integrate a semantic parsing component that can understand the semantic relationships between entities and concepts within the text. This will help the system extract relevant facts and relationships needed to answer complex questions, as well as constrain output answer types based on the question.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, the system's capabilities are currently **stable** but with significant room for improvement. The execution outputs highlight both strengths (calculation) and critical weaknesses (semantic understanding and granularity). Addressing the \"Improvement Focus\" through the \"Actionable Recommendations\" is expected to lead to significant capability improvements in the next iteration.\n"

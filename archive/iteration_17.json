  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by extracting meeting details and proposing a valid time using an LLM. It decomposes the problem into two main steps: extracting meeting information and proposing a meeting time. The main agent roles are for information extraction and time proposal. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `extract_meeting_info` to get the participants, duration, and schedules, then calls `propose_meeting_time` to find a valid meeting slot, with both functions utilizing `call_llm` to interface with the Gemini API and return text responses. The overall workflow involves extracting information then proposing a valid time that satisfies all participant schedules.",

The outputs adhere to the required \"ANSWER_START/END\" format, but the actual proposed times frequently violate implied or explicit constraints in the original problems (as indicated by the low accuracy).  The system seems to be \"guessing\" times rather than systematically checking availability.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system demonstrates a *rudimentary* capability to parse meeting scheduling requests and generate a time proposal. However, its core capability of *reasoning about and satisfying constraints* is severely deficient. It is unable to reliably produce valid meeting times. The system's ability to extract information and format the output are strengths, but these are overshadowed by the failure to solve the core problem.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Basic Parsing & Information Extraction:** The system can extract participant names and some schedule information from the input text, although this could be improved.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Consistently adheres to the \"ANSWER_START/END\" format.\n* **Input Routing:** The system is able to interpret a sentence that asks to schedule a meeting\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Fails to identify valid meeting times that meet all constraints.

Use a deterministic way to manage the structure of the data.\n\n2.  **Implement Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm:**\n    *   Develop an algorithm that systematically searches for valid meeting times by checking against the structured schedules. Start with a simple brute-force approach and refine it later.\n    *   Consider a \"generate and test\" strategy: generate potential times, then rigorously test them.\n    *   Include a maximum attempt limit to prevent infinite loops.\n\n3.  **Explicit Solution Verification:**\n    *   Add a dedicated verification function that *explicitly* checks each proposed time against *every* participant's schedule.\n    *   This function should return a boolean indicating whether the time is valid.\n    *   If the verification fails, the system *must* reject the proposed time and try a different one.\n\n4.  **Chain-of-Thought Prompting (with Schedule Output):**\n    *   Modify the LLM prompt to encourage a chain-of-thought approach. Crucially, include a step where the LLM *explicitly* outputs the interpreted schedule for each participant in a structured format (as in recommendation #1).\n    *   This will make the reasoning more transparent and allow for easier debugging.

The structured schedule output allows verification of its interpretation.\n\n    ```\n    Participant A is available: Monday 9:00-12:00, Tuesday 14:00-17:00\n    Participant B is available: Monday 10:00-13:00, Wednesday 9:00-11:00\n    ...\n    I will choose a time that works for everyone.\n    ```\n\n5.  **Input-Dependent Routing - Simpler Scenarios First:**\n    *   Start by creating different algorithms that handle the inputs based on the number of participants and the number of constraints. Start with very simple scenarios and increase the amount of complexity over time.\n    *   Route the scenarios so the simple inputs use simple logic, and the complex inputs can use more complex logic.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the provided information, the capabilities are currently **stable, but at a very low level**. The accuracy is poor, and the execution outputs confirm that the system is not reliably solving the core problem. The trend will be negative if the identified weaknesses are not addressed.\n"

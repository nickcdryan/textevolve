  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by having an LLM generate a natural language transformation script and then follow that script to produce the transformed grid. The problem is decomposed into generating the script and following it, using `generate_transformation_script` and `follow_transformation_script` respectively. The LLM acts as an expert in generating transformation scripts and then as an expert in following them. `call_llm` is used to interface with the Gemini model.\n\nThe overall workflow involves: `solve_grid_transformation` which calls `generate_transformation_script` to get a script, verifies it within the function, and then calls `follow_transformation_script` to apply the script. `call_llm` is utilized by both `generate_transformation_script` and `follow_transformation_script` to interact with the LLM.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and focusing on actionable insights for improvement:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n\n*   The system correctly generates Python code to extract non-zero elements and create a new grid.\n*   The code attempts to populate the new grid with these elements, but the input grid is filled with zeros, so this transformation does nothing. The code is needlessly complicated for the input.\n*   The code does execute and prints the final transformed grid.\n*   The extracted logic is incorrect for the task.\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n\n*   The system generates Python code that iterates through the grid.\n*   The transformation logic applied within the code is overly complex and attempts to implement several different rules on different rows.\n*   The generated code executes and presents the final transformed grid as the output.\n*   The extracted logic is incorrect for the task.\n\n**Sample ID 1 (Implicit - noted in Strengths):**\n\n*   The system correctly solved this case. No output available for analysis.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n*   The system consistently provides both the code and the code's output. This suggests the \"Integration of Code Execution and Output\" Improvement Area from the original analysis has had a positive impact.\n*   The generated code is often verbose and could benefit from simplification and optimization.\n*   The system can execute the code and output the transformed grid, even when the logic is flawed.\n*   There is no apparent error handling within the generated code to gracefully deal with unexpected input formats or values.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a basic ability to generate Python code that attempts to transform grids according to perceived rules. It can successfully execute the generated code and output the results. However, its core capability of understanding and applying the correct transformation logic is severely limited, resulting in a low overall accuracy.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation and Execution:** Consistently generates and executes Python code, outputting the transformed grid.\n*   **Basic Logic Implementation:** Can implement basic iterative logic within the generated code.\n*   **Correctness on Simple Cases:** Solves some very simple cases correctly.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:**  Fundamentally struggles to identify and generalize the correct transformation patterns. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Complex Transformation Logic:** Struggles with correctly implementing multiple transformation rules within the same grid.\n*   **Lack of Robustness**: The code does not attempt to handle any edge cases.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**. Without accurate pattern understanding, all other capabilities are of limited value.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Revise Pattern Recognition Algorithm:**\n    *   **Experiment with Different Architectures:** Introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or other image processing methods to identify patterns in the grid transformations.\n    *   **Feature Engineering:** Explore creating explicit features that describe the grid transformations (e.g., symmetry, repetition, relative positions of elements).\n\n2.  **Implement Debugging/Tracing Statements**:\n    *   **Print intermediate states**: Enhance the prompt to request tracing or debugging statements (print statements) showing the grid at various intermediate points to track the logic. This will give us better insight into where the code goes wrong. Example revision to the prompt:  \"After generating the code, insert `print` statements to show the state of the grid after each major transformation step. Then, execute the code and produce the final grid.\"\n\n3.  **Simplify Code Generation & Rule Handling:**\n    *   **Decompose Complex Rules:** If a single transformation involves multiple rules, break it down into simpler, sequential steps. Generate code for each step independently.\n    *   **Prioritize Clarity Over Optimization:** Focus on generating clear, readable code that accurately reflects the transformation logic, even if it is not the most efficient.\n\n4.  **Refine the Prompt**:\n    *   **Add Constraints**: Add \"after you have generated the code please then execute the code and produce the final grid\" to help with code execution.\n    *   **Specify Constraints**: Explicitly state any known constraints or limitations in the prompt. For example, if the transformations always involve certain values or operate within specific regions of the grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the execution analysis, the capabilities related to *code generation* and *output production* are improving and stabilizing. The ability to produce the *correct transformations*, is *declining* if the system is only 33% accurate. We will need to see improvements to the \"Improvement Focus\" to adjust.\n",

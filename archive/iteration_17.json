  "approach_summary": "The script answers factual questions using structured decomposition, adaptive querying, and fact verification, leveraging the Gemini LLM. The problem is decomposed into identifying entities, attributes, and constraints. The agent roles include an expert in question decomposition, adaptive query generation, information retrieval, concise answer extraction and a strict fact verifier. The overall workflow involves `call_llm` being used with different system instructions to decompose the question, generate search queries, retrieve information, extract an answer, and verify the answer's validity against the original question. `main` orchestrates these steps, returning the answer if validated or indicating failure.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and specific instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**AI System Name:** (Assuming a placeholder, please replace)\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**Version:** (Assuming initial version, please replace)\n\n### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe AI system demonstrates basic question answering and verification capabilities but struggles with numerical accuracy, semantic understanding, and knowledge retrieval. Its reliance on internal knowledge limits its ability to answer complex questions accurately. A significant improvement is needed in external knowledge access and numerical reasoning.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs highlight several key issues:\n\n*   **Incorrect Verification:**  Sample ID 0 shows the system verifying an incorrect answer as \"VALID.\" This points to a flawed verification mechanism that primarily relies on string matching rather than semantic understanding. The system misses the numerical and unit incompatibility.\n*   **Defaulting to \"Unclear\":** Sample ID 1 illustrates the system's inability to handle questions requiring external knowledge. It defaults to \"Unclear\" instead of attempting to retrieve relevant information. This exposes a critical gap in its knowledge retrieval capabilities.\n*   **Successful Simple Retrieval:** Sample ID 2 demonstrates that the system can correctly answer questions when the answer is readily available, suggesting a basic information retrieval capability within its existing knowledge base.\n*   **Response Formatting:** The consistent format of `Verification Result`, `ANSWER_START`, and `ANSWER_END` suggests a structured output approach, which is good for parsing but needs improvement in correctness.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses the following capabilities, albeit with varying degrees of proficiency:\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Able to identify key entities and attributes within a question (as evidenced by the capability mapping).\n*   **Simple Question Answering:** Can answer basic fact-based questions when the information is directly available in its knowledge base.\n*   **Basic Verification:** Attempts to verify answers against the question, but the current implementation is superficial.\n*   **Structured Output Generation:** Consistently produces output in a pre-defined format.\n\nThe system is deficient in the following areas:\n\n*   **Numerical Reasoning:** Struggles with numerical precision, unit conversions, and comparisons.\n*   **Semantic Understanding:** Fails to grasp semantic equivalence and nuances in meaning.\n*   **Knowledge Retrieval:** Lacks the ability to access and integrate information from external knowledge sources.\n*   **Error Handling:** Defaults to \"Unclear\" without attempting information retrieval when faced with unknown answers.\n*   **Verification Rigor:** The verification module is ineffective at detecting incorrect answers.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Output:** Consistent output format facilitates integration with other systems.\n*   **Basic Question Answering:** Ability to answer simple questions suggests a foundation to build upon.\n*   **Verification Attempt:** The inclusion of a verification module indicates an awareness of answer validation.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Knowledge Retrieval Deficit:**  Inability to access external knowledge is the most critical bottleneck.\n*   **Inadequate Numerical Reasoning:** Numerical inaccuracies and unit confusion lead to incorrect answers.\n*   **Flawed Verification Logic:** The verification module often fails to identify incorrect answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Knowledge Retrieval**.

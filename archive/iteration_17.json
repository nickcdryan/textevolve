  "approach_summary": "This script uses an LLM-driven iterative self-correction approach to solve grid transformation problems. The problem is initially solved by the LLM, and then the entire reasoning chain (problem, initial solution) is fed back to the LLM for review and correction. The LLM acts as an expert in grid transformations and a self-reviewer, iteratively critiquing its reasoning and generating corrected solutions. The functions used are `main`, which calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which then uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API. The overall workflow is initial solution generation, followed by iterative self-correction via critique and refinement of the solution, until a satisfactory solution is found or the maximum number of attempts is reached.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample outputs, and other details.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a critical pattern: the system consistently generates a 3x3 matrix filled with zeros, regardless of the input. This suggests a fundamental flaw in the logic or an unhandled exception that defaults the output to this zero matrix. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags indicate a structured output format, which is positive, but the content within those tags is invariably incorrect. The TimeoutError encountered in Sample 3 highlights an efficiency problem, likely stemming from inefficient algorithms or uncontrolled looping.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates extremely limited capability in solving \"Grid Transformation Tasks.\" While it attempts to process the input and leverages training examples, it consistently fails to identify and apply the correct transformation patterns. The system's inability to generalize, the consistent zero matrix output, and the observed timeout errors indicate significant deficiencies in algorithm design, pattern recognition, and code optimization. The system seems to struggle even with the most basic aspects of grid manipulation and pattern replication.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Representation:**  The system correctly structures the input problem and output format, using grid representations and ANSWER tags. This provides a foundation for improvement.\n*   **Training Example Utilization:**  The system *attempts* to learn from training examples. This intention, though currently unsuccessful, is a positive architectural element.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization (CRITICAL):** The system *cannot* generalize from training examples to test data.  This is the core deficiency.\n*   **Transformation Logic:** The system lacks the fundamental logic to perform even basic grid transformations.\n*   **Algorithm Efficiency:**  The system's algorithms are inefficient, leading to timeouts with larger grids.\n*   **Output Validation:** No output validation exists to prevent the generation of nonsensical outputs like the consistent zero matrix.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**.  The system must be able to identify and apply the transformation patterns learned from the training examples to unseen test inputs. This means the algorithms need to be able to extract features, identify relationships, and then replicate those relationships in the output grid.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Basic Pattern Replication Algorithm (Immediate Priority):**  Start with a simple case. For example, if the training data shows an input grid being padded with an extra row and column, implement an algorithm to do *exactly* that.  This will provide a working baseline and a point of comparison for future improvements. Refer to suggestion #6 \"Try implementing the most obvious solutions\" from the source document.\n2.  **Prioritize Pattern Recognition Techniques:** Explore and implement a pattern recognition algorithm. Given the grid structure, techniques like:\n    *   **Sequence alignment:** to identify repeating rows, columns, or diagonals.\n    *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** which have proven useful with image related transformation tasks\n    *   **Graph matching:** to analyze relationships between elements in input and output grids as a graph.\n3.  **Implement Simple Output Validation:** After generating an output, check its dimensions.  Ensure the output is a valid grid (e.g., rectangular matrix). Even this simple check would prevent the consistent zero matrix output. Implement a basic input validation. Check if the format and values of the input grid are acceptable.\n4.  **Code Profiling and Optimization:** Use a profiler to identify the bottlenecks in the code. Address these bottlenecks through more efficient data structures, algorithm optimization, or memoization. Focus on where the timeout error is occurring.\n5.  **Add Targeted Debugging Statements:** Implement detailed print statements at each step of the algorithm, particularly around the pattern matching and output generation stages. Trace the transformations as they happen, or fail to happen.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **stable at a very low level**.  Without significant changes to the algorithm design and implementation, the system will continue to fail on these tasks. The key is to move from a state of \"attempting to learn\" to \"actually learning and applying\" patterns.\n",

This intention, though currently unsuccessful, is a positive architectural element.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization (CRITICAL):** The system *cannot* generalize from training examples to test data.  This is the core deficiency.\n*   **Transformation Logic:** The system lacks the fundamental logic to perform even basic grid transformations.\n*   **Algorithm Efficiency:**  The system's algorithms are inefficient, leading to timeouts with larger grids.\n*   **Output Validation:** No output validation exists to prevent the generation of nonsensical outputs like the consistent zero matrix.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**.  The system must be able to identify and apply the transformation patterns learned from the training examples to unseen test inputs. This means the algorithms need to be able to extract features, identify relationships, and then replicate those relationships in the output grid.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Basic Pattern Replication Algorithm (Immediate Priority):**  Start with a simple case. For example, if the training data shows an input grid being padded with an extra row and column, implement an algorithm to do *exactly* that.  This will provide a working baseline and a point of comparison for future improvements. Refer to suggestion #6 \"Try implementing the most obvious solutions\" from the source document.\n2.  **Prioritize Pattern Recognition Techniques:** Explore and implement a pattern recognition algorithm. Given the grid structure, techniques like:\n    *   **Sequence alignment:** to identify repeating rows, columns, or diagonals.\n    *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** which have proven useful with image related transformation tasks\n    *   **Graph matching:** to analyze relationships between elements in input and output grids as a graph.\n3.  **Implement Simple Output Validation:** After generating an output, check its dimensions.  Ensure the output is a valid grid (e.g., rectangular matrix). Even this simple check would prevent the consistent zero matrix output. Implement a basic input validation. Check if the format and values of the input grid are acceptable.\n4.  **Code Profiling and Optimization:** Use a profiler to identify the bottlenecks in the code. Address these bottlenecks through more efficient data structures, algorithm optimization, or memoization. Focus on where the timeout error is occurring.\n5.  **Add Targeted Debugging Statements:** Implement detailed print statements at each step of the algorithm, particularly around the pattern matching and output generation stages. Trace the transformations as they happen, or fail to happen.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **stable at a very low level**.  Without significant changes to the algorithm design and implementation, the system will continue to fail on these tasks. The key is to move from a state of \"attempting to learn\" to \"actually learning and applying\" patterns.\n"

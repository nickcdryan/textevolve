  "approach_summary": "The script implements a multi-step approach to answer questions using chain-of-thought reasoning, question decomposition and answer synthesis. It decomposes the main question into sub-questions, extracts relevant information for each sub-question, and then synthesizes the extracted information to form a final answer.  The agent roles are expert question decomposer, information extraction expert, and answer synthesis expert. The script uses `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, and `synthesize_answer`, each calling `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model and each using a verification step. The overall workflow is: question decomposition -> information extraction -> answer synthesis, with each step validated by the LLM and retried if needed.",

This is evident in the successful cases where the system correctly identifies players who scored or the total points.\n2.  **Numerical Calculation:** When the question requires a simple numerical answer, such as the total points scored, the system is accurate.\n3. **Partial Correctness:** Even in error cases, the system often identifies *some* of the correct entities, indicating a partial understanding of the question and passage.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Over-inclusion of Entities:** The system sometimes includes extraneous information in its answer, leading to incorrect responses even when it correctly identifies some of the key information.  The first error case exemplifies this.\n2.  **Lack of Precision:** The system sometimes struggles to provide the *most* precise answer based on the question. In the error case, the question asks *which players* intercepted passes, and the system lists all players who intercepted a pass from that one person, rather than the one the question is only referencing.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Lack of precise reasoning/filtering based on the question's intent:** The system needs to improve its ability to filter extracted entities based on more subtle question constraints. It's correctly identifying entities mentioned in relation to the prompt, but it struggles to select *only* the entities that perfectly match the constraints implied by the question.\n2.  **Inability to distinguish between multiple possible correct answers**: When the question asks for 'which player', and multiple players are the answer for the question, the system includes all of them in the response even when that may not be needed.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Over-inclusion of entities:** The system tends to provide more information than requested, leading to incorrect answers by including entities that fit the general context but not the specific constraints of the question.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the system's failure to apply precise constraints when extracting information, resulting in over-inclusive answers that contain correct elements but also irrelevant or incorrect information. It tends to identify relevant entities but fails to filter them according to the specific nuanced requirements of the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** The system needs significant improvement in constraint handling. It must be able to identify and apply constraints correctly to filter extracted entities and provide the most accurate and concise answer.\n2.  **Question Understanding:** More advanced question understanding techniques are required to interpret the precise intent of the question and identify all implied constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a constraint-based filtering module:** After extracting potential entities, implement a filtering module that explicitly checks each entity against all identified constraints from the question. This module should remove any entity that doesn't satisfy all constraints.\n2.  **Refine Question Understanding:** Integrate more sophisticated NLP techniques, such as dependency parsing or semantic role labeling, to better understand the relationships between words in the question and identify implicit constraints. The focus here is more than identifying just the entity type; it is also identifying *how* to use the extracted entities in the final response.\n3.  **Introduce a scoring mechanism for entities:** When multiple entities are extracted, score each entity based on its relevance to the question and the strength of its connection to the constraints. The final answer should include only the highest-scoring entity or entities. This would allow the system to filter out extraneous but partially-related entities.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Success (Extracted both Cody Grimm and Aqib Talib)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failure (Failed to filter out Aqib Talib based on precise question constraint)\n    *   solution_verification: Failure (Incorrectly determined that \"Cody Grimm and Aqib Talib\" was a valid answer)\n",

This is good for parsing, but could be improved to provide more flexible outputs.\n*   The erroneous output \"Cody Grimm and Aqib Talib\" confirms the \"Over-inclusion of Entities\" weakness. The system correctly identified *some* relevant entities (Cody Grimm) but failed to exclude the irrelevant entity (Aqib Talib), demonstrating a lack of precise filtering.\n*   The other outputs (\"John Carlson,\" \"46\") suggest success on simpler question types, highlighting the strengths in information extraction and numerical calculation.\n*   No immediately obvious runtime errors are present.\n*   Given the data, the entity identified, \"John Carlson,\" could be referring to multiple people, as multiple people exist with that name.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses a solid foundation in information extraction and basic numerical reasoning. However, its ability to apply nuanced constraints and provide precise answers is lacking. This significantly limits its usefulness in more complex question-answering scenarios. The core issue revolves around a \"blunt instrument\" approach to information retrieval \u2013 it finds relevant pieces but struggles to assemble them into a refined, targeted response.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Effective at identifying entities and numerical data within provided passages.\n*   **Basic Numerical Calculation:** Accurately performs simple arithmetic operations.\n*   **Partial Correctness:** Even in error cases, the system often identifies *some* of the correct entities, indicating a partial understanding of the question and passage.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Over-inclusion of Entities:**  The system provides extraneous information, leading to incorrect responses.\n*   **Lack of Precision:**  The system struggles to provide the *most* precise answer based on the question.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Has trouble identifying and applying constraints correctly to filter extracted entities and provide the most accurate and concise answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**. This directly addresses the \"Over-inclusion of Entities\" and \"Lack of Precision\" weaknesses. Improving constraint handling will have the greatest impact on overall accuracy and usefulness.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Constraint-Based Filtering Module (Priority 1):**\n    *   **Details:** After extracting potential entities, implement a filtering module that explicitly checks each entity against all identified constraints from the question. This module should remove any entity that doesn't satisfy all constraints.\n    *   **Implementation Steps:**\n        *   **Constraint Identification:** Enhance the question understanding component to explicitly identify constraints (e.g., \"player who intercepted *from* X\").\n        *   **Filtering Logic:**  Create a function that takes an entity and a list of constraints as input. The function returns `True` if the entity satisfies all constraints, and `False` otherwise.\n        *   **Integration:**  Integrate this function into the information extraction pipeline *after* initial entity extraction but *before* answer construction.\n    *   **Testing:** Create a set of test cases specifically designed to evaluate the filtering module's performance with varying types of constraints.\n2.  **Refine Question Understanding with Dependency Parsing and Semantic Role Labeling (Priority 2):**\n    *   **Details:** Integrate more sophisticated NLP techniques, such as dependency parsing or semantic role labeling, to better understand the relationships between words in the question and identify implicit constraints.\n    *   **Implementation Steps:**\n        *   Choose a suitable NLP library (e.g., SpaCy, NLTK) that provides dependency parsing and semantic role labeling capabilities.\n        *   Develop code to parse the question and extract dependency relationships (e.g., subject-verb-object).\n        *   Develop code to extract semantic roles (e.g., agent, patient, instrument) for the entities in the question.\n        *   Use the dependency relationships and semantic roles to identify constraints. For example, if the question asks \"who intercepted *from* X,\" the system should identify that the agent is the interceptor, the verb is \"intercepted,\" and \"X\" is the source.\n3.  **Introduce a Scoring Mechanism for Entities (Mid-Term):**\n    *   **Details:** When multiple entities are extracted, score each entity based on its relevance to the question and the strength of its connection to the constraints. The final answer should include only the highest-scoring entity or entities.\n    *   **Implementation Steps:**\n        *   Define scoring criteria: Relevance to keywords in the question, strength of connection to identified constraints, frequency of mention in the relevant passage.\n        *   Implement a scoring function: Assign weights to each criterion and calculate a score for each extracted entity.\n        *   Set a threshold: Define a threshold score above which an entity is included in the final answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy (0.80) and the identified weaknesses, the capabilities are currently **stable**. However, without addressing the \"Constraint Handling\" issue, the system will likely plateau and may even decline as it encounters more complex question types. The recommended improvements are expected to drive a positive trend in capabilities.\n",

This is evident in the successful cases where the system correctly identifies players who scored or the total points.\n2.  **Numerical Calculation:** When the question requires a simple numerical answer, such as the total points scored, the system is accurate.\n3. **Partial Correctness:** Even in error cases, the system often identifies *some* of the correct entities, indicating a partial understanding of the question and passage.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Over-inclusion of Entities:** The system sometimes includes extraneous information in its answer, leading to incorrect responses even when it correctly identifies some of the key information.  The first error case exemplifies this.\n2.  **Lack of Precision:** The system sometimes struggles to provide the *most* precise answer based on the question. In the error case, the question asks *which players* intercepted passes, and the system lists all players who intercepted a pass from that one person, rather than the one the question is only referencing.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Lack of precise reasoning/filtering based on the question's intent:** The system needs to improve its ability to filter extracted entities based on more subtle question constraints. It's correctly identifying entities mentioned in relation to the prompt, but it struggles to select *only* the entities that perfectly match the constraints implied by the question.\n2.  **Inability to distinguish between multiple possible correct answers**: When the question asks for 'which player', and multiple players are the answer for the question, the system includes all of them in the response even when that may not be needed.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Over-inclusion of entities:** The system tends to provide more information than requested, leading to incorrect answers by including entities that fit the general context but not the specific constraints of the question.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the system's failure to apply precise constraints when extracting information, resulting in over-inclusive answers that contain correct elements but also irrelevant or incorrect information. It tends to identify relevant entities but fails to filter them according to the specific nuanced requirements of the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** The system needs significant improvement in constraint handling. It must be able to identify and apply constraints correctly to filter extracted entities and provide the most accurate and concise answer.\n2.  **Question Understanding:** More advanced question understanding techniques are required to interpret the precise intent of the question and identify all implied constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a constraint-based filtering module:** After extracting potential entities, implement a filtering module that explicitly checks each entity against all identified constraints from the question. This module should remove any entity that doesn't satisfy all constraints.\n2.  **Refine Question Understanding:** Integrate more sophisticated NLP techniques, such as dependency parsing or semantic role labeling, to better understand the relationships between words in the question and identify implicit constraints. The focus here is more than identifying just the entity type; it is also identifying *how* to use the extracted entities in the final response.\n3.  **Introduce a scoring mechanism for entities:** When multiple entities are extracted, score each entity based on its relevance to the question and the strength of its connection to the constraints. The final answer should include only the highest-scoring entity or entities. This would allow the system to filter out extraneous but partially-related entities.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Success (Extracted both Cody Grimm and Aqib Talib)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failure (Failed to filter out Aqib Talib based on precise question constraint)\n    *   solution_verification: Failure (Incorrectly determined that \"Cody Grimm and Aqib Talib\" was a valid answer)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided information.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.80 (4/5)\n*   Error samples: 1/5\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:** (As provided)\n\n## SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS:\n\n```\n[\n  \"ANSWER_START\\nJohn Carlson\\n\\nANSWER_END\\n\",\n  \"ANSWER_START\\nCody Grimm and Aqib Talib\\n\\nANSWER_END\\n\",\n  \"ANSWER_START\\n46\\n\\nANSWER_END\\n\"\n]\n```\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   The output format consistently uses \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END\" tags. This is good for parsing, but could be improved to provide more flexible outputs.\n*   The erroneous output \"Cody Grimm and Aqib Talib\" confirms the \"Over-inclusion of Entities\" weakness. The system correctly identified *some* relevant entities (Cody Grimm) but failed to exclude the irrelevant entity (Aqib Talib), demonstrating a lack of precise filtering.\n*   The other outputs (\"John Carlson,\" \"46\") suggest success on simpler question types, highlighting the strengths in information extraction and numerical calculation.\n*   No immediately obvious runtime errors are present.\n*   Given the data, the entity identified, \"John Carlson,\" could be referring to multiple people, as multiple people exist with that name.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses a solid foundation in information extraction and basic numerical reasoning. However, its ability to apply nuanced constraints and provide precise answers is lacking. This significantly limits its usefulness in more complex question-answering scenarios. The core issue revolves around a \"blunt instrument\" approach to information retrieval \u2013 it finds relevant pieces but struggles to assemble them into a refined, targeted response.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Effective at identifying entities and numerical data within provided passages.\n*   **Basic Numerical Calculation:** Accurately performs simple arithmetic operations.\n*   **Partial Correctness:** Even in error cases, the system often identifies *some* of the correct entities, indicating a partial understanding of the question and passage.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Over-inclusion of Entities:**  The system provides extraneous information, leading to incorrect responses.\n*   **Lack of Precision:**  The system struggles to provide the *most* precise answer based on the question.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Has trouble identifying and applying constraints correctly to filter extracted entities and provide the most accurate and concise answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**. This directly addresses the \"Over-inclusion of Entities\" and \"Lack of Precision\" weaknesses. Improving constraint handling will have the greatest impact on overall accuracy and usefulness.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Constraint-Based Filtering Module (Priority 1):**\n    *   **Details:** After extracting potential entities, implement a filtering module that explicitly checks each entity against all identified constraints from the question. This module should remove any entity that doesn't satisfy all constraints.\n    *   **Implementation Steps:**\n        *   **Constraint Identification:** Enhance the question understanding component to explicitly identify constraints (e.g., \"player who intercepted *from* X\").\n        *   **Filtering Logic:**  Create a function that takes an entity and a list of constraints as input. The function returns `True` if the entity satisfies all constraints, and `False` otherwise.\n        *   **Integration:**  Integrate this function into the information extraction pipeline *after* initial entity extraction but *before* answer construction.\n    *   **Testing:** Create a set of test cases specifically designed to evaluate the filtering module's performance with varying types of constraints.\n2.  **Refine Question Understanding with Dependency Parsing and Semantic Role Labeling (Priority 2):**\n    *   **Details:** Integrate more sophisticated NLP techniques, such as dependency parsing or semantic role labeling, to better understand the relationships between words in the question and identify implicit constraints.\n    *   **Implementation Steps:**\n        *   Choose a suitable NLP library (e.g., SpaCy, NLTK) that provides dependency parsing and semantic role labeling capabilities.\n        *   Develop code to parse the question and extract dependency relationships (e.g., subject-verb-object).\n        *   Develop code to extract semantic roles (e.g., agent, patient, instrument) for the entities in the question.\n        *   Use the dependency relationships and semantic roles to identify constraints. For example, if the question asks \"who intercepted *from* X,\" the system should identify that the agent is the interceptor, the verb is \"intercepted,\" and \"X\" is the source.\n3.  **Introduce a Scoring Mechanism for Entities (Mid-Term):**\n    *   **Details:** When multiple entities are extracted, score each entity based on its relevance to the question and the strength of its connection to the constraints. The final answer should include only the highest-scoring entity or entities.\n    *   **Implementation Steps:**\n        *   Define scoring criteria: Relevance to keywords in the question, strength of connection to identified constraints, frequency of mention in the relevant passage.\n        *   Implement a scoring function: Assign weights to each criterion and calculate a score for each extracted entity.\n        *   Set a threshold: Define a threshold score above which an entity is included in the final answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy (0.80) and the identified weaknesses, the capabilities are currently **stable**. However, without addressing the \"Constraint Handling\" issue, the system will likely plateau and may even decline as it encounters more complex question types. The recommended improvements are expected to drive a positive trend in capabilities.\n"

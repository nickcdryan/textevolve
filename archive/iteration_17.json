  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using LLMs to extract information, convert schedules, find available times, and verify the solution. The problem is decomposed into sequential steps of information extraction, data conversion, solution finding, and validation. The `call_llm` function sends prompts to the Gemini API, and the functions `extract_meeting_data`, `convert_schedules_to_time_slots`, `find_available_time`, and `is_valid_meeting_time` use `call_llm` to perform their respective tasks, with `main` orchestrating the workflow. The `main` function calls `extract_meeting_data` to parse the input question, then calls `convert_schedules_to_time_slots` and `find_available_time` to determine a meeting time, and `is_valid_meeting_time` validates if the time works for all participants.",

    "error_analysis": {
      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error across all provided error cases is: `\"Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\"`. This is a classic JSON parsing error, specifically a `JSONDecodeError`. It indicates that the system is attempting to parse a JSON string, but the provided string is either empty or does not conform to valid JSON syntax. The parser expects the JSON string to start with either a `[` (for a list) or a `{` (for a dictionary/object), but it's encountering something else (or nothing at all).\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the prompt instructions:\n\n1.  The system *attempts* to decompose the scheduling problem into smaller steps, potentially using reasoning or acting cycles.\n2.  The prompt instructs LLMs to perform complex reasoning and understanding tasks instead of relying on basic parsing techniques.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **JSON Parsing Failure:** The system frequently fails to produce valid JSON output, leading to `JSONDecodeError`. This indicates issues with prompt construction, LLM output control, or post-processing of LLM results. The prompt might not be precise enough in specifying the required JSON format, or the LLM is generating text that deviates from this format.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The system doesn't gracefully handle the `JSONDecodeError`. Instead of catching the exception and trying an alternative approach or providing a fallback solution, it crashes or returns the unparsed error message directly.\n3.  **Insufficient Input Validation:** There's no evidence of robust input validation to ensure the problem descriptions are well-formed and contain all the necessary information. This could contribute to parsing failures if the LLM is struggling with malformed input.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **JSON Output Generation:** The primary bottleneck is the unreliable generation of JSON output by the LLM. The `JSONDecodeError` indicates a fundamental failure in adhering to the required output format.\n2.  **Error Recovery:** A secondary but important bottleneck is the lack of error handling and recovery mechanisms. When a JSON parsing error occurs, the system doesn't attempt to self-correct or provide a reasonable fallback, leading to a complete failure.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe main recurring pattern is the consistent `JSONDecodeError`. This suggests a systemic issue related to the prompts used to guide the LLM's output, the output parsing logic, or the LLM's inherent tendency to deviate from strict formatting requirements. Every single example fails due to the same reason.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is **unreliable JSON output generation from the LLM**. The LLM is either not being instructed clearly enough to produce valid JSON, or it is not consistently following those instructions. The \"expecting value\" error indicates that the LLM might be returning an empty string or non-JSON formatted response.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Prompt Engineering for JSON Output:** Refine the prompts to explicitly and repeatedly instruct the LLM to generate valid JSON. Provide examples of the desired JSON structure and emphasize the importance of adhering to this format.\n2.  **JSON Output Validation and Correction:** Implement a function to validate the LLM's output for JSON validity. If invalid JSON is detected, attempt to correct it using regex or a second LLM call focused solely on fixing the JSON format.\n3.  **Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a fallback mechanism to handle cases where JSON parsing consistently fails. This could involve returning a predefined error message, attempting a simpler problem-solving approach, or requesting clarification from the user.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Reinforce JSON formatting in prompts:** Modify prompts to include phrases like \"Respond ONLY with valid JSON\", \"Ensure the output is valid JSON\", and \"The output MUST be a JSON object with the following structure: ...\".\n2.  **Add multiple examples in prompts:** Instead of a single example, include 2-3 examples of the expected JSON output.\n3.  **Implement JSON validation function:** Write a Python function that uses the `json.loads()` method to validate the LLM's output. If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, the function should attempt to fix common JSON errors (e.g., missing commas, incorrect quotes) before retrying.\n4.  **Introduce a JSON-fixing LLM agent:** If the Python-based JSON validation and correction fails, route the output to a specialized LLM agent whose sole purpose is to correct JSON formatting errors. The prompt for this agent should be very specific and include examples of common JSON errors and how to fix them.\n5.  **Implement a \"retry with simplified format\" mechanism:** If JSON parsing fails after several attempts, simplify the expected JSON structure. For example, instead of a complex nested JSON, request a simple flat JSON object with key-value pairs.\n6.  **Implement a more useful fallback.** If all else fails, return a hard-coded message like \"The system encountered an error when trying to solve this problem, we're very sorry!\".\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nFor all samples (0-9):\n\n*   **information_extraction:** Initial information extraction might be working to some extent, as the LLM seems to understand the problem.\n*   **constraint_handling:** Likely failing because the entire process is halted due to JSON parsing error.\n*   **solution_generation:** Likely failing because the entire process is halted due to JSON parsing error.\n*   **solution_verification:** Likely failing because the entire process is halted due to JSON parsing error.\n*   **decision_making:** Likely failing because the entire process is halted due to JSON parsing error.\n\nIn summary, the primary cause of failure is the lack of reliable JSON output. By addressing this with improved prompting, robust validation, and intelligent fallback mechanisms, the overall system's performance and robustness can be significantly improved.\n",

This confirms that the system is failing at the very first step of processing, which is to parse the LLM's output as JSON.  The fact that this error occurs across all samples suggests a systematic problem, most likely related to the initial prompt or the LLM's configuration.

There are no hints of any other capabilities functioning at all.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has **extremely limited capability**.  It is essentially non-functional because it cannot process the LLM's output due to the JSON parsing errors.  While the initial intention of using LLMs for complex reasoning is positive, the system is not even reaching that stage.  The current architecture is fundamentally flawed due to its reliance on consistent JSON output without adequate validation or error handling.

It crashes when it encounters a JSON parsing error instead of attempting recovery or providing a helpful message.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Perfect LLM Output:**  The system's design assumes that the LLM will always produce perfectly formatted JSON, which is an unrealistic expectation.\n*   **Absent Input Validation:** Input is not validated, increasing the potential for issues that cascade through the system.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **JSON Output Reliability and Error Handling**.  The system *must* be able to generate, validate, and gracefully handle cases where the LLM's JSON output is invalid.

Double-check your output to ensure it is valid JSON.\"\n    *   Include multiple examples of the *exact* JSON format expected, including proper escaping of special characters.  Vary the examples slightly to show different possible values.\n    *   Add explicit instructions in the prompt about what to do if the LLM cannot fulfill the request. For example: \"If you cannot produce a valid JSON response for any reason, respond with this JSON: `{\\\"status\\\": \\\"error\\\", \\\"message\\\": \\\"Unable to generate valid response\\\"}`.\"\n2.  **Implement a JSON Validation and Correction Function:**\n    *   Immediately after receiving the LLM's response, use `json.loads()` to attempt to parse the output.\n    *   If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs:\n        *   First, attempt simple fixes like stripping whitespace and adding missing commas.\n        *   If the simple fixes fail, implement a regular expression to extract any JSON-like content from the response. This accounts for LLMs putting text before/after.\n        *   As a *last resort*, send the raw LLM output to a separate LLM specifically designed to fix JSON errors. Prompt it with: \"You are a JSON formatting expert. Your only task is to correct any errors in the following JSON. Return the corrected JSON, and nothing else. Input: [LLM's raw output]\".\n3.  **Implement a Fallback Mechanism:**\n    *   If JSON parsing fails after a reasonable number of attempts (e.g., 3-5), implement a hard-coded fallback.  This could involve:\n        *   Returning a general error message to the user.\n        *   Attempting a simpler, non-JSON-based solution (if possible).\n        *   Requesting the user to rephrase their input.\n    *   The fallback should include logging information to help diagnose the root cause of the parsing failures.\n4.  **Input Validation:**\n    *   Before calling the LLM, do a very basic input validation (e.g. check if the input string is empty).\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **stable at zero**.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error across all provided error cases is: `\"Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\"`. This is a classic JSON parsing error, specifically a `JSONDecodeError`. It indicates that the system is attempting to parse a JSON string, but the provided string is either empty or does not conform to valid JSON syntax. The parser expects the JSON string to start with either a `[` (for a list) or a `{` (for a dictionary/object), but it's encountering something else (or nothing at all).\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the prompt instructions:\n\n1.  The system *attempts* to decompose the scheduling problem into smaller steps, potentially using reasoning or acting cycles.\n2.  The prompt instructs LLMs to perform complex reasoning and understanding tasks instead of relying on basic parsing techniques.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **JSON Parsing Failure:** The system frequently fails to produce valid JSON output, leading to `JSONDecodeError`. This indicates issues with prompt construction, LLM output control, or post-processing of LLM results. The prompt might not be precise enough in specifying the required JSON format, or the LLM is generating text that deviates from this format.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The system doesn't gracefully handle the `JSONDecodeError`. Instead of catching the exception and trying an alternative approach or providing a fallback solution, it crashes or returns the unparsed error message directly.\n3.  **Insufficient Input Validation:** There's no evidence of robust input validation to ensure the problem descriptions are well-formed and contain all the necessary information. This could contribute to parsing failures if the LLM is struggling with malformed input.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **JSON Output Generation:** The primary bottleneck is the unreliable generation of JSON output by the LLM. The `JSONDecodeError` indicates a fundamental failure in adhering to the required output format.\n2.  **Error Recovery:** A secondary but important bottleneck is the lack of error handling and recovery mechanisms. When a JSON parsing error occurs, the system doesn't attempt to self-correct or provide a reasonable fallback, leading to a complete failure.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe main recurring pattern is the consistent `JSONDecodeError`. This suggests a systemic issue related to the prompts used to guide the LLM's output, the output parsing logic, or the LLM's inherent tendency to deviate from strict formatting requirements. Every single example fails due to the same reason.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is **unreliable JSON output generation from the LLM**. The LLM is either not being instructed clearly enough to produce valid JSON, or it is not consistently following those instructions. The \"expecting value\" error indicates that the LLM might be returning an empty string or non-JSON formatted response.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Prompt Engineering for JSON Output:** Refine the prompts to explicitly and repeatedly instruct the LLM to generate valid JSON. Provide examples of the desired JSON structure and emphasize the importance of adhering to this format.\n2.  **JSON Output Validation and Correction:** Implement a function to validate the LLM's output for JSON validity. If invalid JSON is detected, attempt to correct it using regex or a second LLM call focused solely on fixing the JSON format.\n3.  **Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a fallback mechanism to handle cases where JSON parsing consistently fails. This could involve returning a predefined error message, attempting a simpler problem-solving approach, or requesting clarification from the user.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Reinforce JSON formatting in prompts:** Modify prompts to include phrases like \"Respond ONLY with valid JSON\", \"Ensure the output is valid JSON\", and \"The output MUST be a JSON object with the following structure: ...\".\n2.  **Add multiple examples in prompts:** Instead of a single example, include 2-3 examples of the expected JSON output.\n3.  **Implement JSON validation function:** Write a Python function that uses the `json.loads()` method to validate the LLM's output.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to transform a grid by encoding and modifying spatial relationships between numbers. It decomposes the problem into encoding spatial relationships, modifying them based on training examples, and reconstructing the grid. The LLM acts as an expert in spatial reasoning, contextual modification, and grid reconstruction. The functions `preprocess_question` extracts training and test data, `encode_spatial_relationships` encodes spatial relationships in the test input, `apply_contextual_modifications` modifies the encoding, `reconstruct_grid` reconstructs the grid, and `call_llm` interacts with the Gemini model. The overall workflow is: extracting data, encoding spatial information, modifying this information based on examples via the LLM, and then reconstructing the final grid, leveraging the LLM at each transformation step.",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI SYSTEM GRID TRANSFORMATION\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe execution outputs reveal significant flaws in the system's ability to transform input grids based on patterns observed in training examples. While the outputs are consistently formatted in JSON (as required) and the explanation in Sample ID 0 demonstrates an attempt to articulate the transformation rule, the actual transformed grids are consistently incorrect. Key issues observed:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system hallucinates an 8x8 grid when the expected output should be a 3x6 grid (as suggested by the initial Error Analysis). It attempts to implement a \"neighbor-of-3\" rule but does so incorrectly, resulting in a grid that does not align with any plausible transformation of the original input based on training examples (not provided in this report, but assumed to exist from the error analysis). The textual explanation suggests a possible strategy, but the actual implementation within the grid generation is severely flawed.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system generates an 18x18 grid filled predominantly with the value '3'. The pattern generated shows some rudimentary awareness of position (e.g., diagonals of '0' values separating regions of '3's), but the overall transformation is completely divorced from any likely transformation based on training examples. The logic applied is entirely unclear and results in massive over-application of some transformation.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system generates an 11x11 grid. The pattern includes several '5's in key positions, along with other values. The system is clearly attempting to identify specific values and their arrangements; however, the applied logic of transformation and resulting pattern is not a meaningful or valid alteration of the input.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates extremely limited capability in accurately transforming grids based on learned patterns. While capable of producing JSON-formatted outputs and occasionally providing a coherent (though incorrect) explanation, it fails entirely in the core task of grid transformation. Its problem-solving performance is essentially at random.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **JSON Formatting:** Consistent and correct JSON output. This is a minor strength but ensures compatibility with downstream systems.\n*   **Articulating Transformation Rules (Sample ID 0):**  The ability to provide a textual explanation of the intended transformation, even if the implementation is wrong. This indicates some reasoning capability that can be built upon.\n*   **Information Extraction:** The potential extraction of some elements of information, such as the number '3' in Sample ID 0 and several values in Sample ID 2.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The system fundamentally fails to recognize and generalize transformation patterns from training data.\n*   **Grid Transformation Logic:** The implementation of the grid transformation logic is severely flawed and inconsistent across different samples.\n*   **Dimension Handling:** The system incorrectly determines the dimensions of the output grid, generating grids of incorrect sizes.\n*   **Reasoning:** While the system *attempts* to apply a transformation rule, the rule is often incorrect or poorly executed.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**. The system must learn to identify relevant patterns from training data and apply them accurately to unseen input grids.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Replace the Pattern Recognition Algorithm:**\n    *   **Rationale:** The current algorithm is clearly inadequate.\n    *   **Action:** Replace the current pattern recognition algorithm with a more robust method specifically designed for spatial data. Consider Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). These models are designed to identify spatial relationships and patterns. Start with a simple CNN architecture and gradually increase complexity.\n2.  **Implement Dimension Deduction Logic:**\n    *   **Rationale:** The system is failing to accurately determine the output grid's dimensions.\n    *   **Action:** Implement explicit logic to analyze the transformation rule and deduce how it affects the output grid's dimensions. This could involve:\n        *   Analyzing how the number of unique values changes in the training examples.\n        *   Identifying patterns in how the number of rows and columns changes between input and output grids.\n        *   Using a separate prediction model specifically for predicting output grid dimensions based on input grid features.\n3.  **Curriculum Learning:**\n    *   **Rationale:** Start with easier transformations to gradually increase the difficulty for the model.\n    *   **Action:** Begin training with simpler transformation rules (e.g., inverting colors, simple rotations) and gradually introduce more complex patterns. Monitor performance at each stage and adjust the curriculum accordingly.\n4.  **Refine the Training Data:**\n    *   **Rationale:** The quality and diversity of training data directly impact the system's ability to generalize.\n    *   **Action:** Carefully review and refine the training dataset:\n        *   Ensure the training examples accurately represent the types of transformations the system is expected to perform.\n        *   Increase the diversity of the training examples to cover a wider range of possible transformations and grid configurations.\n        *   Include negative examples (i.e., input grids and *incorrect* output grids) to help the system learn what *not* to do.\n5.  **Implement Rigorous Evaluation Metrics:**\n    *   **Rationale:** Accuracy (0/3) provides a top level summary, but more refined metrics can provide insight.\n    *   **Action:** In addition to overall accuracy, track more granular metrics such as:\n        *   **Pixel-wise accuracy:** Measures the percentage of correctly transformed pixels.\n        *   **Structural similarity index (SSIM):** Measures the similarity between the generated grid and the target grid in terms of structure and patterns.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **declining rapidly**.

This is unusual and requires careful interpretation.\n\n**Possible Interpretations and Actionable Insights:**\n\n1.  **No Data Was Processed:**  The most likely scenario is that *no samples* were actually processed during iteration 17.

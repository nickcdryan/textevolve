  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using a \"Transformation Suggestion and Verification\" approach driven by an LLM. It decomposes the problem into data extraction and transformation suggestion/verification steps. The LLM acts as an expert in both extracting structured data and identifying/verifying grid transformations.\n\nThe main functions used are:\n*   `main(question)`: Orchestrates the entire process.\n*   `extract_data(question)`: Extracts training examples and test input from the question using `call_llm`.\n*   `suggest_and_verify_transformation(extracted_data)`: Suggests likely transformations and verifies them using training data, using `call_llm` to generate the transformed grid.\n*   `call_llm(prompt, system_instruction)`: Communicates with the Gemini LLM, sending a prompt and system instruction, and returns the LLM's response.\n\nThe overall workflow involves extracting data from the input question, suggesting and verifying transformations using the extracted data, and then returning the transformed grid.",

        "output": "ANSWER_START\nThe transformation appears to involve extracting a subgrid and rearranging it. Specifically, it seems to be taking rows 2, 4, and 6 from the input grid and stacking them together. This can be verified using the training examples.\n\n    Training Example 1:\n    Input:\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n    Output:\n    [[8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n    [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\n    Rows 2, 4, and 6 extracted are [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Taking the first six elements of each row results in [[0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]]. This doesn't match the output.\n\n    Let's re-examine the output rows and try to see if they are derived from rows 2, 4, and 7 (index 1, 3, and 6).\n    Row 2: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    Row 4: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    Row 6: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    If we extract columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (index 1-6) of those rows then we have:\n    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n    [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    Training Example 1 does not follow this pattern.\n\n    Let's try extracting the rows 2, 4 and 7 and only keeping elements at indexes 1,2,4,5. The indices 1,2,4,5 correspond to the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th element in each row.\n\n    Row 2: [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [8, 8, 0, 0]\n    Row 4: [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [8, 8, 0, 0]\n    Row 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] -> [0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    This doesn't fit the first output.\n\n    The pattern is that it extracts row indices 1, 3, and 6 from the input and takes the columns with indices 1,2,4,5 of the rows, then stacks them together to form the output. Let's re-verify this. This gives the indices 1,2,4,5 corresponding to element position 2,3,5,6 in the row.\n    Training example 1: Row 2 -> [8,8,0,0], Row 4 -> [8,8,0,0], Row 7 -> [0,0,0,0] Not working still.\n\n    However, what if we are extracting columns 2,3,5,6 from rows 2,4,7?\n    Row 2: 8,8,0,0\n    Row 4: 8,8,0,0\n    Row 7: 0,0,0,0.\n    This transformation is too complex and likely incorrect.\n\n    **Final Answer:**\n    Let's try extracting a 3x6 subgrid. The subgrid consists of taking rows 2, 4, and 7 and columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 from the INPUT grid, and making that the OUTPUT grid.\n    ```\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n    Rows 2, 4 and 7 are:\n    Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    Row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    Row 7: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    Columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7:\n    Row 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    Row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    Row 7: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    Stacking:\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

The system jumps between hypotheses without proper verification. This is evident in the first sample output where the system proposes multiple different grid transformations, but fails to definitively identify the correct one.\n*   **Verbose and Confused Reasoning:** The system's reasoning process is verbose and explores numerous incorrect paths. This \"shotgun\" approach indicates a lack of focused and effective reasoning. This is especially obvious in sample 1, where the model attempts numerous complex patterns and ultimately fails.\n*   **Indexing Errors and Misinterpretation of Grid Structure:** The system makes errors in indexing and coordinate handling when extracting and modifying grid elements. This is also noticeable in the first sample output, with the model incorrectly assuming rows and columns to use for pattern generation.\n*   **Poor Solution Verification:** While the system attempts to verify its reasoning, it fails to do so rigorously. The verification steps are superficial and do not reliably detect incorrect pattern identifications.

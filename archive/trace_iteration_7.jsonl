Specifically, each cell in the original input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output grid, with the same value.  It appears the input grid's dimensions are multiplied by 3 to get the output grid dimensions.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n\nEach cell of the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block of the same value in the output grid.  Essentially, replicate each row and column three times.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nGiven the input grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 7, 0]\n]\n```\n\nWe apply the transformation rule:\n\n1.  The cell with value 7 in the top-left corner becomes a 3x3 block of 7s.\n2.  The cell with value 0 in the top-middle becomes a 3x3 block of 0s.\n3.  The cell with value 7 in the top-right becomes a 3x3 block of 7s.\n4.

State the transformation rule explicitly and then provide the output grid.\n    Candidate Rules:\n    Okay, let's analyze the grid transformation task and identify the underlying rule.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe training examples suggest that the transformation involves repeating the input grid's pattern to create a larger 9x9 grid. Specifically, each cell in the original input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output grid, with the same value.  It appears the input grid's dimensions are multiplied by 3 to get the output grid dimensions.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n\nEach cell of the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block of the same value in the output grid.  Essentially, replicate each row and column three times.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nGiven the input grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 7, 0]\n]\n```\n\nWe apply the transformation rule:\n\n1.  The cell with value 7 in the top-left corner becomes a 3x3 block of 7s.\n2.  The cell with value 0 in the top-middle becomes a 3x3 block of 0s.\n3.  The cell with value 7 in the top-right becomes a 3x3 block of 7s.\n4.  And so on.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7],\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7],\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7],\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7],\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7],\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7],\n  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Possible Rules:**\n\n1.  **Block Expansion:** Replace each cell of the input grid with a 3x3 block containing the same value.\n2.  **Repeat Rows and Columns:**  Repeat each row three times and then repeat each column three times.\n3.  **Kronecker Product:** The output grid is the Kronecker product of the input grid with a 3x3 grid of ones. (Where 'ones' in this context means a 3x3 grid where all elements are 1. Each value in the initial matrix is multiplied element-wise by this \"1s\" matrix.)\n\n\n    Evaluation:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are a rule evaluation expert. Assign scores (1-10) to each rule based on its explanatory power."}, "output": "Here's an evaluation of each rule based on its explanatory power (1-10 scale):\n\n*   **Rule 1: Block Expansion:** Replace each cell of the input grid with a 3x3 block containing the same value.\n    *   Score: 10 - This rule accurately and concisely captures the transformation observed in all training examples. It's easy to understand and directly relates the input to the output.\n\n*   **Rule 2: Repeat Rows and Columns:** Repeat each row three times and then repeat each column three times.\n    *   Score: 9 - This rule is functionally equivalent to Rule 1, achieving the same result. However, it describes the process in a slightly more procedural way (repeating rows and then columns), which makes it a little less intuitive than directly expanding each cell into a block.\n\n*   **Rule 3: Kronecker Product:** The output grid is the Kronecker product of the input grid with a 3x3 grid of ones. (Where 'ones' in this context means a 3x3 grid where all elements are 1. Each value in the initial matrix is multiplied element-wise by this \"1s\" matrix.)\n    *   Score: 8 - This rule is the most mathematically formal. While correct, it requires understanding the concept of a Kronecker product, which might not be immediately obvious to everyone. Thus, it's slightly less accessible and has less immediate explanatory power compared to the block expansion rule, even though they represent the same transformation.\n", "status": "success"}

If a '1' is encountered, change all '0's to the left of the first '1' to '2' until another '1' or the edge of the grid.\n3. For each row, iterate from left to right.

Provide three distinct rules."}, "output": "Okay, let's analyze the grid transformation task and identify possible rules based on the provided training examples.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe output grids are smaller than the input grids in all examples. This suggests a rule that involves cropping or extracting a specific region from the input. Let's look for patterns in how the regions are selected.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The output extracts the top-left portion of the input, specifically the 6x8 part.\n*   **Example 2:** The output extracts the top-left portion of the input, specifically the 5x3 part.\n*   **Example 3:** The output extracts the top-left portion of the input, specifically the 8x10 part.\n\nThe common denominator appears to be extracting the top-left section with variable dimensions. Let's analyze the transformations more.\n\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The width seems to be consistently determined by finding the first column that contains number other than 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 (which is none), starting from the left.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The height seems to be consistently determined by finding the first row that contains only 0s, and 1s, starting from the top.\n\n**Proposed Rules:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are three possible transformation rules:\n\n1.  **Rule 1 (Top-Left Extraction with Dynamic Dimensions):** Extract a rectangular subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid. The width of the subgrid is fixed at 3, while the height of the subgrid is determined by the row which contains only 0s, and 1s.\n2.  **Rule 2 (Top-Left Extraction with Fixed Row and Column):** Extract the top-left section of input. The dimensions are fixed to 7x10.\n3.  **Rule 3 (Conditional Top-Left Extraction):** Extract a rectangular subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid. The width of the subgrid is determined by the first column with elements besides the list of numbers, while the height is determined by the row which only contains 0s, and 1s. If the width or height goes out of bound, then extract with current bounds.\n\n**Applying Rule 1 to the Test Input:**\n\nLet's apply **Rule 1 (Top-Left Extraction with Dynamic Dimensions)** to the test input.\n\n*   Find the first row that contains only 0s, and 1s, starting from the top. (Row 1)\n*   Find the width of the extraction. Width is fixed at 3.\n*   So, we extract the top-left section of the input (Row 1, Column 3).\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 1, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Applying Rule 2 to the Test Input:**\n\nLet's apply **Rule 2 (Top-Left Extraction with Fixed Row and Column)** to the test input.\n\n*   Extract the top-left section with (Row 7, Column 10).\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 8]\n  [0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1]\n  [1, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 8, 1, 0]\n  [8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n  [1, 0, 8, 3, 2, 0, 8, 1, 1, 1]\n  [0, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 0, 8, 2, 8]\n]\n```\n\n**Applying Rule 3 to the Test Input:**\n\nLet's apply **Rule 3 (Conditional Top-Left Extraction)** to the test input.\n\n*   Find the first row that contains only 0s, and 1s, starting from the top. (Row 1)\n*   Find the first column that contains elements besides the list of numbers. (This will exceed the bound, so we extract the maximum column width)\n*   So, we extract the top-left section of the input (Row 1, Column 16).\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n]\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the training data, Rule 1 gives the closest results to what we want.\n\n**Test Output (Applying Rule 1):**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 1, 0]\n]\n```", "status": "success"}

State the transformation rule explicitly and then provide the output grid.\n    Candidate Rules:\n    Okay, let's analyze the grid transformation task and identify possible rules based on the provided training examples.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe output grids are smaller than the input grids in all examples. This suggests a rule that involves cropping or extracting a specific region from the input. Let's look for patterns in how the regions are selected.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The output extracts the top-left portion of the input, specifically the 6x8 part.\n*   **Example 2:** The output extracts the top-left portion of the input, specifically the 5x3 part.\n*   **Example 3:** The output extracts the top-left portion of the input, specifically the 8x10 part.\n\nThe common denominator appears to be extracting the top-left section with variable dimensions. Let's analyze the transformations more.\n\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The width seems to be consistently determined by finding the first column that contains number other than 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 (which is none), starting from the left.\n*   **Transformation Rule:** The height seems to be consistently determined by finding the first row that contains only 0s, and 1s, starting from the top.\n\n**Proposed Rules:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are three possible transformation rules:\n\n1.  **Rule 1 (Top-Left Extraction with Dynamic Dimensions):** Extract a rectangular subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid. The width of the subgrid is fixed at 3, while the height of the subgrid is determined by the row which contains only 0s, and 1s.\n2.  **Rule 2 (Top-Left Extraction with Fixed Row and Column):** Extract the top-left section of input. The dimensions are fixed to 7x10.\n3.  **Rule 3 (Conditional Top-Left Extraction):** Extract a rectangular subgrid from the top-left corner of the input grid. The width of the subgrid is determined by the first column with elements besides the list of numbers, while the height is determined by the row which only contains 0s, and 1s. If the width or height goes out of bound, then extract with current bounds.\n\n**Applying Rule 1 to the Test Input:**\n\nLet's apply **Rule 1 (Top-Left Extraction with Dynamic Dimensions)** to the test input.\n\n*   Find the first row that contains only 0s, and 1s, starting from the top. (Row 1)\n*   Find the width of the extraction. Width is fixed at 3.\n*   So, we extract the top-left section of the input (Row 1, Column 3).\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 1, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Applying Rule 2 to the Test Input:**\n\nLet's apply **Rule 2 (Top-Left Extraction with Fixed Row and Column)** to the test input.\n\n*   Extract the top-left section with (Row 7, Column 10).\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 8]\n  [0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1]\n  [1, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 8, 1, 0]\n  [8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n  [1, 0, 8, 3, 2, 0, 8, 1, 1, 1]\n  [0, 8, 8, 3, 8, 1, 0, 8, 2, 8]\n]\n```\n\n**Applying Rule 3 to the Test Input:**\n\nLet's apply **Rule 3 (Conditional Top-Left Extraction)** to the test input.\n\n*   Find the first row that contains only 0s, and 1s, starting from the top. (Row 1)\n*   Find the first column that contains elements besides the list of numbers. (This will exceed the bound, so we extract the maximum column width)\n*   So, we extract the top-left section of the input (Row 1, Column 16).\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n]\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the training data, Rule 1 gives the closest results to what we want.\n\n**Test Output (Applying Rule 1):**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 1, 0]\n]\n```\n\n    Evaluation:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are a rule evaluation expert. Assign scores (1-10) to each rule based on its explanatory power."}, "output": "Here's an evaluation of each rule based on its ability to explain the training examples and the reasoning provided:\n\n*   **Rule 1 (Top-Left Extraction with Dynamic Dimensions):** Score: 7/10\n    *   **Explanation:** This rule captures the essence of extracting a subgrid from the top-left corner. The dynamic height calculation, focusing on rows containing only 0s and 1s, is a decent attempt to generalize across examples. The fixed width of 3, however, seems arbitrary and doesn't fully align with the transformations observed in the training examples. It's a reasonable starting point, but needs refinement.\n*   **Rule 2 (Top-Left Extraction with Fixed Row and Column):** Score: 3/10\n    *   **Explanation:** This rule, with its fixed dimensions of 7x10, fails to account for the variability observed in the output grid sizes in the training examples. While simplicity is a virtue, this rule is too rigid and lacks explanatory power.\n*   **Rule 3 (Conditional Top-Left Extraction):** Score: 6/10\n    *   **Explanation:** This rule is an improvement over Rule 1 because it allows the width to vary. Determining height by rows only containing 0s and 1s is good. However, the trigger criteria for calculating width and height isn't very solid, and it's unclear how to implement it effectively across various inputs. Also, it seems that calculating the width relies on having some numbers which is not on the pre-defined list, which makes it hard to apply. The conditional aspect of extracting within bounds is good for practicality. However, overall, the rule could be more refined.\n\n**Summary of Scores:**\n\n*   Rule 1: 7/10\n*   Rule 2: 3/10\n*   Rule 3: 6/10\n\n**Reasoning for Scores:**\n\nThe scores reflect how well each rule explains the transformations seen in the training examples. Rule 1 gets a moderate score because it captures the core concept of top-left extraction and has a dynamic element (height), but its fixed width is a significant limitation. Rule 2 gets a low score because its fixed dimensions make it very inflexible and unable to adapt to the examples.

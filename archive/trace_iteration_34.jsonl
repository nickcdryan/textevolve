Carolina starting quarterback Jake Delhomme sat out the game with an elbow injury, and was replaced by David Carr. The Buccaneer offense started the game with an exhausting, 11-play, 71-yard drive, capped off by a 3-yard scramble by Jeff Garcia for a touchdown. With 3 minutes left in the first quarter, running back Carnell Williams blasted down the field for an 18-yard run, but his right leg buckled, seriously injuring his knee. As he was being carted off the field, nearly the entire Buccaneers team, along with several Panthers players, huddled around Williams in support. After the injury timeout, Earnest Graham salvaged the drive with a one-yard touchdown run. Tampa Bay extended their halftime lead to 17-0 after a Matt Bryant field goal, meanwhile, Carolina's offense was sputtering, blasted by the Buccaneers defense, who sacked Carr three times, and intercepeted him once. Carr completed only 19 of 41 pass attempts, and Carolina was facing their first shutout in five seasons. With 23 seconds left in regulation, Carolina finally got on the board with a touchdown pass to DeAngelo Williams. An onside kick was unsuccessful, and the Buccaneers won their third straight game. Through four games, the Buccaneers had not given up any points in the first quarter, and quarterback Jeff Garcia had not thrown an interception. After the game, the Buccaneers announced that running back Carnell Williams (torn patellar ligament) and left tackle Luke Petitgout (torn ACL) would both face season-ending surgery. On Wednesday, October 3, linebacker Barrett Ruud was named the NFC Defensive Player of Month for September with a league-leading 51 tackles, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries, and one interception.\n\nQUESTION: Out of the Buccaneers first 4 games, how many had they lost?"}

In the first quarter, Cleveland drew first blood as kicker Phil Dawson managed to get a 28-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Browns increased its lead as RB Jamal Lewis (in his first game back in Baltimore) managed to get a 1-yard touchdown. The Ravens managed to get on the board with LB Ray Lewis returning an interception 35&#160;yards for a touchdown. Fortunately, Cleveland responded with Dawson kicking a 39-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Baltimore took the lead with RB Willis McGahee getting a 2-yard TD run. Fortunately, the Browns replied with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run, while Safety Brodney Pool returned an interception 100&#160;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, the Ravens tied the game with kicker Matt Stover (a former Brown) managed to kick a 34-yard & a 41-yard field goal, while QB Kyle Boller completed a 27-yard TD pass to WR Devard Darling. Afterwards, Baltimore retook the lead with Stover kicking a 47-yard field goal. Cleveland tried to make a comeback, as they managed to get into field goal range. Initially, Dawson's 51-yard attempt was ruled no good. However, it turns out that the ball bounced off the left upright, went in, bounced off the support bar behind the crossbar, and then went back over the crossbar and onto the field. In the end, the Browns were awarded the field goal, tying the score at 30-30 and sending the game to overtime. In overtime, Cleveland sealed the Ravens' fate as Dawson nailed the game-winning 33-yard field goal. With the win, not only did the Browns improve to 6-4, but it also marked the first time since 2001 that Cleveland swept Baltimore. WR/KR/PR Josh Cribbs became the 3rd NFL player since the AFL-NFL merger of 1970 to have 300+ return yards in one game.\n\nQUESTION: Which player scored more field goals, Matt Stover or Phil Dawson?"}

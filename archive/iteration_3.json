  "approach_summary": "The script uses a one-shot learning approach with a large language model to transform input grids based on provided examples. The problem is decomposed into a single LLM call that includes both examples and the question. The LLM acts as an \"expert grid transformer\" and is expected to provide reasoning steps before outputting the final transformed grid.\n\nThe script uses the functions `main`, `transform_grid_with_detailed_examples`, and `call_llm`. `main` calls `transform_grid_with_detailed_examples` to transform the input grid, while `transform_grid_with_detailed_examples` constructs a detailed prompt and uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model. The overall workflow involves preparing a detailed prompt with examples, sending it to the LLM, validating the response, cleaning the response, and returning the transformed grid, or an error message if the transformation fails.",

Also enable DEBUG logging to see the full traces.\n5.  **Address Timeout Issues:** Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks.

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Formatting Errors:** The dominant error is the failure to produce a correctly formatted JSON output (a list of lists enclosed in `[['` and `']]`). This is a fundamental problem preventing any meaningful evaluation of the transformation logic. The repeated validation failures in samples 0 and 1 confirm this.\n*   **Failed Transformations:** The \"Failed to transform grid correctly after multiple attempts\" message indicates that the system struggles to apply the intended transformation, even after repeated tries. This highlights a flaw in the core pattern recognition and grid manipulation logic.\n*   **Timeout Issues:** The timeout error in Sample 2 suggests either inefficient code or, more likely, an infinite loop or excessively complex computation. This prevents the system from even producing an output, indicating a severe performance bottleneck.\n*   **Lack of Specific Error Messages:** The generic \"Failed to transform grid correctly after multiple attempts\" message lacks detail, making debugging difficult. More specific error messages describing the attempted transformation and the reason for failure would be valuable.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates very limited capability. While it can load and process the input grid data (indicated by the capability mapping showing successful information extraction), it consistently fails to correctly transform the grid and format the output correctly. The timeout error further hinders its ability to even attempt a solution in a reasonable timeframe. Overall, the system's core capabilities related to pattern recognition, grid manipulation, and structured output generation are severely deficient.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction:** The system can load and process the input grid data.\n*   **Working Validation Checks:** The validation checks are functioning correctly, identifying formatting errors. This provides a mechanism for detecting and potentially correcting output problems.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Grid Transformation Logic:** The system fails to correctly apply the intended grid transformations. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Structured Output:** The system cannot reliably produce a correctly formatted JSON output (list of lists).\n*   **Timeout Errors:** The system sometimes fails to complete execution within the allocated time, indicating inefficient or looping code.\n*   **Limited Error Reporting:** Generic error messages hamper debugging and problem identification.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Grid Transformation Logic**. Addressing this will unlock the other capabilities.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Rigid Output Formatting:** Create a dedicated function responsible solely for formatting the output as a JSON string `[['...']]`. This should be a separate step, executed *after* any grid transformation attempts. This formatting step needs to be reliable and should always produce a valid list of lists regardless of the actual content. Add validation step to confirm output is in a valid JSON format.\n2.  **Debug Grid Transformation with Detailed Logging:** Add extensive `print` statements (or logging) within the grid transformation logic to track the values of variables, intermediate results, and the execution path. These logs should show the input grid, each attempted transformation, and the reason for failure (if any). Activate DEBUG logging for detailed traces.\n3.  **Break Down the Transformation into Smaller Functions:** Decompose the grid transformation logic into smaller, well-defined functions, each responsible for a specific step. This modular approach will make the code easier to understand, debug, and test. Each function should have a clear purpose and be thoroughly documented.\n4.  **Optimize Performance and Address Timeout:** Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks. Then, focus on optimizing the grid transformation logic to reduce computation time. Consider using more efficient algorithms or data structures. As part of the debugging and logging above, measure the execution time of each step to pinpoint the bottleneck.\n5.  **Implement Specific Transformation Algorithms and Refactor Logic:** Since the pattern recognition is failing, implement targeted pattern detection and transformation algorithms to handle specific grid transformation rules. If some known transformations are rotations, implement rotation algorithms. If other transformations involve shifts, implement shift algorithms. This should dramatically improve the transformation logic.\n6.  **Improve Error Messages:** Replace the generic \"Failed to transform grid correctly after multiple attempts\" message with more specific and informative error messages. These messages should indicate the attempted transformation, the expected result, and the actual result, highlighting the discrepancy. Include the specific reasons for the failure.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided performance data, the capabilities are currently **stable, but at a very low level**. There's no evidence of improvement. The consistent formatting errors, failed transformations, and timeout issues indicate that the underlying issues are not being addressed effectively. Without implementing the recommended improvements, the capabilities will likely remain stagnant.\n",

For example, consider convolution filters or other image processing techniques, even if the data is numerical.\n2.  **Refine the Transformation Logic:**\n    *   Clearly define the steps required for the transformation in pseudocode.\n    *   Break down the transformation into smaller, more manageable functions.\n    *   Add detailed logging to trace the transformation process and identify where the logic is failing.\n3.  **Implement Output Validation:** Before returning the final answer, add a function that explicitly formats the grid output as a JSON string. Ensure that this string starts with `[['` and ends with `']]`.\n4.  **Debugging and Logging:** Add extensive `print` statements or logging throughout the grid transformation functions. This is essential for understanding the system's internal state and identifying the source of errors. Also enable DEBUG logging to see the full traces.\n5.  **Address Timeout Issues:** Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks. Optimize the grid transformation logic to reduce computation time. Consider alternative algorithms or data structures that can improve performance. If necessary, increase the timeout limit, but focus on improving efficiency first.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Successful (extracting grid data)\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Successful (recognizing the grid format)\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation logic)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (output not in expected format)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed (no correct solution generated)\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Successful (extracting grid data)\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Successful (recognizing the grid format)\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation logic)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (output not in expected format)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed (no correct solution generated)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Successful (extracting grid data)\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Successful (recognizing the grid format)\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (timeout before completing transformation logic)\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A (no output generated due to timeout)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed (no solution generated)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Formatting Errors:** The dominant error is the failure to produce a correctly formatted JSON output (a list of lists enclosed in `[['` and `']]`). This is a fundamental problem preventing any meaningful evaluation of the transformation logic. The repeated validation failures in samples 0 and 1 confirm this.\n*   **Failed Transformations:** The \"Failed to transform grid correctly after multiple attempts\" message indicates that the system struggles to apply the intended transformation, even after repeated tries. This highlights a flaw in the core pattern recognition and grid manipulation logic.\n*   **Timeout Issues:** The timeout error in Sample 2 suggests either inefficient code or, more likely, an infinite loop or excessively complex computation. This prevents the system from even producing an output, indicating a severe performance bottleneck.\n*   **Lack of Specific Error Messages:** The generic \"Failed to transform grid correctly after multiple attempts\" message lacks detail, making debugging difficult. More specific error messages describing the attempted transformation and the reason for failure would be valuable.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates very limited capability. While it can load and process the input grid data (indicated by the capability mapping showing successful information extraction), it consistently fails to correctly transform the grid and format the output correctly. The timeout error further hinders its ability to even attempt a solution in a reasonable timeframe. Overall, the system's core capabilities related to pattern recognition, grid manipulation, and structured output generation are severely deficient.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction:** The system can load and process the input grid data.\n*   **Working Validation Checks:** The validation checks are functioning correctly, identifying formatting errors. This provides a mechanism for detecting and potentially correcting output problems.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Grid Transformation Logic:** The system fails to correctly apply the intended grid transformations. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Structured Output:** The system cannot reliably produce a correctly formatted JSON output (list of lists).\n*   **Timeout Errors:** The system sometimes fails to complete execution within the allocated time, indicating inefficient or looping code.\n*   **Limited Error Reporting:** Generic error messages hamper debugging and problem identification.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Grid Transformation Logic**. Addressing this will unlock the other capabilities.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Rigid Output Formatting:** Create a dedicated function responsible solely for formatting the output as a JSON string `[['...']]`. This should be a separate step, executed *after* any grid transformation attempts. This formatting step needs to be reliable and should always produce a valid list of lists regardless of the actual content. Add validation step to confirm output is in a valid JSON format.\n2.  **Debug Grid Transformation with Detailed Logging:** Add extensive `print` statements (or logging) within the grid transformation logic to track the values of variables, intermediate results, and the execution path. These logs should show the input grid, each attempted transformation, and the reason for failure (if any). Activate DEBUG logging for detailed traces.\n3.  **Break Down the Transformation into Smaller Functions:** Decompose the grid transformation logic into smaller, well-defined functions, each responsible for a specific step. This modular approach will make the code easier to understand, debug, and test. Each function should have a clear purpose and be thoroughly documented.\n4.  **Optimize Performance and Address Timeout:** Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks. Then, focus on optimizing the grid transformation logic to reduce computation time. Consider using more efficient algorithms or data structures. As part of the debugging and logging above, measure the execution time of each step to pinpoint the bottleneck.\n5.  **Implement Specific Transformation Algorithms and Refactor Logic:** Since the pattern recognition is failing, implement targeted pattern detection and transformation algorithms to handle specific grid transformation rules. If some known transformations are rotations, implement rotation algorithms. If other transformations involve shifts, implement shift algorithms. This should dramatically improve the transformation logic.\n6.  **Improve Error Messages:** Replace the generic \"Failed to transform grid correctly after multiple attempts\" message with more specific and informative error messages. These messages should indicate the attempted transformation, the expected result, and the actual result, highlighting the discrepancy. Include the specific reasons for the failure.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided performance data, the capabilities are currently **stable, but at a very low level**. There's no evidence of improvement. The consistent formatting errors, failed transformations, and timeout issues indicate that the underlying issues are not being addressed effectively. Without implementing the recommended improvements, the capabilities will likely remain stagnant.\n"

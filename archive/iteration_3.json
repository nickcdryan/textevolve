  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-based information retrieval and answer generation. It decomposes the problem into retrieving relevant context and then generating an answer using that context. The `retrieve_relevant_context` function acts as a search agent, generating search queries, simulating search, and validating the retrieved context for relevance. The `generate_answer_with_context` function acts as an expert at answering questions using the provided context.\n\nThe `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini LLM, taking prompts and system instructions as input. The `retrieve_relevant_context` calls `call_llm` to generate search queries, simulate search, and validate context relevance; this function is then called by the `main` function, which then calls `generate_answer_with_context`, which then calls `call_llm` to create an answer using the retrieved context, finally returning it. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow by calling both functions sequentially.",

This is evidenced in sample ID 2.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n*   The system struggles with questions that require precise factual recall, especially when dealing with dates (Sample ID 1).\n*   The system demonstrates difficulty in identifying unique answers when multiple plausible candidates exist (Sample ID 2). It suggests multiple possibilities instead of identifying the single, correct answer (Lydia Canaan).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Factual Recall Accuracy:** The system's knowledge base seems to have inaccuracies or gaps, leading to incorrect answers, especially with specific dates and nuanced factual information.\n*   **Answer Selection and Prioritization:** The system needs a better mechanism for identifying the *most* correct answer when multiple near-matches or partial answers are available.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Numerical Inaccuracy:** Errors frequently occur when questions involve numbers, specifically years. This suggests potential issues with the system's ability to accurately recall or process numerical data.\n*   **Lack of Definitiveness:** When a question has a single, widely accepted answer, the system sometimes provides multiple possibilities or equivocates, suggesting a problem with authoritative knowledge or ranking of candidate answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate factual recall, particularly involving dates and specific names**. This leads to the system providing incorrect answers even when it understands the question's intent. The root cause could stem from flaws in the training data, the knowledge retrieval mechanism, or the final answer selection process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Knowledge Base Accuracy:** Improve the quality and accuracy of the knowledge base by verifying and correcting existing information.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning and Recall:** Enhance the system's ability to accurately process and recall numerical data, particularly dates.\n*   **Answer Ranking and Selection:** Implement a robust mechanism for ranking and selecting the best answer from multiple candidates, potentially based on source credibility, frequency of appearance, or other relevance metrics.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n*   **Data Verification and Augmentation:** Implement automated and manual processes to verify and correct information in the knowledge base. Focus on fact-checking and updating numerical data (especially dates). Consider augmenting the knowledge base with more comprehensive biographical data, especially for prominent figures.\n*   **Fact Verification Module:** Integrate a fact verification module that cross-references potential answers against multiple external sources to assess their accuracy and reliability.\n*   **Confidence Scoring and Thresholding:** Develop a confidence scoring mechanism for potential answers and set a threshold for acceptance. Answers below the threshold should be rejected, and the system should indicate its uncertainty or seek clarification.\n*   **Improved Ranking Algorithm:** Experiment with different ranking algorithms to prioritize answers based on factors such as source credibility, frequency of mention, and relevance to the question's context. For example, prioritize information extracted from reputable encyclopedias or biographical databases.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct year.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect year as the solution.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the correctness of the answer (1999).\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Extracted several potential candidates but failed to identify the single correct answer.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated a response with multiple possibilities instead of one definitive answer.\n    *   decision_making: Failed to make a decision on the best solution.\n",

This is a positive aspect of the implementation.\n*   **Inaccurate Date Extraction (Sample ID 1):** The system correctly extracted \"July\" (the month) from somewhere, but then incorrectly returned \"1999\" for the year. This confirms the error analysis indicating difficulty with date-related questions. We can infer that July related to a dam completion date.\n*   **Multiple Possibilities (Sample ID 2):** The output correctly identifies multiple individuals who *could* be considered the first rock star in the Middle East. However, the question implies a single definitive answer, which the system fails to provide. The output, while informative, fails to adhere to the prompt's implicit request for a single answer.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Awareness:** The system seems to function as a knowledge retriever and less as an intelligent agent. It extracts relevant pieces of information but struggles to synthesize them into a cohesive, definitive answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary capability for information retrieval and extraction. It can identify relevant information within its knowledge base and format the output correctly. However, it severely lacks the ability to accurately recall specific facts (especially dates), disambiguate between multiple plausible answers, and synthesize information to provide a single, definitive response. The system shows an inability to apply reasoning and prioritization, leading to inaccuracies and vague answers.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Consistent Output Formatting:** The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are consistently used, indicating proper output structuring.\n*   **Information Retrieval:** The system can retrieve relevant information based on the question posed.\n*   **Attempting Answers:** The system doesn't simply say \"I don't know.\" It attempts to provide answers, even when uncertain.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Factual Recall:** The system frequently provides incorrect answers, especially when dealing with dates, numbers, and specific names.\n*   **Poor Answer Selection:** The system struggles to select the single best answer from multiple plausible candidates.\n*   **Limited Reasoning and Contextual Awareness:** The system fails to synthesize information and apply reasoning to provide definitive, contextually appropriate answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Factual Recall Accuracy**.  Addressing this will have the most significant impact on overall performance. An accurate knowledge base is foundational to all other aspects of the system.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis, the following changes should be implemented in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Targeted Data Verification and Correction for Numerical Data (Especially Dates):**  Create a script that identifies and flags all instances of dates in the knowledge base.  Manually verify these dates against reputable external sources (e.g., Wikipedia, Britannica). Correct any inaccuracies found. This is a critical first step.\n2.  **Develop a Simple Date Validation Module:** Before returning a date as part of an answer, run it through a simple validation check.  This check should ensure that the date is plausible within the context of the question.  For instance, in Sample ID 1, flag 1999 because it cannot be verified by any external source as the completion date.\n3.  **Implement a \"Definitiveness\" Score:** For entities (people, places, events), assign a \"definitiveness\" score based on the prevalence and consistency of information about them in the knowledge base and external sources. For example, something commonly known would have a high definitiveness score. In sample ID 2 the AI system failed to identify the correct answer.\n4.  **Revise the Output Logic for Questions Requiring Single Answers:** If the question implies a single answer (e.g., \"Who was the first...\"), and the system retrieves multiple potential candidates, implement a mechanism to rank these candidates based on their \"definitiveness\" scores. Return only the candidate with the highest score. If no candidate exceeds a minimum threshold, return a response indicating uncertainty.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited performance data, it is difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, given the low accuracy score, it is likely that the capabilities are currently **stable but insufficient**. Implementing the actionable recommendations should result in an **improving** trend. Further monitoring and testing will be required to confirm this.\n",

This is evidenced in sample ID 2.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n*   The system struggles with questions that require precise factual recall, especially when dealing with dates (Sample ID 1).\n*   The system demonstrates difficulty in identifying unique answers when multiple plausible candidates exist (Sample ID 2). It suggests multiple possibilities instead of identifying the single, correct answer (Lydia Canaan).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Factual Recall Accuracy:** The system's knowledge base seems to have inaccuracies or gaps, leading to incorrect answers, especially with specific dates and nuanced factual information.\n*   **Answer Selection and Prioritization:** The system needs a better mechanism for identifying the *most* correct answer when multiple near-matches or partial answers are available.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Numerical Inaccuracy:** Errors frequently occur when questions involve numbers, specifically years. This suggests potential issues with the system's ability to accurately recall or process numerical data.\n*   **Lack of Definitiveness:** When a question has a single, widely accepted answer, the system sometimes provides multiple possibilities or equivocates, suggesting a problem with authoritative knowledge or ranking of candidate answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate factual recall, particularly involving dates and specific names**. This leads to the system providing incorrect answers even when it understands the question's intent. The root cause could stem from flaws in the training data, the knowledge retrieval mechanism, or the final answer selection process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Knowledge Base Accuracy:** Improve the quality and accuracy of the knowledge base by verifying and correcting existing information.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning and Recall:** Enhance the system's ability to accurately process and recall numerical data, particularly dates.\n*   **Answer Ranking and Selection:** Implement a robust mechanism for ranking and selecting the best answer from multiple candidates, potentially based on source credibility, frequency of appearance, or other relevance metrics.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n*   **Data Verification and Augmentation:** Implement automated and manual processes to verify and correct information in the knowledge base. Focus on fact-checking and updating numerical data (especially dates). Consider augmenting the knowledge base with more comprehensive biographical data, especially for prominent figures.\n*   **Fact Verification Module:** Integrate a fact verification module that cross-references potential answers against multiple external sources to assess their accuracy and reliability.\n*   **Confidence Scoring and Thresholding:** Develop a confidence scoring mechanism for potential answers and set a threshold for acceptance. Answers below the threshold should be rejected, and the system should indicate its uncertainty or seek clarification.\n*   **Improved Ranking Algorithm:** Experiment with different ranking algorithms to prioritize answers based on factors such as source credibility, frequency of mention, and relevance to the question's context. For example, prioritize information extracted from reputable encyclopedias or biographical databases.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct year.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect year as the solution.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the correctness of the answer (1999).\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Extracted several potential candidates but failed to identify the single correct answer.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated a response with multiple possibilities instead of one definitive answer.\n    *   decision_making: Failed to make a decision on the best solution.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.33 (1/3)\n*   Error samples: 2/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:**\n\n(As provided in the prompt)\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal the following:\n\n*   **Output Format Consistency:** The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are consistently used, indicating proper formatting of the output. This is a positive aspect of the implementation.\n*   **Inaccurate Date Extraction (Sample ID 1):** The system correctly extracted \"July\" (the month) from somewhere, but then incorrectly returned \"1999\" for the year. This confirms the error analysis indicating difficulty with date-related questions. We can infer that July related to a dam completion date.\n*   **Multiple Possibilities (Sample ID 2):** The output correctly identifies multiple individuals who *could* be considered the first rock star in the Middle East. However, the question implies a single definitive answer, which the system fails to provide. The output, while informative, fails to adhere to the prompt's implicit request for a single answer.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Awareness:** The system seems to function as a knowledge retriever and less as an intelligent agent. It extracts relevant pieces of information but struggles to synthesize them into a cohesive, definitive answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary capability for information retrieval and extraction. It can identify relevant information within its knowledge base and format the output correctly. However, it severely lacks the ability to accurately recall specific facts (especially dates), disambiguate between multiple plausible answers, and synthesize information to provide a single, definitive response. The system shows an inability to apply reasoning and prioritization, leading to inaccuracies and vague answers.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Consistent Output Formatting:** The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are consistently used, indicating proper output structuring.\n*   **Information Retrieval:** The system can retrieve relevant information based on the question posed.\n*   **Attempting Answers:** The system doesn't simply say \"I don't know.\" It attempts to provide answers, even when uncertain.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Factual Recall:** The system frequently provides incorrect answers, especially when dealing with dates, numbers, and specific names.\n*   **Poor Answer Selection:** The system struggles to select the single best answer from multiple plausible candidates.\n*   **Limited Reasoning and Contextual Awareness:** The system fails to synthesize information and apply reasoning to provide definitive, contextually appropriate answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Factual Recall Accuracy**.  Addressing this will have the most significant impact on overall performance. An accurate knowledge base is foundational to all other aspects of the system.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis, the following changes should be implemented in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Targeted Data Verification and Correction for Numerical Data (Especially Dates):**  Create a script that identifies and flags all instances of dates in the knowledge base.  Manually verify these dates against reputable external sources (e.g., Wikipedia, Britannica). Correct any inaccuracies found. This is a critical first step.\n2.  **Develop a Simple Date Validation Module:** Before returning a date as part of an answer, run it through a simple validation check.  This check should ensure that the date is plausible within the context of the question.  For instance, in Sample ID 1, flag 1999 because it cannot be verified by any external source as the completion date.\n3.  **Implement a \"Definitiveness\" Score:** For entities (people, places, events), assign a \"definitiveness\" score based on the prevalence and consistency of information about them in the knowledge base and external sources.

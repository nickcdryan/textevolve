  "approach_summary": "The script implements a RAG approach with explicit source identification and verification, using the Gemini LLM to answer factual questions. The problem is decomposed into generating a context query, retrieving context from a simulated knowledge base, extracting the answer with source citation, and verifying the extracted answer against the cited source. Three agent roles are involved: one for generating context queries, one for extracting answers, and one for verifying answers. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini model, `main` orchestrates the overall workflow, calling `call_llm` to generate a query, extract an answer, and verify the answer based on a knowledge base.",

The system consistently outputs \"No answer can be extracted from the given context.\" or a similar phrase, indicating a failure in extracting the answer rather than a runtime exception.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nGiven the lack of successful cases, it's challenging to definitively identify strengths. However, we can infer potential strengths based on the nature of the errors:\n\n1.  **Robustness to Runtime Errors:** The system appears stable in that it doesn't crash or throw exceptions even when it cannot find an answer. It consistently returns a \"no answer\" message.\n2.  **Clear Error Signaling:** The system explicitly states when it cannot find an answer in the context, which is helpful for debugging.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Failure:** The system consistently fails to extract the correct answer from the context, even when the answer is explicitly stated in the provided golden answer. This is the primary and most significant weakness.\n2.  **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system seems unable to understand the question's intent and relate it to the available information to locate the correct answer. It appears to struggle with identifying the entities and relationships required to answer the question.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The inability to reliably extract information relevant to the question is the most critical bottleneck. Without accurate information extraction, the subsequent steps become irrelevant.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern across all error cases is the system's inability to extract the answer from the context. The system consistently responds with a \"no answer\" message, indicating a systematic failure in the information extraction process. It suggests that the information extraction component is not effectively identifying the relevant information needed to answer the questions.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem to fix is the **ineffective information extraction**. The system's current approach is not successfully identifying and retrieving the answer from the context provided, leading to a consistent \"no answer\" response.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** This area requires significant improvement. The system needs to be able to identify key entities and relationships in the question and then locate the corresponding information in the context.\n2.  **Question Understanding:** The system needs to be able to understand the question's intent, including any specific constraints or requirements.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement More Sophisticated Information Extraction Techniques:** Explore techniques like named entity recognition (NER), relationship extraction, and dependency parsing to better identify relevant information in the context.\n2.  **Fine-tune Pre-trained Language Models:** Fine-tune pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) on question answering datasets to improve the system's ability to understand questions and extract answers.\n3.  **Implement a Retrieval Mechanism:** Develop a retrieval mechanism to identify the most relevant passages in the context based on the question. This can help focus the information extraction process.\n4.  **Introduce Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Use chain-of-thought prompting to encourage the model to explicitly reason through the steps required to answer the question. This can help improve the model's ability to understand the question and identify the relevant information.\n5.  **Add Intermediate Outputs for Debugging:** Include print statements to display intermediate variables and outputs, especially from the information extraction components. This will facilitate debugging and help understand why the system is failing to extract the correct answers. For example, print the initial context, the entities identified, and the extracted relationships.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (due to information extraction failure)\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A (no solution generated)\n*   decision\\_making: N/A (no solution to decide upon)\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (due to information extraction failure)\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A (no solution generated)\n*   decision\\_making: N/A (no solution to decide upon)\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (due to information extraction failure)\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A (no solution generated)\n*   decision\\_making: N/A (no solution to decide upon)\n",

This confirms the Error Analysis Report's assessment of a systematic failure in information extraction. There are no variations in the error message format, indicating consistent error handling but also a lack of nuance in the error reporting. The system is consistently unable to identify and extract the correct answer, even when the answer is explicitly present in the context.  This points to a fundamental flaw in the core extraction logic or the understanding of the query and context.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe current AI system demonstrates extremely limited question answering capabilities. While it exhibits robustness to runtime errors and clear error signaling, its inability to extract relevant information from provided contexts renders it effectively non-functional for its intended purpose. The system lacks the ability to understand the question's intent and relate it to the context to retrieve the correct answer.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Robustness to Runtime Errors:** The system consistently avoids crashing or throwing exceptions. This is a good foundation for building upon.\n*   **Clear Error Signaling:** The system explicitly states when it cannot find an answer. This is useful for debugging and user experience (though perhaps a more informative error message could be considered).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Extraction Failure:** The complete and consistent failure to extract the correct answer from the context is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system demonstrates a significant inability to understand the intent of the question and relate it to the information within the context.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. The ability to reliably identify and retrieve the answer from the context is essential for the system to function.  Without this, all other components are rendered useless.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Hybrid Information Extraction Approach:**\n    *   **Rule-Based System:** Begin with a simple rule-based system that uses keywords and pattern matching to identify potential answers. This provides a baseline and a controlled environment for testing. For example, look for sentences containing keywords from the question or numerical values mentioned in the question.\n    *   **NER/Relationship Extraction:** Integrate Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relationship Extraction models (even simple ones) to identify key entities and relationships in both the question and the context.  Tools like spaCy or Hugging Face Transformers can be leveraged for this.  Focus on identifying entities relevant to the expected answer type.\n2.  **Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach:**\n    *   **Context Chunking and Embedding:** Break the context into smaller chunks and embed each chunk using a sentence transformer model (e.g., Sentence-BERT).\n    *   **Semantic Similarity Search:** Embed the question using the same sentence transformer model and perform a similarity search over the context embeddings to identify the most relevant context chunks.\n    *   **Answer Generation:** Feed the retrieved context chunks and the question to a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for question answering to generate the answer.\n3.  **Improve Question Understanding with Query Rewriting:**\n    *   Use a smaller model or rule-based approach to rewrite the question to be more explicit and contain more keywords that are likely to appear in the answer. For example, if the question is \"What is X?\", rewrite it as \"The value of X is\".\n4.  **Introduce Monitoring and Logging for Information Extraction:**\n    *   Log the output of each information extraction component (e.g., entities identified, relationships extracted, relevant context chunks identified).\n    *   Track the confidence scores associated with these outputs.\n    *   Use this data to identify patterns and areas for improvement in the information extraction process.  For instance, track which entity types are most often missed.\n5.  **Develop Unit Tests for Information Extraction:**\n    *   Create a suite of unit tests that specifically target the information extraction components.\n    *   These tests should cover a variety of question types and context scenarios.\n    *   Use these tests to verify that the information extraction components are correctly identifying and extracting the relevant information.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0% accuracy), the capability trend is currently **stable, but at a non-functional level**. Without significant improvements to the information extraction capabilities, the trend will remain stagnant. The implementation of the Actionable Recommendations is expected to lead to an **improving** trend in the next iteration.\n",

It appears to struggle with identifying the entities and relationships required to answer the question.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The inability to reliably extract information relevant to the question is the most critical bottleneck. Without accurate information extraction, the subsequent steps become irrelevant.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern across all error cases is the system's inability to extract the answer from the context. The system consistently responds with a \"no answer\" message, indicating a systematic failure in the information extraction process. It suggests that the information extraction component is not effectively identifying the relevant information needed to answer the questions.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem to fix is the **ineffective information extraction**. The system's current approach is not successfully identifying and retrieving the answer from the context provided, leading to a consistent \"no answer\" response.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** This area requires significant improvement. The system needs to be able to identify key entities and relationships in the question and then locate the corresponding information in the context.\n2.  **Question Understanding:** The system needs to be able to understand the question's intent, including any specific constraints or requirements.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement More Sophisticated Information Extraction Techniques:** Explore techniques like named entity recognition (NER), relationship extraction, and dependency parsing to better identify relevant information in the context.\n2.  **Fine-tune Pre-trained Language Models:** Fine-tune pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) on question answering datasets to improve the system's ability to understand questions and extract answers.\n3.  **Implement a Retrieval Mechanism:** Develop a retrieval mechanism to identify the most relevant passages in the context based on the question. This can help focus the information extraction process.\n4.  **Introduce Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Use chain-of-thought prompting to encourage the model to explicitly reason through the steps required to answer the question. This can help improve the model's ability to understand the question and identify the relevant information.\n5.  **Add Intermediate Outputs for Debugging:** Include print statements to display intermediate variables and outputs, especially from the information extraction components. This will facilitate debugging and help understand why the system is failing to extract the correct answers. For example, print the initial context, the entities identified, and the extracted relationships.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (due to information extraction failure)\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A (no solution generated)\n*   decision\\_making: N/A (no solution to decide upon)\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (due to information extraction failure)\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A (no solution generated)\n*   decision\\_making: N/A (no solution to decide upon)\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (due to information extraction failure)\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A (no solution generated)\n*   decision\\_making: N/A (no solution to decide upon)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:\n- Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n- Error samples: 3/3\n\n### ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:\n(As provided in the original prompt)\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs are consistently \"No answer can be extracted from the given context.\" or similar variations. This confirms the Error Analysis Report's assessment of a systematic failure in information extraction. There are no variations in the error message format, indicating consistent error handling but also a lack of nuance in the error reporting. The system is consistently unable to identify and extract the correct answer, even when the answer is explicitly present in the context.  This points to a fundamental flaw in the core extraction logic or the understanding of the query and context.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe current AI system demonstrates extremely limited question answering capabilities. While it exhibits robustness to runtime errors and clear error signaling, its inability to extract relevant information from provided contexts renders it effectively non-functional for its intended purpose. The system lacks the ability to understand the question's intent and relate it to the context to retrieve the correct answer.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Robustness to Runtime Errors:** The system consistently avoids crashing or throwing exceptions. This is a good foundation for building upon.\n*   **Clear Error Signaling:** The system explicitly states when it cannot find an answer. This is useful for debugging and user experience (though perhaps a more informative error message could be considered).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Extraction Failure:** The complete and consistent failure to extract the correct answer from the context is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system demonstrates a significant inability to understand the intent of the question and relate it to the information within the context.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. The ability to reliably identify and retrieve the answer from the context is essential for the system to function.  Without this, all other components are rendered useless.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Hybrid Information Extraction Approach:**\n    *   **Rule-Based System:** Begin with a simple rule-based system that uses keywords and pattern matching to identify potential answers. This provides a baseline and a controlled environment for testing. For example, look for sentences containing keywords from the question or numerical values mentioned in the question.\n    *   **NER/Relationship Extraction:** Integrate Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relationship Extraction models (even simple ones) to identify key entities and relationships in both the question and the context.  Tools like spaCy or Hugging Face Transformers can be leveraged for this.  Focus on identifying entities relevant to the expected answer type.\n2.  **Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach:**\n    *   **Context Chunking and Embedding:** Break the context into smaller chunks and embed each chunk using a sentence transformer model (e.g., Sentence-BERT).\n    *   **Semantic Similarity Search:** Embed the question using the same sentence transformer model and perform a similarity search over the context embeddings to identify the most relevant context chunks.\n    *   **Answer Generation:** Feed the retrieved context chunks and the question to a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for question answering to generate the answer.\n3.  **Improve Question Understanding with Query Rewriting:**\n    *   Use a smaller model or rule-based approach to rewrite the question to be more explicit and contain more keywords that are likely to appear in the answer. For example, if the question is \"What is X?\", rewrite it as \"The value of X is\".\n4.  **Introduce Monitoring and Logging for Information Extraction:**\n    *   Log the output of each information extraction component (e.g., entities identified, relationships extracted, relevant context chunks identified).\n    *   Track the confidence scores associated with these outputs.\n    *   Use this data to identify patterns and areas for improvement in the information extraction process.  For instance, track which entity types are most often missed.\n5.  **Develop Unit Tests for Information Extraction:**\n    *   Create a suite of unit tests that specifically target the information extraction components.\n    *   These tests should cover a variety of question types and context scenarios.\n    *   Use these tests to verify that the information extraction components are correctly identifying and extracting the relevant information.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0% accuracy), the capability trend is currently **stable, but at a non-functional level**. Without significant improvements to the information extraction capabilities, the trend will remain stagnant. The implementation of the Actionable Recommendations is expected to lead to an **improving** trend in the next iteration.\n"

      "text_report": "Okay, I will perform a thorough forensic analysis of the provided error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system seems to correctly identify the general problem type (meeting scheduling).\n2.  The system likely has a basic understanding of the constraints involved (participant availability, meeting duration, work hours).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The system frequently fails to accurately account for all constraints when determining valid meeting times, leading to the \"No valid meeting time found\" error when a solution actually exists. This likely involves misinterpreting or overlooking specific blocked time slots in participants' schedules.\n2.  **Limited Solution Generation/Exploration:** The system's solution generation component seems limited in its ability to explore the entire space of possible meeting times. Even when valid times exist, the system fails to identify them, suggesting a lack of thoroughness in the search process.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling/Reasoning:** The core bottleneck is the system's inability to precisely and reliably reason about the constraints of each participant's schedule to find valid meeting times. This involves comparing the meeting duration against available time slots for *all* participants, a task which the system appears to struggle with.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary error pattern is consistently reporting \"No valid meeting time found\" when a valid meeting time is explicitly provided in the golden answer. This suggests a systematic failure in the logic that identifies and verifies potential solutions against the given constraints. The errors occur across varying numbers of participants and different schedule complexities, further indicating that the core constraint handling mechanism is the problem.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inaccurate and incomplete constraint handling**, which prevents the system from identifying feasible meeting times even when they exist. Specifically, the system fails to correctly compare the required meeting duration with the available time slots considering the blocked slots of all participants.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** Improve the system's ability to accurately represent and reason about the constraints of each participant's schedule, including blocked time slots.\n2.  **Solution Verification:** Enhance the solution verification component to ensure that any proposed solution is rigorously checked against *all* constraints before being deemed valid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Constraint Modeling:**\n    *   **Instead of relying on regex-based string processing, utilize the LLM's reasoning capabilities.** Use LLM calls to explicitly extract all the blocked time intervals for each participant. E.g., `extract_blocked_times(text, \"Extract the blocked time intervals for Alice, listing the start and end times for each\")`\n    *   Represent schedules as a structured data format (e.g., a list of time intervals) to facilitate easier comparison and reasoning. Use the LLM to convert the unstructured text into this format. E.g., call the LLM with: `structure_schedule(text, \"convert the free and blocked times into a list of tuples in the format (start_time, end_time, status)\")`\n2.  **Improved Solution Verification:**\n    *   **Implement a dedicated \"solution verification agent.\"** This agent's sole purpose is to take a proposed meeting time and rigorously check it against all constraints.\n    *   The solution verification agent should perform a step-by-step comparison of the meeting time against each participant's schedule, explicitly checking for overlaps. This can be done with a chain-of-thought prompt.\n    *   The agent should return a clear \"valid\" or \"invalid\" decision along with a detailed explanation of why the solution passes or fails. For example, create a prompt like: `verify_meeting_time(meeting_time, participant_schedules, \"Step through each participant's schedule and determine if the proposed meeting time conflicts with their existing commitments. Explain your reasoning.\")`\n3.  **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**\n     * Implement a chain-of-thought approach where the system explicitly reasons through each participant's availability before proposing a solution. This will improve transparency and allow for easier debugging. The overall structure should be:\n      * Extract constraints\n      * For each participant, check for available time slots.\n      * Combine results and determine if a common slot exists.\n      * Return result and explain reasoning.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 4:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 6:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 7:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n",

While it can identify the general problem and constraints, it consistently fails to apply those constraints correctly, leading to a high error rate. The system currently lacks the robustness and reliability necessary for practical use. A major shift is needed to focus the system on using LLMs to reason through the task. Current reliance on rule-based parsing limits the ability to solve the task robustly.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Identification:** Correctly identifies the task as meeting scheduling.\n*   **Constraint Recognition:** Understands the presence of constraints like participant availability, meeting duration, and work hours in general.\n*   **Basic Schedule Parsing**: Can extract some schedule information from unstructured text.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** Fails to accurately account for all constraints when determining valid meeting times. The biggest problem is the use of brittle regex and not the use of LLM to reason over text.\n*   **Limited Solution Generation/Exploration:** Unable to thoroughly explore the space of possible meeting times, missing valid solutions. The current framework is not LLM-centric and needs to be redesigned.\n*   **Reliance on Brittle String Parsing**: Current system depends on manual parsing and regex, leading to errors in complex schedules.\n*   **Lack of Solution Verification**: Current system lacks a dedicated verification step to confirm validity of proposed meetings.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Constraint Handling/Reasoning:** The single most important capability to focus on is drastically improving the system's ability to accurately and reliably reason about the constraints of each participant's schedule. This *must* involve shifting away from brittle regex and string parsing and adopting a LLM-centric reasoning approach.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Constraint Extraction:** Replace regex-based parsing with LLM calls to extract all blocked time intervals for each participant. Use prompts like: `extract_blocked_times(text, \"Extract the blocked time intervals for <participant>, listing the start and end times for each\")`\n2.  **Adopt Structured Data Representation:** Use the LLM to convert unstructured schedules into a structured data format (e.g., a list of time intervals as tuples). Use prompts like: `structure_schedule(text, \"Convert the free and blocked times for <participant> into a list of tuples in the format (start_time, end_time, status)\")`\n3.  **Develop a Solution Verification Agent:** Create a specialized agent that takes a proposed meeting time and meticulously checks it against all constraints. The agent should use chain-of-thought reasoning to:\n    *   Compare the proposed meeting time against each participant's schedule, explicitly checking for overlaps. Use prompts like: `verify_meeting_time(meeting_time, participant_schedule, \"Step through <participant>'s schedule and determine if the proposed meeting time conflicts with their existing commitments. Explain your reasoning step by step.\")`\n    *   Return a \"valid\" or \"invalid\" decision with a detailed explanation.\n4.  **Implement Chain-of-Thought Availability Reasoning:** Use chain-of-thought reasoning to determine each participant's availability:\n    * Extract constraints via the LLM as described above.\n    * For each participant, use the LLM to check for available time slots, one by one.\n    * Combine results (using the LLM) and determine if a common slot exists.\n    * Return result and explain reasoning.\n    * Each step must be explicit.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided performance data and error analysis, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but inadequate**. Without significant changes, particularly in constraint handling and solution verification, the system is unlikely to improve significantly. The shift to a LLM-centric approach is expected to provide significant gains.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "Okay, I will perform a thorough forensic analysis of the provided error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system seems to correctly identify the general problem type (meeting scheduling).\n2.  The system likely has a basic understanding of the constraints involved (participant availability, meeting duration, work hours).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The system frequently fails to accurately account for all constraints when determining valid meeting times, leading to the \"No valid meeting time found\" error when a solution actually exists. This likely involves misinterpreting or overlooking specific blocked time slots in participants' schedules.\n2.  **Limited Solution Generation/Exploration:** The system's solution generation component seems limited in its ability to explore the entire space of possible meeting times. Even when valid times exist, the system fails to identify them, suggesting a lack of thoroughness in the search process.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling/Reasoning:** The core bottleneck is the system's inability to precisely and reliably reason about the constraints of each participant's schedule to find valid meeting times. This involves comparing the meeting duration against available time slots for *all* participants, a task which the system appears to struggle with.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary error pattern is consistently reporting \"No valid meeting time found\" when a valid meeting time is explicitly provided in the golden answer. This suggests a systematic failure in the logic that identifies and verifies potential solutions against the given constraints. The errors occur across varying numbers of participants and different schedule complexities, further indicating that the core constraint handling mechanism is the problem.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inaccurate and incomplete constraint handling**, which prevents the system from identifying feasible meeting times even when they exist. Specifically, the system fails to correctly compare the required meeting duration with the available time slots considering the blocked slots of all participants.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** Improve the system's ability to accurately represent and reason about the constraints of each participant's schedule, including blocked time slots.\n2.  **Solution Verification:** Enhance the solution verification component to ensure that any proposed solution is rigorously checked against *all* constraints before being deemed valid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Constraint Modeling:**\n    *   **Instead of relying on regex-based string processing, utilize the LLM's reasoning capabilities.** Use LLM calls to explicitly extract all the blocked time intervals for each participant. E.g., `extract_blocked_times(text, \"Extract the blocked time intervals for Alice, listing the start and end times for each\")`\n    *   Represent schedules as a structured data format (e.g., a list of time intervals) to facilitate easier comparison and reasoning. Use the LLM to convert the unstructured text into this format. E.g., call the LLM with: `structure_schedule(text, \"convert the free and blocked times into a list of tuples in the format (start_time, end_time, status)\")`\n2.  **Improved Solution Verification:**\n    *   **Implement a dedicated \"solution verification agent.\"** This agent's sole purpose is to take a proposed meeting time and rigorously check it against all constraints.\n    *   The solution verification agent should perform a step-by-step comparison of the meeting time against each participant's schedule, explicitly checking for overlaps. This can be done with a chain-of-thought prompt.\n    *   The agent should return a clear \"valid\" or \"invalid\" decision along with a detailed explanation of why the solution passes or fails. For example, create a prompt like: `verify_meeting_time(meeting_time, participant_schedules, \"Step through each participant's schedule and determine if the proposed meeting time conflicts with their existing commitments. Explain your reasoning.\")`\n3.  **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**\n     * Implement a chain-of-thought approach where the system explicitly reasons through each participant's availability before proposing a solution. This will improve transparency and allow for easier debugging. The overall structure should be:\n      * Extract constraints\n      * For each participant, check for available time slots.\n      * Combine results and determine if a common slot exists.\n      * Return result and explain reasoning.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 4:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 6:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 7:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a focused retrieval and reasoning approach with chain of thought to answer questions based on provided documents. It decomposes the problem into three steps: identifying relevant documents, extracting relevant snippets from those documents, and then answering the question based on the snippets. There are three agent roles that are each specialized in their respective steps.\n\nThe functions used are `identify_relevant_documents`, `extract_relevant_snippets`, `answer_question`, `call_llm`, and `main`. The `main` function orchestrates the overall workflow by first calling `identify_relevant_documents` to select the most pertinent documents, then `extract_relevant_snippets` to pull out key information, and finally uses `answer_question` to formulate a response based on the extracted snippets. Each of these functions makes calls to `call_llm` to interface with the LLM using prompts and system instructions.",

This indicates a fundamental issue with how the `main` function is being called in the test script. The function expects two arguments: `question` and `supporting_documents`, but it's only being called with the `question`. This is a straightforward argument mismatch.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nSince there are no success cases, we cannot identify any strengths of the current approach. However, the presence of detailed traceback information is helpful for debugging.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Incorrect Function Call:** The primary weakness is the incorrect way the `main` function is called in the testing script. It's missing the `supporting_documents` argument, leading to a `TypeError`.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** There's no apparent error handling in the code that might catch such argument errors or provide a more informative message before the program crashes.\n3. **Unclear reasoning path**: The system answer and golden answer are empty. The explanation field is also empty which makes debugging and analysis difficult.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Incorrect Function Signature in Test Script:** The test script is calling the `main` function with an incorrect number of arguments. This is the root cause of all the errors.\n2.  **Lack of Input Validation:** The `main` function (or the code calling it) should ideally validate the inputs it receives.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe same `TypeError` occurs in all three error cases, indicating a systemic problem with the test script's invocation of the `main` function.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the incorrect function call in `test_script_3.py`. The `main` function requires both `question` and `supporting_documents` as arguments, but the script is only passing the `question`.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Test Script Correction:** The test script needs to be updated to correctly call the `main` function with both the `question` and `supporting_documents` arguments.\n2.  **Input Validation:** Add input validation in the `main` function to check if both `question` and `supporting_documents` are provided, and raise a more informative error if they are not.\n3. **Add Print Statements for Intermediate outputs**: Print out the question, the supporting documents, and what the system is about to do with them. Also, print out intermediate variables as well to help debug the system.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Modify `test_script_3.py`:**  Change the line `answer = module.main(question)` to `answer = module.main(question, supporting_documents)`. Ensure that `supporting_documents` is properly defined and passed from the test case.\n2.  **Add Input Validation to `main` function:**  Inside the `main` function, add a check like:\n    ```python\n    def main(question, supporting_documents):\n        if not question or not supporting_documents:\n            raise ValueError(\"Both question and supporting_documents must be provided.\")\n        # ... rest of the code ...\n    ```\n3. **Add Print Statements for Intermediate outputs:**\n    ```python\n    def main(question, supporting_documents):\n        print(\"Question:\", question)\n        print(\"Supporting Documents:\", supporting_documents)\n        # ... rest of the code ...\n    ```\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\nAll samples exhibited the same error due to the incorrect function call. Therefore, the capability mapping is identical for all.\n*   **Sample ID 0, 1, 2:** All capabilities (information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making) were effectively not tested due to the initial `TypeError`. The program never reached the point where these capabilities could be assessed.\n",

This indicates a fundamental flaw in the test script (`test_script_3.py`) where the `main` function is being called incorrectly. The function requires both `question` and `supporting_documents`, but the test script only provides the `question` argument. This prevents the AI system from being properly tested, rendering all further analysis moot until this core issue is resolved. Because the `main` function is never correctly called, the system's core capabilities were never tested. This makes it impossible to evaluate information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, or any other high-level functions.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nDue to the consistent `TypeError`, it's impossible to accurately assess the system's capabilities. The system is not even able to begin processing the input because of the error in the test script.  Therefore, any perceived lack of capability is currently masked by this fundamental error. Until the `test_script_3.py` is corrected, any statements about information extraction, reasoning abilities, or the system's general performance would be purely speculative.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\nThe only strength currently apparent is the clear and informative traceback provided by Python.

This would provide a more informative error message and potentially prevent the crash.\n3. **Lack of Output**: The system provided no explanation or answer, this limits understanding of the system's execution.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **correcting the test script** to properly call the `main` function with the correct arguments. This is a prerequisite for any further capability assessment or improvement.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Modify `test_script_3.py`:**\n    *   Find the line `answer = module.main(question)` and change it to `answer = module.main(question, supporting_documents)`.\n    *   Ensure that `supporting_documents` is defined and populated with the appropriate data *before* this line. Example: `supporting_documents = \"Example supporting text for the question.\"` or retrieve it from a file or variable.\n2.  **Add Input Validation to `main` function:**\n    *   Inside the `main` function, add a check like:\n        ```python\n        def main(question, supporting_documents):\n            if not question or not supporting_documents:\n                raise ValueError(\"Both question and supporting_documents must be provided.\")\n            # ... rest of the code ...\n        ```\n    *   This will provide a more informative error message if the function is called incorrectly again in the future.\n3.  **Add Print Statements for Intermediate outputs:**\n    * Add the following print statements at the top of the `main` function:\n        ```python\n        def main(question, supporting_documents):\n            print(\"Question:\", question)\n            print(\"Supporting Documents:\", supporting_documents)\n            # ... rest of the code ...\n        ```\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **stable at zero**.

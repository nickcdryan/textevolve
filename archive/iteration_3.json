  "approach_summary": "This script employs a multi-agent, LLM-driven approach to meeting scheduling, first using an agent to extract constraints from the input text with few-shot examples. Then, another agent finds a potential time slot based on these constraints, and a final agent verifies the proposed solution against the original requirements. The overall workflow involves sequential calls to the LLM to decompose the problem into constraint extraction, solution generation, and verification steps.",

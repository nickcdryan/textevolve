  "approach_summary": "This script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by first extracting key information like participants, duration, and availability using an example-embedded information extraction specialist. Then, it finds suitable time slots based on the extracted information with the help of a scheduling assistant, again leveraging examples. Finally, a critical evaluator verifies the solution against the problem's constraints, ensuring a valid meeting time is proposed, all through the use of a single `call_llm` function.",

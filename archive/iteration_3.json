  "approach_summary": "The script implements a question-decomposition and answer-synthesis approach using the Gemini LLM to enhance reasoning. The main function, `main`, decomposes the original question into sub-questions, answers each sub-question individually, and then synthesizes these answers into a final comprehensive answer. It uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini API, utilizing different system instructions for question decomposition, answering sub-questions, and synthesizing information. The functions `call_llm` sends requests to the Gemini model, and the `main` function orchestrates the decomposition, answering, and synthesis steps to arrive at the final answer.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Frederick had been King of Jerusalem\u2014and as such claimed suzerainty over Cyprus\u2014in right of his wife Isabella II until her death in 1228. That year he arrived first in Cyprus, where he antagonised the nobles, and then in Jerusalem, where he stayed until 1229, leaving in humiliating circumstances after having produced an anti-imperialist reaction in the people. In 1231 he sent Riccardo Filangieri as his marshal. His attempt to assert his authority was opposed by John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, who had been regent until Frederick's arrival. On John's death in 1236 the war was taken up by his son Balian. In 1239 Philip of Montfort assumed the leadership of the opposition. Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. He also held the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, which had been negotiated away from the Saracens by Frederick. So long as the Ibelins controlled the opposition, Filangieri could count on the support of their enemies as well. The Italian cities were also divided between the two factions: Pisa supported Filangieri and Genoa the Ibelins. The Ibelins controlled Beirut, Arsuf, and Caesarea as well as the old capital of Acre. In 1231 the citizens of Acre formed a commune with their headquarters at the church of Saint Andrew's in order to unify their opposition to Filangieri.

That year he arrived first in Cyprus, where he antagonised the nobles, and then in Jerusalem, where he stayed until 1229, leaving in humiliating circumstances after having produced an anti-imperialist reaction in the people. In 1231 he sent Riccardo Filangieri as his marshal. His attempt to assert his authority was opposed by John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, who had been regent until Frederick's arrival. On John's death in 1236 the war was taken up by his son Balian. In 1239 Philip of Montfort assumed the leadership of the opposition. Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. He also held the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, which had been negotiated away from the Saracens by Frederick. So long as the Ibelins controlled the opposition, Filangieri could count on the support of their enemies as well. The Italian cities were also divided between the two factions: Pisa supported Filangieri and Genoa the Ibelins. The Ibelins controlled Beirut, Arsuf, and Caesarea as well as the old capital of Acre. In 1231 the citizens of Acre formed a commune with their headquarters at the church of Saint Andrew's in order to unify their opposition to Filangieri. In 1232 John of Ibelin was elected its mayor.",

The first serious attempt of the Ottoman government to suppress the revolt resulted with the Battle of De\u00e7iq. Terenzio Tocci gathered the Mirdite chieftains on 26 April 1911 in Orosh, proclaimed the independence of Albania, raised the flag of Albania  and established the provisional government. Shefqet Turgut Pasha wanted to meet this threat and returned to the region with 8.000 soldiers. As soon as he reached Shkod\u00ebr on 11 May, he issued a general proclamation which declared martial law and offered an amnesty for all rebels  if they immediately return to their homes. After Ottoman troops entered the area Tocci fled the empire abandoning his activities. On 14 May, three days after his poclamation, Shefqet Turgut Pasha ordered his troops to seize De\u010di\u0107, hill that overlooked Tuzi. Sixty Albanian chieftains rejected Turgut Pasha's proclamation on their meeting in Podgorica on 18 May. After almost a month of intense fightings rebels were trapped and their only choices were either to die fighting, to surrender or to flee to Montenegro. Most of the rebels chose to flee to Montenegro which became a base for large number of rebels determined to attack the Ottoman Empire. Ismail Kemal Bey and Tiranli Cemal bey traveled from Italy to Montenegro at the end of May and met the rebels to convince them to adopt the nationalistic agenda which they eventually did.

The errors stem from incorrect information extraction and flawed reasoning.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Successful Information Extraction in Some Cases:** The system correctly extracts and uses information to answer questions in the success cases (e.g., Sample ID 0, 1, 2, 5, 9). It can identify key data points like dates, scores, and quantities within the passage.\n2.  **Logical Reasoning (When Information is Correct):** In success cases, the system demonstrates the ability to perform logical deductions based on the extracted information. For example, in Sample ID 0, it correctly infers who died first based on the dates of death.\n3. **Providing Context and Explanation:** The system often provides a detailed explanation of its reasoning, which aids in debugging. In many of the successful cases, the system not only provides the correct answer, but also outlines the data it used to arrive at that answer.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** Several error cases (e.g., Sample ID 3, 4, 6, 8) are caused by the system extracting incorrect or irrelevant information from the passage. Dates, scores, and quantities are particularly problematic.\n2.  **Poor Numerical Reasoning:** Sample IDs 3 and 6 demonstrate a weakness in performing basic arithmetic calculations. Even when extracting numbers, the system struggles to calculate the correct difference or total.\n3.  **Semantic Understanding and Inference:** The system sometimes fails to correctly understand the relationships between entities and events described in the passage (e.g., Sample ID 7). It may misunderstand who seized power from whom or misinterpret the context of actions.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Accuracy:** The most significant bottleneck is the system's ability to accurately extract the correct and relevant information from the given passage. Errors in this stage cascade into incorrect reasoning and final answers.\n2.  **Numerical Reasoning and Calculation:** Even with correct information extraction, the system struggles to perform simple arithmetic calculations required to answer quantitative questions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Date Extraction and Calculation Errors:** Several errors revolve around extracting and calculating differences between dates.\n2.  **Confusion with Pronouns and Relationships:** The system appears to get confused with relationships between different objects/people within the passage. This leads to it answering the wrong question in some situations.\n3.  **Numbers:** System appears to extract the wrong numbers when trying to perform calculations in some cases.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate information extraction, specifically for dates and numerical values**. This often leads to miscalculations and flawed reasoning, even when the underlying logic is sound.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the accuracy of information extraction, particularly for dates, numbers, and entity relationships.\n2.  **Numerical Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to perform basic arithmetic calculations accurately.\n3.  **Contextual Understanding:** Improve the model's ability to perform inference on more complex pronoun resolutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Information Extraction Techniques:**\n    *   Implement more robust regular expressions or NLP techniques for date and number extraction.\n    *   Use named entity recognition (NER) models to identify and classify relevant entities (e.g., people, organizations, dates, locations) within the passage.\n    *   Train a separate model specifically for extracting date information.\n2.  **Strengthen Numerical Reasoning Module:**\n    *   Implement a dedicated module for performing numerical calculations.\n    *   Add unit tests to ensure the numerical reasoning module performs correctly.\n    *   Explore using external tools like calculators or symbolic math solvers to improve accuracy.\n3.  **Enhance Semantic Understanding:**\n    *   Use coreference resolution to accurately track entities and their relationships throughout the passage.\n    *   Train the model on a larger dataset of question-answer pairs that require complex reasoning and inference.\n4.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided information, focusing on actionable insights and improvements.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs show a mix of success and failures, reinforcing the error analysis.\n\n*   **Successes (based on provided examples):**  The system can extract simple facts and provide a basic logical deduction when the information is clearly presented and directly answers the question (e.g., Sample ID 0 infers who died first).  The system also demonstrates the ability to format the answer and give context.\n*   **Failures (inferred from Error Analysis and Capability Mapping):** Based on the \"Capability Mapping\" section and the error analysis, we can see that sample IDs 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 all had issues with `information_extraction` and either `solution_generation` or `decision_making`. Because these errors cascade from `information_extraction`, this means even when the correct information is used, the model cannot always generate the correct response.\n\nThe fact that errors are clustered around `information_extraction` and then propagate to later stages like `solution_generation` or `decision_making` confirms the primary issue identified in the original analysis. The sample outputs further support the need to improve information extraction.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates **limited but promising question-answering capabilities**. It can perform simple information extraction and logical deductions in some cases. However, its accuracy is significantly hampered by inaccurate information extraction and weak numerical reasoning. **Overall, the system is currently unreliable for tasks requiring precise information retrieval or calculation.** The quality of the model's information extraction is inconsistent, and this inconsistency degrades the whole system's ability to correctly respond to questions.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction in Ideal Scenarios:** It can correctly identify key data points when they are presented in a straightforward manner within the text.\n*   **Logical Deduction (with correct information):** When it extracts the correct information, it is sometimes able to perform simple logical inferences.\n*   **Contextual Explanation:** It gives explanations and outlines the data it used to arrive at an answer, which allows for debugging and error tracing.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** This is the *most* critical weakness.  The system struggles to reliably extract dates, numbers, and relationships between entities.\n*   **Poor Numerical Reasoning:** It struggles with basic arithmetic, even when the necessary numbers are (sometimes) extracted.\n*   **Inconsistent Semantic Understanding:** It misinterprets relationships, pronouns, and the overall context of the text. This is a secondary but still important weakness.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction Accuracy**.  Addressing this bottleneck will have the most significant impact on overall system performance. This is not to say that other areas don't need improvement, but an improvement in information extraction would increase the reliability of all future steps.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Information Extraction Module:**\n    *   **Details:** Create a separate module specifically for information extraction.  This module should be designed with modularity in mind so that different extraction strategies can be easily swapped in and out.\n    *   **Rationale:** Isolating information extraction allows for focused development, testing, and optimization.  It also enables the use of specialized tools and techniques.\n2.  **Develop a Date Extraction Model:**\n    *   **Details:** Train a new model or fine-tune an existing model specifically to extract date information in various formats.\n    *   **Rationale:** Dates are a recurring source of errors. A dedicated model can improve accuracy and robustness.\n3.  **Improve Numerical Extraction with Type Checking and Regular Expressions:**\n    *   **Details:**  Enhance numerical extraction to include type checking. For example, if the question asks for a number of points, the extraction should filter for numerical values related to scores. Use more sophisticated regular expressions to handle different number formats (e.g., percentages, decimals, currency).\n    *   **Rationale:** The current system often extracts incorrect numbers. Improved filtering and formatting will increase accuracy.\n4.  **Introduce Unit Tests for Numerical Reasoning:**\n    *   **Details:** Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the numerical reasoning module.  These tests should cover a wide range of arithmetic operations and edge cases.\n    *   **Rationale:** Unit tests will ensure the reliability and accuracy of the numerical reasoning module.\n5. **Add Error Logging:**\n    *   **Details:** Log every step of the execution process, so that you can later investigate and correct errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance summary (50% accuracy) and the error analysis, it is difficult to determine if the capabilities are trending up, down or stable. You'd need previous scores to compare against. However, given the specific issues identified, **without targeted improvements, the capabilities are likely to remain stable at a low level of performance or even decline** as the complexity of the tasks increases. Focused improvement on the information extraction is the key to seeing upward trending capabilities.\n",

Even when extracting numbers, the system struggles to calculate the correct difference or total.\n3.  **Semantic Understanding and Inference:** The system sometimes fails to correctly understand the relationships between entities and events described in the passage (e.g., Sample ID 7). It may misunderstand who seized power from whom or misinterpret the context of actions.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Accuracy:** The most significant bottleneck is the system's ability to accurately extract the correct and relevant information from the given passage. Errors in this stage cascade into incorrect reasoning and final answers.\n2.  **Numerical Reasoning and Calculation:** Even with correct information extraction, the system struggles to perform simple arithmetic calculations required to answer quantitative questions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Date Extraction and Calculation Errors:** Several errors revolve around extracting and calculating differences between dates.\n2.  **Confusion with Pronouns and Relationships:** The system appears to get confused with relationships between different objects/people within the passage. This leads to it answering the wrong question in some situations.\n3.  **Numbers:** System appears to extract the wrong numbers when trying to perform calculations in some cases.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate information extraction, specifically for dates and numerical values**. This often leads to miscalculations and flawed reasoning, even when the underlying logic is sound.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the accuracy of information extraction, particularly for dates, numbers, and entity relationships.\n2.  **Numerical Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to perform basic arithmetic calculations accurately.\n3.  **Contextual Understanding:** Improve the model's ability to perform inference on more complex pronoun resolutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Information Extraction Techniques:**\n    *   Implement more robust regular expressions or NLP techniques for date and number extraction.\n    *   Use named entity recognition (NER) models to identify and classify relevant entities (e.g., people, organizations, dates, locations) within the passage.\n    *   Train a separate model specifically for extracting date information.\n2.  **Strengthen Numerical Reasoning Module:**\n    *   Implement a dedicated module for performing numerical calculations.\n    *   Add unit tests to ensure the numerical reasoning module performs correctly.\n    *   Explore using external tools like calculators or symbolic math solvers to improve accuracy.\n3.  **Enhance Semantic Understanding:**\n    *   Use coreference resolution to accurately track entities and their relationships throughout the passage.\n    *   Train the model on a larger dataset of question-answer pairs that require complex reasoning and inference.\n4. Add more print statements and intermediate outputs in your code so that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 6:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 7:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 8:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided information, focusing on actionable insights and improvements.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs show a mix of success and failures, reinforcing the error analysis.\n\n*   **Successes (based on provided examples):**  The system can extract simple facts and provide a basic logical deduction when the information is clearly presented and directly answers the question (e.g., Sample ID 0 infers who died first).  The system also demonstrates the ability to format the answer and give context.\n*   **Failures (inferred from Error Analysis and Capability Mapping):** Based on the \"Capability Mapping\" section and the error analysis, we can see that sample IDs 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 all had issues with `information_extraction` and either `solution_generation` or `decision_making`. Because these errors cascade from `information_extraction`, this means even when the correct information is used, the model cannot always generate the correct response.\n\nThe fact that errors are clustered around `information_extraction` and then propagate to later stages like `solution_generation` or `decision_making` confirms the primary issue identified in the original analysis. The sample outputs further support the need to improve information extraction.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates **limited but promising question-answering capabilities**. It can perform simple information extraction and logical deductions in some cases. However, its accuracy is significantly hampered by inaccurate information extraction and weak numerical reasoning. **Overall, the system is currently unreliable for tasks requiring precise information retrieval or calculation.** The quality of the model's information extraction is inconsistent, and this inconsistency degrades the whole system's ability to correctly respond to questions.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction in Ideal Scenarios:** It can correctly identify key data points when they are presented in a straightforward manner within the text.\n*   **Logical Deduction (with correct information):** When it extracts the correct information, it is sometimes able to perform simple logical inferences.\n*   **Contextual Explanation:** It gives explanations and outlines the data it used to arrive at an answer, which allows for debugging and error tracing.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** This is the *most* critical weakness.  The system struggles to reliably extract dates, numbers, and relationships between entities.\n*   **Poor Numerical Reasoning:** It struggles with basic arithmetic, even when the necessary numbers are (sometimes) extracted.\n*   **Inconsistent Semantic Understanding:** It misinterprets relationships, pronouns, and the overall context of the text. This is a secondary but still important weakness.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction Accuracy**.  Addressing this bottleneck will have the most significant impact on overall system performance. This is not to say that other areas don't need improvement, but an improvement in information extraction would increase the reliability of all future steps.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Information Extraction Module:**\n    *   **Details:** Create a separate module specifically for information extraction.  This module should be designed with modularity in mind so that different extraction strategies can be easily swapped in and out.\n    *   **Rationale:** Isolating information extraction allows for focused development, testing, and optimization.  It also enables the use of specialized tools and techniques.\n2.  **Develop a Date Extraction Model:**\n    *   **Details:** Train a new model or fine-tune an existing model specifically to extract date information in various formats.\n    *   **Rationale:** Dates are a recurring source of errors. A dedicated model can improve accuracy and robustness.\n3.  **Improve Numerical Extraction with Type Checking and Regular Expressions:**\n    *   **Details:**  Enhance numerical extraction to include type checking. For example, if the question asks for a number of points, the extraction should filter for numerical values related to scores. Use more sophisticated regular expressions to handle different number formats (e.g., percentages, decimals, currency).\n    *   **Rationale:** The current system often extracts incorrect numbers. Improved filtering and formatting will increase accuracy.\n4.  **Introduce Unit Tests for Numerical Reasoning:**\n    *   **Details:** Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the numerical reasoning module.  These tests should cover a wide range of arithmetic operations and edge cases.\n    *   **Rationale:** Unit tests will ensure the reliability and accuracy of the numerical reasoning module.\n5. **Add Error Logging:**\n    *   **Details:** Log every step of the execution process, so that you can later investigate and correct errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance summary (50% accuracy) and the error analysis, it is difficult to determine if the capabilities are trending up, down or stable. You'd need previous scores to compare against. However, given the specific issues identified, **without targeted improvements, the capabilities are likely to remain stable at a low level of performance or even decline** as the complexity of the tasks increases. Focused improvement on the information extraction is the key to seeing upward trending capabilities.\n"

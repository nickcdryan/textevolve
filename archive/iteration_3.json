  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using an LLM to first extract meeting details from the input question using example-driven structured extraction. The extracted details are then validated for completeness and correctness, and refined if necessary, using LLM-based verification and refinement steps. Finally, the system uses the extracted data to find available time slots, proposing a suitable time for the meeting.\n\nThe script uses a chain of function calls as a single agent.\n\n`call_llm` - calls the LLM with the given prompt and system instruction, `main` - orchestrates the entire scheduling process, `extract_meeting_details` - extracts structured meeting data from the input text, `validate_extraction` - validates the extracted data for completeness and correctness, `refine_extraction` - refines the extracted meeting data based on validation feedback, and `find_available_slots` - identifies available time slots based on the extracted meeting data.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are observed in the provided outputs. However, there are instances where the reasoning leads to incorrect time slot selections, indicating a logical or algorithmic error.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The system consistently extracts relevant information such as participants, duration, days, work hours, and individual schedules with high accuracy. The \"Validation Result: COMPLETE\" statement confirms this.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** The system recognizes and attempts to integrate various constraints, including work hours, participant schedules, and preferences (e.g., Barbara not wanting to meet on Tuesday, Kathleen's preference to not meet after 14:30).\n3.  **Structured Reasoning:** The system attempts to break down the problem into smaller steps, analyzing available slots and considering participant schedules.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Incorrect Slot Selection:** Despite extracting the information correctly and attempting to reason through the constraints, the system frequently arrives at an incorrect final time slot, as highlighted by the errors in each sample.\n2.  **30-minute Slot Assumption:** The system analysis often falls back to looking for \"30-minute slots\" even when the problem statement explicitly mentions a \"one hour\" duration (e.g., Sample 6 and 9).\n3.  **Inconsistent Availability Checks:** There appear to be flaws in how the system verifies slot availability. The \"Available Slots\" analysis often presents possibilities that contradict the individual schedules that were correctly extracted.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Erroneous Slot Availability Calculation:** The core bottleneck is the flawed logic used to determine the availability of time slots based on the extracted schedules. This calculation is where the system consistently fails.\n2.  **Incorrect Duration Handling:** A failure to correctly account for the duration of the meeting (either 30 minutes or 1 hour) leads to flawed reasoning about overlapping schedules.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Consistent Miscalculation of Availability:** The most prominent pattern is the recurring incorrect identification of available time slots, which then leads to the selection of a non-optimal meeting time.\n2.  **Incorrect Duration Consideration:** The system seems to get confused with different duration of meeting. Either explicitly mentioning time slot of 30-minute instead of 1-hour, or incorrectly analyzing free time slot according to duration provided in the question.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is a **faulty slot availability algorithm** that doesn't accurately determine when *all* participants are free for the *specified duration*. This algorithm seems to be overlooking extracted information, making incorrect inferences, or failing to correctly synthesize the extracted schedule data.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Solution Verification:** Enhance the solution verification stage. Before presenting a time slot, the system must rigorously re-check the extracted schedules to ensure all participants are truly available for the required duration.\n2.  **Schedule Representation and Reasoning:** The way schedules are represented and reasoned about needs improvement. Consider a more programmatic approach (e.g., using boolean arrays or interval trees) to represent time availability, making calculations less prone to errors.\n3.  **Explicit Duration Consideration:** Ensure the code always correctly considers the required duration. A dedicated function `is_slot_available(start_time, duration, schedules)` that explicitly checks availability based on the duration would be beneficial.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Availability Checking Function:** Create a function that takes a start time, duration, and a list of participant schedules as input and returns whether all participants are available during that slot. This will centralize and standardize the availability checking logic.\n2.  **Refine the Slot Selection Algorithm:** Revise the algorithm to explicitly consider the meeting duration. If the duration is one hour, ensure it's looking for a full hour of availability, not just 30 minutes.\n3.  **Add Robustness to Schedule Parsing:** Use a dedicated library for handling time ranges and availability.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 2:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 3:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 5:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 6:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 9:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n",

This demonstrates strong information extraction capabilities.\n*   **Flawed Availability Reasoning:** The \"Available Slots\" analysis consistently makes incorrect claims about participant availability. This is the core problem. For example, in Sample 2, it states, \"They both are free from 9:00-10:00. Therefore, 9:00-9:30 and 9:30-10:00 are options,\" despite no mention of Jennifer schedule availability between 9:00 and 10:00.\n*   **Duration Confusion:** As highlighted in the Error Analysis Report, the system sometimes reverts to thinking in terms of 30-minute slots even when the required duration is different.\n*   **Final Answer Mirroring:** The \"Final Answer\" often simply repeats the flawed reasoning presented in the \"Available Slots\" section, indicating a lack of independent verification or error correction.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system has a solid foundation in information extraction and constraint recognition, but its core reasoning and scheduling logic is fundamentally flawed. It consistently fails to correctly determine available time slots based on the extracted schedule data.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are observed in the provided outputs. However, there are instances where the reasoning leads to incorrect time slot selections, indicating a logical or algorithmic error.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The system consistently extracts relevant information such as participants, duration, days, work hours, and individual schedules with high accuracy. The \"Validation Result: COMPLETE\" statement confirms this.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** The system recognizes and attempts to integrate various constraints, including work hours, participant schedules, and preferences (e.g., Barbara not wanting to meet on Tuesday, Kathleen's preference to not meet after 14:30).\n3.  **Structured Reasoning:** The system attempts to break down the problem into smaller steps, analyzing available slots and considering participant schedules.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Incorrect Slot Selection:** Despite extracting the information correctly and attempting to reason through the constraints, the system frequently arrives at an incorrect final time slot, as highlighted by the errors in each sample.\n2.  **30-minute Slot Assumption:** The system analysis often falls back to looking for \"30-minute slots\" even when the problem statement explicitly mentions a \"one hour\" duration (e.g., Sample 6 and 9).\n3.  **Inconsistent Availability Checks:** There appear to be flaws in how the system verifies slot availability. The \"Available Slots\" analysis often presents possibilities that contradict the individual schedules that were correctly extracted.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Erroneous Slot Availability Calculation:** The core bottleneck is the flawed logic used to determine the availability of time slots based on the extracted schedules. This calculation is where the system consistently fails.\n2.  **Incorrect Duration Handling:** A failure to correctly account for the duration of the meeting (either 30 minutes or 1 hour) leads to flawed reasoning about overlapping schedules.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Consistent Miscalculation of Availability:** The most prominent pattern is the recurring incorrect identification of available time slots, which then leads to the selection of a non-optimal meeting time.\n2.  **Incorrect Duration Consideration:** The system seems to get confused with different duration of meeting. Either explicitly mentioning time slot of 30-minute instead of 1-hour, or incorrectly analyzing free time slot according to duration provided in the question.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is a **faulty slot availability algorithm** that doesn't accurately determine when *all* participants are free for the *specified duration*. This algorithm seems to be overlooking extracted information, making incorrect inferences, or failing to correctly synthesize the extracted schedule data.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Solution Verification:** Enhance the solution verification stage. Before presenting a time slot, the system must rigorously re-check the extracted schedules to ensure all participants are truly available for the required duration.\n2.  **Schedule Representation and Reasoning:** The way schedules are represented and reasoned about needs improvement. Consider a more programmatic approach (e.g., using boolean arrays or interval trees) to represent time availability, making calculations less prone to errors.\n3.  **Explicit Duration Consideration:** Ensure the code always correctly considers the required duration. A dedicated function `is_slot_available(start_time, duration, schedules)` that explicitly checks availability based on the duration would be beneficial.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Availability Checking Function:** Create a function that takes a start time, duration, and a list of participant schedules as input and returns whether all participants are available during that slot. This will centralize and standardize the availability checking logic.\n2.  **Refine the Slot Selection Algorithm:** Revise the algorithm to explicitly consider the meeting duration. If the duration is one hour, ensure it's looking for a full hour of availability, not just 30 minutes.\n3.  **Add Robustness to Schedule Parsing:** Use a dedicated library for handling time ranges and availability.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 2:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 3:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 5:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 6:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 9:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a consistent pattern:\n\n*   **Correct Initial Extraction:** The \"Extracted Details\" section, validated as \"COMPLETE,\" accurately captures participants, duration, days, work hours, and individual schedules. This demonstrates strong information extraction capabilities.\n*   **Flawed Availability Reasoning:** The \"Available Slots\" analysis consistently makes incorrect claims about participant availability. This is the core problem. For example, in Sample 2, it states, \"They both are free from 9:00-10:00. Therefore, 9:00-9:30 and 9:30-10:00 are options,\" despite no mention of Jennifer schedule availability between 9:00 and 10:00.\n*   **Duration Confusion:** As highlighted in the Error Analysis Report, the system sometimes reverts to thinking in terms of 30-minute slots even when the required duration is different.\n*   **Final Answer Mirroring:** The \"Final Answer\" often simply repeats the flawed reasoning presented in the \"Available Slots\" section, indicating a lack of independent verification or error correction.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system has a solid foundation in information extraction and constraint recognition, but its core reasoning and scheduling logic is fundamentally flawed. It consistently fails to correctly determine available time slots based on the extracted schedule data.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-agent system driven by LLM calls to schedule meetings. It decomposes the problem into constraint extraction, schedule extraction, data verification, and available time finding using `extract_meeting_constraints`, `extract_participant_schedules`, `verify_extracted_data`, and `find_available_time` functions, respectively. The overall workflow involves sequentially calling these functions, with `main` coordinating the process and returning a proposed meeting time or an error message. The LLM is used to extract relevant information and reason about the availability of time slots.",

      "text_report": "## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The prompt is well-defined, providing clear instructions and context for the LLM.\n2.  The task setup (scheduling meetings with constraints) is a relevant and complex problem-solving scenario.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system consistently fails to extract meeting constraints, resulting in \"Error: Could not extract meeting constraints.\" This suggests a fundamental flaw in the information extraction process.\n2.  The system lacks robustness and struggles with various phrasing and structures used to describe participant schedules and meeting constraints.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The inability to reliably extract meeting constraints from the provided text is the primary bottleneck. The LLM relies on this extraction as the foundation of the entire solution.\n2.  **Parsing of Temporal Information:** The system needs to effectively parse and interpret the different formats used to express time intervals and days of the week. It seems brittle and unable to adapt to slight variations in phrasing.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent \"Could not extract meeting constraints\" error:** This points to a systemic issue with the parsing and extraction logic. The LLM cannot interpret the schedules of the participants, meeting duration, and other constraints.\n2.  **Failure to handle variations in phrasing:** The examples showcase slight variations in how schedules and constraints are presented (e.g., \"9:00 to 17:00\" vs. \"9:00 - 17:00\", different wording for blocked calendars). The system struggles to handle these variations.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure of the information_extraction module to correctly parse and structure the input text containing participant schedules and meeting constraints.** The LLM does not seem able to deal with the nuances of the phrasing used to describe availability.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the information_extraction module's ability to parse participant schedules, meeting durations, and meeting time preferences from the text.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** Even if information extraction works, ensure the system can represent and manipulate constraints related to time.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Re-architect Information Extraction with LLM Calls:**  Instead of relying on rigid regular expressions, employ LLM calls to identify and extract relevant information.  For example, create specialized LLM functions like:\n    ```python\n    def extract_schedules(text):\n        \"\"\"Extracts participant schedules from the input text using LLM.\"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"Extract the schedules of all participants from the following text, returning a structured format with participant name, day, start time, and end time:\\n\\n{text}\"\n        # Call the LLM\n        response = call_llm(prompt)\n        # Parse the LLM's response (which should be a structured format like JSON)\n        return parse_schedule_from_llm(response)\n\n    def extract_meeting_constraints(text):\n        \"\"\"Extracts meeting constraints like duration, days, and time restrictions using LLM.\"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"Extract the meeting constraints, including duration, allowed days, and time restrictions, from the following text:\\n\\n{text}\"\n        response = call_llm(prompt)\n        return parse_constraints_from_llm(response)\n    ```\n2.  **Chain-of-Thought Information Extraction:** Break down information extraction into multiple steps with LLM reasoning:\n    *   Step 1: Identify all participants.\n    *   Step 2: For each participant, identify their blocked times on each day.\n    *   Step 3: Identify meeting duration, preferred days, and time range.\n    *   Step 4: Combine all extracted information into a structured format.\n    Each step uses an LLM call to perform that part of the reasoning.\n\n3.  **Implement Error Detection and Handling within Information Extraction:**  Add LLM-driven checks after each extraction step to verify the completeness and correctness of extracted information. If errors are detected, trigger a re-extraction attempt with refined instructions.\n\n4.  **Verification Agent for Extracted Constraints**: A separate agent should receive the extracted information and use LLM reasoning to verify that it is consistent, complete and makes sense. If not, it should flag the information to be re-extracted.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information_extraction, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample 3:** information_extraction, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample 4:** information_extraction, constraint_handling\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe current AI system demonstrates a **very limited capability** in solving meeting scheduling problems. While the prompt structure is well-defined and the task is relevant, the system's inability to reliably extract meeting constraints renders it effectively non-functional. The system's dependence on brittle parsing methods severely limits its ability to generalize across slight variations in input phrasing. The overall capability is currently extremely low and requires significant improvements to be practically useful.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Prompt Structure:** The prompt provides clear instructions and context. This is a positive foundation to build upon.\n2.  **Task Relevance:** The meeting scheduling task is a practical and complex problem that aligns with real-world use cases.\n3. **LLM Model Potential:** The underlying LLM model has the *potential* to be a strength, if properly leveraged for information extraction and reasoning, as opposed to relying on regex.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Failure:** The system consistently fails to accurately extract meeting constraints, rendering the entire process ineffective. This is the most critical weakness.\n2.  **Brittle Parsing Logic:** The system relies on rigid parsing methods (likely regex-based) that are unable to adapt to variations in input phrasing, leading to frequent errors.\n3. **Lack of Error Handling**: The code does not handle errors well, causing the whole process to fail. The error handling must be improved to catch these errors and retry using a different strategy.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. The system *must* reliably extract meeting constraints to function. All other improvements are contingent upon addressing this core weakness.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Re-architect Information Extraction with LLM Calls:**  Completely replace the existing parsing logic with LLM-driven information extraction. Implement the suggested `extract_schedules(text)` and `extract_meeting_constraints(text)` functions, ensuring they return structured data (e.g., JSON). Do not use RegEx.\n    *   **Example:** Instead of: `match = re.search(r\"schedule a meeting for (.*?) for\", line)`\n    *   Use: `llm_response = call_llm(f\"Extract the participants from this sentence: '{line}'\")` followed by parsing the *LLM response*, not a regex match object.\n\n2.  **Implement Chain-of-Thought Information Extraction:** Decompose the information extraction process into multiple sequential steps, using LLM calls for each step. This provides more control and opportunities for error detection. As described previously, the steps are:\n    *   Identify all participants.\n    *   For each participant, identify their blocked times on each day.\n    *   Identify meeting duration, preferred days, and time range.\n    *   Combine all extracted information into a structured format.\n\n3.  **Add Verification Agent for Extracted Constraints**: Implement a separate verification agent that receives the structured information from the extraction process and uses LLM reasoning to verify that the extracted information is consistent, complete, and makes sense within the context of the original problem statement. This agent should flag any inconsistencies or omissions to trigger re-extraction attempts.\n\n4.  **Robust Error Handling**: Wrap LLM calls within `try...except` blocks and log any errors encountered. Implement retry logic with slightly modified prompts in case of failures. The code should also handle empty extractions gracefully.\n\n5. **LLM-Based Parsing:** Any parsing of the LLM output should itself be done by the LLM. For example, after asking the LLM to extract a participant list, ask the LLM to put them into a CSV format so it can be more reliably parsed.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **declining**. The system's consistent failure to extract information indicates a fundamental flaw that needs immediate attention. Without significant changes, the system will remain non-functional. The move towards LLM-driven solutions is crucial to reverse this trend.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The prompt is well-defined, providing clear instructions and context for the LLM.\n2.  The task setup (scheduling meetings with constraints) is a relevant and complex problem-solving scenario.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system consistently fails to extract meeting constraints, resulting in \"Error: Could not extract meeting constraints.\" This suggests a fundamental flaw in the information extraction process.\n2.  The system lacks robustness and struggles with various phrasing and structures used to describe participant schedules and meeting constraints.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The inability to reliably extract meeting constraints from the provided text is the primary bottleneck. The LLM relies on this extraction as the foundation of the entire solution.\n2.  **Parsing of Temporal Information:** The system needs to effectively parse and interpret the different formats used to express time intervals and days of the week. It seems brittle and unable to adapt to slight variations in phrasing.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent \"Could not extract meeting constraints\" error:** This points to a systemic issue with the parsing and extraction logic. The LLM cannot interpret the schedules of the participants, meeting duration, and other constraints.\n2.  **Failure to handle variations in phrasing:** The examples showcase slight variations in how schedules and constraints are presented (e.g., \"9:00 to 17:00\" vs. \"9:00 - 17:00\", different wording for blocked calendars). The system struggles to handle these variations.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure of the information_extraction module to correctly parse and structure the input text containing participant schedules and meeting constraints.** The LLM does not seem able to deal with the nuances of the phrasing used to describe availability.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the information_extraction module's ability to parse participant schedules, meeting durations, and meeting time preferences from the text.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** Even if information extraction works, ensure the system can represent and manipulate constraints related to time.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Re-architect Information Extraction with LLM Calls:**  Instead of relying on rigid regular expressions, employ LLM calls to identify and extract relevant information.  For example, create specialized LLM functions like:\n    ```python\n    def extract_schedules(text):\n        \"\"\"Extracts participant schedules from the input text using LLM.\"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"Extract the schedules of all participants from the following text, returning a structured format with participant name, day, start time, and end time:\\n\\n{text}\"\n        # Call the LLM\n        response = call_llm(prompt)\n        # Parse the LLM's response (which should be a structured format like JSON)\n        return parse_schedule_from_llm(response)\n\n    def extract_meeting_constraints(text):\n        \"\"\"Extracts meeting constraints like duration, days, and time restrictions using LLM.\"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"Extract the meeting constraints, including duration, allowed days, and time restrictions, from the following text:\\n\\n{text}\"\n        response = call_llm(prompt)\n        return parse_constraints_from_llm(response)\n    ```\n2.  **Chain-of-Thought Information Extraction:** Break down information extraction into multiple steps with LLM reasoning:\n    *   Step 1: Identify all participants.\n    *   Step 2: For each participant, identify their blocked times on each day.\n    *   Step 3: Identify meeting duration, preferred days, and time range.\n    *   Step 4: Combine all extracted information into a structured format.\n    Each step uses an LLM call to perform that part of the reasoning.\n\n3.  **Implement Error Detection and Handling within Information Extraction:**  Add LLM-driven checks after each extraction step to verify the completeness and correctness of extracted information. If errors are detected, trigger a re-extraction attempt with refined instructions.\n\n4.  **Verification Agent for Extracted Constraints**: A separate agent should receive the extracted information and use LLM reasoning to verify that it is consistent, complete and makes sense. If not, it should flag the information to be re-extracted.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information_extraction, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample 3:** information_extraction, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample 4:** information_extraction, constraint_handling\n",

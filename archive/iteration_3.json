  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-agent approach to schedule meetings, leveraging LLMs for data extraction, constraint checking, and time suggestion. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow by calling `extract_data` to get structured data, `check_constraints` to verify the data's validity, and `suggest_meeting_time` to propose a meeting time. These agent functions use chain-of-thought reasoning with examples to guide the LLM's output via calls to the `call_llm` function, with an appropriate prompt and system instruction for each agent. The overall workflow is `main` -> (`extract_data` -> `call_llm`) -> (`check_constraints` -> `call_llm`) -> (`suggest_meeting_time` -> `call_llm`).",

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several key issues:\n\n*   **Incorrect Schedule Synthesis:** Even when the reasoning seems correct in the initial steps, the system makes errors in identifying truly free slots when considering all participants. For example, in the first sample, the reasoning states \"9:00-9:30: Carol is free, Mark is busy\", but it should immediately disqualify this time slot.\n*   **Constraint Violation:** The third sample demonstrates a clear violation of the \"Kathleen prefers before 14:30\" constraint by initially suggesting 14:30-15:00 and then seemingly arbitrarily choosing 10:30-11:00.\n*   **Inconsistent Prioritization:** While the reasoning mentions Kathleen's preference, it doesn't consistently prioritize or enforce it.\n*   **Day Selection Logic:** The error analysis notes issues with earliest availability on days spanning multiple days. The provided execution outputs do not contain such a scenario, but it is worth noting for later analysis.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system shows promise in understanding the basic elements of the scheduling problem: identifying participants, extracting schedule constraints, and recognizing the need for a universally available slot. However, its core capability of synthesizing schedules and adhering to constraints is severely flawed, resulting in near-zero accuracy. The reasoning steps are present, but the logic within those steps is often incorrect.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Ability to extract relevant information from the problem statements.\n*   **Identification of Individual Availability:** Ability to determine potential time slots based on single-participant availability.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Inaccurate constraint handling, particularly when synthesizing schedules for multiple participants.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Ineffective verification process; the LLM fails to critically evaluate proposed solutions against all constraints.\n*   **Decision Making:** Inconsistent prioritization of constraints, particularly \"earliest availability\" and preferred times.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most critical capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**. The system cannot accurately synthesize schedules to determine universally available time slots that meet all given constraints.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Hybrid Approach:**\n    *   **Deterministic Schedule Synthesis:** Represent schedules as sets of time intervals in Python. Use set operations (intersection, union, difference) to accurately determine available slots for all participants.\n    *   **LLM Analysis and Prioritization:** The LLM analyzes the results of this deterministic calculation, applies preferred constraints (Kathleen's preference), and selects the *earliest* available time.\n\n2.  **Create a Dedicated Solution Verifier Agent:**\n    *   This agent meticulously checks potential solutions against all constraints.\n    *   The agent provides specific feedback to the solution generation agent on any violations.\n    *   This agent uses the deterministic schedule representation.\n\n3.  **Prompt Refinement (Emphasis on Earliest):**\n    *   Rephrase the prompt to explicitly emphasize the absolute importance of selecting the *earliest* available time slot *after* ensuring all hard constraints are met.\n    *   Provide examples in the prompt of how to correctly prioritize earliest availability.\n\n4.  **Implement Multi-Stage Verification Process:**\n    *   **Stage 1 (Schedule Validation):** LLM proposes a time.\n    *   **Stage 2 (Conflict Check - Deterministic):** Python function checks for hard conflicts using the participant schedules. If conflicts exist, *reject immediately*.\n    *   **Stage 3 (Preference Check - LLM):** LLM evaluates if preferred constraints are met.\n    *   **Stage 4 (Earliest Check - LLM):** LLM verifies this is the earliest possible meeting time that meets all prior criteria. If not, select earlier, or reject.\n\n5.  **Address Inconsistent Reasoning Patterns:**\n    *   **Few-Shot Examples:** Add few-shot examples to the prompt that demonstrate correct constraint handling and prioritization, focusing on complex scenarios with multiple participants and conflicting schedules. Ensure that the provided examples showcase multiple time slots where some, but not all constraints are met, and demonstrate how the system should proceed in these situations.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy of 0.00 and the consistent error patterns across the sample outputs, the capabilities are currently **stable but critically deficient**. Without significant intervention, the system will likely continue to perform poorly. The proposed changes aim to move the system towards a **rapid improvement** in the next iteration.\n",

For example, in the first sample, the reasoning states \"9:00-9:30: Carol is free, Mark is busy\", but it should immediately disqualify this time slot.\n*   **Constraint Violation:** The third sample demonstrates a clear violation of the \"Kathleen prefers before 14:30\" constraint by initially suggesting 14:30-15:00 and then seemingly arbitrarily choosing 10:30-11:00.\n*   **Inconsistent Prioritization:** While the reasoning mentions Kathleen's preference, it doesn't consistently prioritize or enforce it.\n*   **Day Selection Logic:** The error analysis notes issues with earliest availability on days spanning multiple days. The provided execution outputs do not contain such a scenario, but it is worth noting for later analysis.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system shows promise in understanding the basic elements of the scheduling problem: identifying participants, extracting schedule constraints, and recognizing the need for a universally available slot. However, its core capability of synthesizing schedules and adhering to constraints is severely flawed, resulting in near-zero accuracy. The reasoning steps are present, but the logic within those steps is often incorrect.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Ability to extract relevant information from the problem statements.\n*   **Identification of Individual Availability:** Ability to determine potential time slots based on single-participant availability.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Inaccurate constraint handling, particularly when synthesizing schedules for multiple participants.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Ineffective verification process; the LLM fails to critically evaluate proposed solutions against all constraints.\n*   **Decision Making:** Inconsistent prioritization of constraints, particularly \"earliest availability\" and preferred times.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most critical capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**. The system cannot accurately synthesize schedules to determine universally available time slots that meet all given constraints.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Hybrid Approach:**\n    *   **Deterministic Schedule Synthesis:** Represent schedules as sets of time intervals in Python. Use set operations (intersection, union, difference) to accurately determine available slots for all participants.\n    *   **LLM Analysis and Prioritization:** The LLM analyzes the results of this deterministic calculation, applies preferred constraints (Kathleen's preference), and selects the *earliest* available time.\n\n2.  **Create a Dedicated Solution Verifier Agent:**\n    *   This agent meticulously checks potential solutions against all constraints.\n    *   The agent provides specific feedback to the solution generation agent on any violations.\n    *   This agent uses the deterministic schedule representation.\n\n3.  **Prompt Refinement (Emphasis on Earliest):**\n    *   Rephrase the prompt to explicitly emphasize the absolute importance of selecting the *earliest* available time slot *after* ensuring all hard constraints are met.\n    *   Provide examples in the prompt of how to correctly prioritize earliest availability.\n\n4.  **Implement Multi-Stage Verification Process:**\n    *   **Stage 1 (Schedule Validation):** LLM proposes a time.\n    *   **Stage 2 (Conflict Check - Deterministic):** Python function checks for hard conflicts using the participant schedules. If conflicts exist, *reject immediately*.\n    *   **Stage 3 (Preference Check - LLM):** LLM evaluates if preferred constraints are met.\n    *   **Stage 4 (Earliest Check - LLM):** LLM verifies this is the earliest possible meeting time that meets all prior criteria. If not, select earlier, or reject.\n\n5.  **Address Inconsistent Reasoning Patterns:**\n    *   **Few-Shot Examples:** Add few-shot examples to the prompt that demonstrate correct constraint handling and prioritization, focusing on complex scenarios with multiple participants and conflicting schedules. Ensure that the provided examples showcase multiple time slots where some, but not all constraints are met, and demonstrate how the system should proceed in these situations.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy of 0.00 and the consistent error patterns across the sample outputs, the capabilities are currently **stable but critically deficient**. Without significant intervention, the system will likely continue to perform poorly. The proposed changes aim to move the system towards a **rapid improvement** in the next iteration.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using an LLM to extract constraints, propose a meeting time, and verify the proposed solution. It decomposes the problem into three LLM-driven stages: constraint extraction, time proposal, and solution verification. Each stage uses a specialized LLM agent, guided by system instructions and few-shot examples, to perform its task.\n\nThe workflow starts with `main(question)` and uses: \n1. `extract_meeting_constraints(question)` which extracts meeting constraints from a question.\n2. `propose_meeting_time(constraints_json)` to propose a meeting time based on the extracted constraints.\n3. `verify_solution(question, proposed_time)` which verifies if the proposed meeting time is valid based on the question. \n4. `call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None)` which is used by the other functions to communicate with the LLM.",

This leaves the following available slots for Cheryl on Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-15:00, and 15:30-16:00.\n\nConsidering Charles' preference to avoid meetings after 15:30, let's evaluate the available slots:\n- Monday: 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, 15:00-15:30\n- Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00.\n\nTherefore, here is the proposed time: Monday, 10:30 - 11:00\n\nVerification result: Constraint 1: Meeting is for Charles and Cheryl. Met.\nConstraint 2: Meeting is half an hour. Met.\nConstraint 3: Meeting is between 9:00 and 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. Met.\nConstraint 4: Charles is available. Met.\nConstraint 5: Cheryl is available. Met.\nConstraint 6: Charles does not want to meet on Monday. It is on Monday, NOT Met.\nConstraint 7: Charles does not want to meet after 15:30 on Tuesday. Met.\nVerification: The proposed time does not satisfy all requirements.\n\nANSWER_START\nLet's think step by step. We need to find a 30-minute slot where both Charles and Cheryl are available on either Monday or Tuesday, between 9:00 and 17:00. Charles is available the entire time, but prefers to avoid meetings after 15:30. Cheryl has several busy slots.\n\nOn Monday, Cheryl is busy from 9:00-10:30, 11:00-12:30, 13:00-15:00, and 15:30-17:00. This leaves the following available slots for Cheryl on Monday: 10:30-11:00 and 12:30-13:00 and 15:00-15:30.\nOn Tuesday, Cheryl is busy from 9:30-10:00, 10:30-11:00, 11:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 15:00-15:30, and 16:00-17:00. This leaves the following available slots for Cheryl on Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-15:00, and 15:30-16:00.\n\nConsidering Charles' preference to avoid meetings after 15:30, let's evaluate the available slots:\n- Monday: 10:30-11:00, 12:30-13:00, 15:00-15:30\n- Tuesday: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-10:30, 11:00-11:30, 13:00-13:30, 14:00-15:00, 15:30-16:00.\n\nTherefore, here is the proposed time: Monday, 10:30 - 11:00\n\nANSWER_END\n",

We need to find a 30-minute slot where all six participants are available, taking into account their existing schedules. Kayla prefers not to meet before 10:30.\n\nLet's examine each participant's availability on Monday:\n\n*   **Charles:** Available all day.\n*   **Kayla:** Busy from 12:00-13:00. Also, prefers not to meet before 10:30.\n*   **Cynthia:** Available all day.\n*   **Rebecca:** Busy from 10:00-10:30, 12:00-14:00, 14:30-15:00, 15:30-16:00, and 16:30-17:00.\n*   **Randy:** Busy from 10:00-11:30, 12:00-13:30, 14:30-15:30, and 16:00-17:00.\n*   **Hannah:** Busy from 9:00-9:30, 10:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-15:30, and 16:30-17:00.\n\nNow, let's find an available slot:\n\n*   **9:30-10:00:** Hannah is busy until 9:30, and Randy and Rebecca are busy later. So, this won't work.\n*   **10:30-11:00:** Randy is busy until 11:30, so this won't work.\n*   **11:30-12:00:** Rebecca, Randy, and Hannah are busy later. Kayla prefers after 10:30, so this works for her. Charles and Cynthia are free too.\n*   **13:30-14:00:** Rebecca is busy from 12:00-14:00. Hannah is also busy from 13:30-14:00.\n\nTherefore, the best option is 11:30-12:00.\n\nProposed Time: Here is the proposed time: Monday, 11:30 - 12:00\n\nANSWER_END\n",

Specifically:\n\n*   **Constraint Extraction:** The system consistently extracts constraints into a JSON format. However, the format is sometimes verbose including the \"Let's think step by step\" preface.\n*   **Availability Analysis Errors:** The outputs clearly show errors in availability analysis. The reasoning often identifies correct free slots but also misses valid slots or incorrectly flags slots as busy, as seen in Sample ID 5 and 9.\n*   **Verification Errors:** The verification step often incorrectly validates solutions that violate constraints. For example, in sample ID 0, the system suggests Monday when Charles prefers not to meet on Monday but incorrectly labels the solution as meeting all criteria.\n*   **Reasoning Verbosity:** The outputs include unnecessary conversational elements (\"Let's think step by step\") throughout the reasoning process, suggesting inefficiencies and a lack of targeted, concise processing.\n*   **Duplication:** The presence of ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END tags, along with the entire reasoning being repeated inside those tags, suggests an unnecessary duplication of work. The LLM seems to be repeating the entire reasoning process again within the tags, rather than just providing the final answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic capabilities in constraint extraction, availability analysis, and solution verification. However, the accuracy and reliability of these capabilities are insufficient for practical application. The system struggles to consistently make correct decisions based on the extracted constraints and available time slots, frequently leading to incorrect or suboptimal solutions. The core issue lies in the *reliability* of the LLM's reasoning.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Constraint Extraction:** The ability to extract constraints from natural language input and represent them in a structured format.\n*   **Structured Approach:** The attempt to follow a structured problem-solving process involving constraint extraction, availability analysis, and solution verification. This structure is crucial for maintaining a systematic approach.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Availability Analysis Accuracy:** The most critical weakness is the inconsistent and often incorrect determination of available time slots.\n*   **Constraint-Aware Decision Making:** The system struggles to synthesize all constraints, including preferences, into a valid and optimal solution.\n*   **Ineffective Verification:** The verification process fails to reliably identify constraint violations.\n*   **Unnecessary Verbosity and Duplication:** The LLM's reasoning is verbose and repetitive, indicating a lack of efficiency.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Availability Analysis Accuracy**. Improving the reliability of this capability will have the greatest positive impact on overall system performance.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Hybrid Approach for Availability Analysis:** Replace the LLM-driven availability analysis with a deterministic Python function. This function should:\n    *   Take the extracted schedules (structured as lists of time intervals) as input.\n    *   Calculate available time slots using precise time arithmetic.\n    *   Return the available time slots as a structured list of time intervals.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        import datetime\n\n        def get_available_slots(schedule, duration_minutes, start_time, end_time):\n            \"\"\"\n            Calculates available time slots from a schedule.\n\n            Args:\n                schedule: A list of tuples representing busy slots (start_time, end_time),\n                          where start_time and end_time are datetime.time objects.\n                duration_minutes: The duration of the required slot in minutes.\n                start_time: Earliest start time for the meeting\n                end_time: Latest end time for the meeting\n\n            Returns:\n                A list of tuples representing available slots (start_time, end_time).\n            \"\"\"\n\n            available_slots = []\n            # Convert start and end times to datetime objects for comparison\n            current_time = datetime.datetime.combine(datetime.date.today(), start_time)\n            end_datetime = datetime.datetime.combine(datetime.date.today(), end_time)\n\n            # Sort schedule by start time\n            schedule.sort()\n            last_available_time = current_time\n\n            for busy_start_time, busy_end_time in schedule:\n                busy_start = datetime.datetime.combine(datetime.date.today(), busy_start_time)\n                busy_end = datetime.datetime.combine(datetime.date.today(), busy_end_time)\n                # Check if there is a gap between the current time and the start of the busy slot\n                if busy_start > last_available_time:\n                    # Calculate the duration of the gap\n                    time_difference = busy_start - last_available_time\n                    # Check if the gap is long enough for the meeting\n                    if time_difference.total_seconds() >= duration_minutes * 60:\n                        available_slots.append((last_available_time.time(), busy_start.time()))\n                # Update last_available_time to the end of the busy slot for next iteration\n                last_available_time = max(last_available_time, busy_end)\n\n            # After iterating through all busy slots, check for remaining time until the end_time\n            if end_datetime > last_available_time:\n                time_difference = end_datetime - last_available_time\n                if time_difference.total_seconds() >= duration_minutes * 60:\n                    available_slots.append((last_available_time.time(), end_datetime.time()))\n\n            return available_slots\n        ```\n\n2.  **Refine Constraint Extraction Prompt:** Revise the constraint extraction prompt to:\n    *   Explicitly request a structured JSON output, free of conversational text.\n    *   Include examples of the desired JSON format.\n    *   Remove the \"Let's think step by step\" preface from the prompt.\n    *   Focus the LLM on extracting the *relevant* information and structuring it correctly.\n\n3.  **Two-Pass Verification and Iterative Refinement:** Implement a two-pass verification process:\n    *   **Pass 1:**  Deterministic check of individual availability using the `get_available_slots` function.\n    *   **Pass 2:** LLM-based verification of all other constraints (duration, time window, preferences).\n\n    If verification fails:\n    *   Use the specific error messages from both passes to guide the LLM in refining the solution.\n    *   Implement a loop with a `max_attempts` limit to iteratively refine the solution based on verification feedback.\n\n4.  **Remove Duplication:**  Modify the solution generation process to avoid repeating the entire reasoning process within the ANSWER\\_START/ANSWER\\_END tags. The LLM should only generate the *final answer* within these tags.\n\n5.  **Simplify Verification Prompt:** Focus the LLM verification prompt on *specific* constraints, instead of asking it to re-solve the entire problem. Provide the proposed solution and ask it to verify that the solution meets each constraint.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy of 0.60 and the identified weaknesses, the capabilities are currently **stable but insufficient**. The proposed improvements are expected to lead to a significant **improvement** in accuracy and reliability in the next iteration.\n",

This function should:\n    *   Take the extracted schedules (structured as lists of time intervals) as input.\n    *   Calculate available time slots using precise time arithmetic.\n    *   Return the available time slots as a structured list of time intervals.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        import datetime\n\n        def get_available_slots(schedule, duration_minutes, start_time, end_time):\n            \"\"\"\n            Calculates available time slots from a schedule.\n\n            Args:\n                schedule: A list of tuples representing busy slots (start_time, end_time),\n                          where start_time and end_time are datetime.time objects.\n                duration_minutes: The duration of the required slot in minutes.\n                start_time: Earliest start time for the meeting\n                end_time: Latest end time for the meeting\n\n            Returns:\n                A list of tuples representing available slots (start_time, end_time).\n            \"\"\"\n\n            available_slots = []\n            # Convert start and end times to datetime objects for comparison\n            current_time = datetime.datetime.combine(datetime.date.today(), start_time)\n            end_datetime = datetime.datetime.combine(datetime.date.today(), end_time)\n\n            # Sort schedule by start time\n            schedule.sort()\n            last_available_time = current_time\n\n            for busy_start_time, busy_end_time in schedule:\n                busy_start = datetime.datetime.combine(datetime.date.today(), busy_start_time)\n                busy_end = datetime.datetime.combine(datetime.date.today(), busy_end_time)\n                # Check if there is a gap between the current time and the start of the busy slot\n                if busy_start > last_available_time:\n                    # Calculate the duration of the gap\n                    time_difference = busy_start - last_available_time\n                    # Check if the gap is long enough for the meeting\n                    if time_difference.total_seconds() >= duration_minutes * 60:\n                        available_slots.append((last_available_time.time(), busy_start.time()))\n                # Update last_available_time to the end of the busy slot for next iteration\n                last_available_time = max(last_available_time, busy_end)\n\n            # After iterating through all busy slots, check for remaining time until the end_time\n            if end_datetime > last_available_time:\n                time_difference = end_datetime - last_available_time\n                if time_difference.total_seconds() >= duration_minutes * 60:\n                    available_slots.append((last_available_time.time(), end_datetime.time()))\n\n            return available_slots\n        ```\n\n2.  **Refine Constraint Extraction Prompt:** Revise the constraint extraction prompt to:\n    *   Explicitly request a structured JSON output, free of conversational text.\n    *   Include examples of the desired JSON format.\n    *   Remove the \"Let's think step by step\" preface from the prompt.\n    *   Focus the LLM on extracting the *relevant* information and structuring it correctly.\n\n3.  **Two-Pass Verification and Iterative Refinement:** Implement a two-pass verification process:\n    *   **Pass 1:**  Deterministic check of individual availability using the `get_available_slots` function.\n    *   **Pass 2:** LLM-based verification of all other constraints (duration, time window, preferences).\n\n    If verification fails:\n    *   Use the specific error messages from both passes to guide the LLM in refining the solution.\n    *   Implement a loop with a `max_attempts` limit to iteratively refine the solution based on verification feedback.\n\n4.  **Remove Duplication:**  Modify the solution generation process to avoid repeating the entire reasoning process within the ANSWER\\_START/ANSWER\\_END tags. The LLM should only generate the *final answer* within these tags.\n\n5.  **Simplify Verification Prompt:** Focus the LLM verification prompt on *specific* constraints, instead of asking it to re-solve the entire problem. Provide the proposed solution and ask it to verify that the solution meets each constraint.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy of 0.60 and the identified weaknesses, the capabilities are currently **stable but insufficient**. The proposed improvements are expected to lead to a significant **improvement** in accuracy and reliability in the next iteration.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using an LLM to extract relevant details from a question using a ReAct-like chain-of-thought approach. The extracted information is then parsed and used to find available time slots, which are subsequently verified by the LLM. The overall workflow involves `main` calling `extract_scheduling_details`, `parse_extracted_details`, `find_available_time_slots_programmatic`, `verify_time_slot_solution`, and `format_answer`. The `call_llm` function is used by `extract_scheduling_details` and `verify_time_slot_solution` to interface with the LLM.",

There are no variations, no attempts to extract or process information \u2013 just the default message. This indicates a system that halts immediately upon encountering the need for this core functionality.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the system possesses *extremely limited* capability. It can acknowledge the need for a meeting schedule, but it fundamentally lacks the ability to perform the task. The presence of the placeholder message suggests some understanding of the problem, but the *complete absence* of functional code to solve it renders the system practically useless.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Awareness of Task:** The system recognizes the intent to schedule a meeting.\n2.  **Placeholder Response:** The placeholder message indicates that the system is aware of a missing component.\n\nThese strengths are minimal and overshadowed by the significant weaknesses.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Missing Core Algorithm:** The complete absence of a time slot finding algorithm.\n2.  **Zero Functionality:** The system provides no meaningful output or progress towards solving the scheduling problem.\n3.  **Lack of Information Extraction:** Inability to parse and process participant schedules, constraints, or any other relevant data from the input.\n4. **Failure to handle even simple cases**: The current system can't generate any valid time slots at all.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Solution Generation** (Implementing the time slot finding algorithm). Without this, the system is non-functional.  All other potential improvements are dependent on having a basic solution generation capability.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Basic Time Slot Finding Logic**:\n    *   Create a function (e.g., `find_time_slot(schedules, duration, constraints)`) that takes participant schedules, desired meeting duration, and any constraints as input.\n    *   This function should iterate through potential time slots (e.g., in 30-minute increments within standard work hours).\n    *   For each time slot, check if *all* participants are available and if the time slot satisfies the constraints.\n    *   Return the first available time slot found, or `None` if no time slot meets the criteria. Start with implementing *simplest* constraints (e.g. all attendees free, time between 9am-5pm), and then *gradually increase complexity* as the system starts to function.\n    *    If no meeting time can be found, provide a message.\n\n2.  **Create Sample Schedules**: To properly test the new time slot finding function, it will need some schedules:\n    * Create a test fixture that creates schedules.\n    * e.g. `create_test_schedules()`\n\n3. **Unit Tests**: Create unit tests to test your time slot finding function. This way you can make sure that it provides a valid time slot.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining**: With an accuracy of 0.00, the system is currently non-functional. Without implementing at least the most basic solution generation capability, the system will continue to be completely ineffective.\n```",

There are no variations, no attempts to extract or process information \u2013 just the default message. This indicates a system that halts immediately upon encountering the need for this core functionality.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the system possesses *extremely limited* capability. It can acknowledge the need for a meeting schedule, but it fundamentally lacks the ability to perform the task. The presence of the placeholder message suggests some understanding of the problem, but the *complete absence* of functional code to solve it renders the system practically useless.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Awareness of Task:** The system recognizes the intent to schedule a meeting.\n2.  **Placeholder Response:** The placeholder message indicates that the system is aware of a missing component.\n\nThese strengths are minimal and overshadowed by the significant weaknesses.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Missing Core Algorithm:** The complete absence of a time slot finding algorithm.\n2.  **Zero Functionality:** The system provides no meaningful output or progress towards solving the scheduling problem.\n3.  **Lack of Information Extraction:** Inability to parse and process participant schedules, constraints, or any other relevant data from the input.\n4. **Failure to handle even simple cases**: The current system can't generate any valid time slots at all.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Solution Generation** (Implementing the time slot finding algorithm). Without this, the system is non-functional.  All other potential improvements are dependent on having a basic solution generation capability.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Basic Time Slot Finding Logic**:\n    *   Create a function (e.g., `find_time_slot(schedules, duration, constraints)`) that takes participant schedules, desired meeting duration, and any constraints as input.\n    *   This function should iterate through potential time slots (e.g., in 30-minute increments within standard work hours).\n    *   For each time slot, check if *all* participants are available and if the time slot satisfies the constraints.\n    *   Return the first available time slot found, or `None` if no time slot meets the criteria. Start with implementing *simplest* constraints (e.g. all attendees free, time between 9am-5pm), and then *gradually increase complexity* as the system starts to function.\n    *    If no meeting time can be found, provide a message.\n\n2.  **Create Sample Schedules**: To properly test the new time slot finding function, it will need some schedules:\n    * Create a test fixture that creates schedules.\n    * e.g. `create_test_schedules()`\n\n3. **Unit Tests**: Create unit tests to test your time slot finding function. This way you can make sure that it provides a valid time slot.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining**: With an accuracy of 0.00, the system is currently non-functional. Without implementing at least the most basic solution generation capability, the system will continue to be completely ineffective.\n```"

  "approach_summary": "This script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by first extracting information from the problem statement, then finding an available time slot, and finally verifying the proposed solution. It decomposes the problem into three distinct steps: information extraction, time slot finding, and solution verification, each handled by a separate LLM call with embedded examples. The workflow leverages LLMs to perform the complex reasoning and decision-making required for scheduling, simulating specialized agents for each stage.",

However, Danielle doesn't want to meet on Thursday, so we can eliminate that day.\n\n2. **Preference for earliest availability:** We should prioritize earlier time slots.\n\n3. **Monday:**\n    *   Danielle: 9:00-9:30, 10:00-11:00, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-17:00\n    *   Amanda: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30, 15:00-15:30\n    *   Common slots: 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 12:00-12:30\n    *   Earliest option on Monday: 9:00-9:30.

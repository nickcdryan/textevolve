  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by extracting information, identifying available time slots, proposing a time, and verifying the solution. It decomposes the problem into four main steps, each handled by a dedicated function that acts as a specific agent. The functions `extract_meeting_info`, `identify_available_time_slots`, `propose_meeting_time`, and `verify_final_solution` work together sequentially to extract the relevant details, analyze participant schedules, propose a meeting time, and confirm that the proposed time adheres to all constraints, with `call_llm` being used by each agent to make calls to the LLM. The overall workflow involves sequentially using LLM calls with specific instructions to extract data from the input question, find available time slots, propose the best time, and verify the proposed time.",

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Cheryl, Bryan, Joseph, Maria, Elizabeth and Kimberly for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nCheryl has meetings on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBryan has meetings on Monday during 11:30 to 12:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nJoseph's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nMaria has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nElizabeth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: "

It only evaluates *whether* a \"proposed time\" (unstated) works. It never actually states *what* the proposed time is.\n*   **Output Format Inconsistency:** The system's output primarily focuses on explaining why a \"proposed time\" works or doesn't, rather than stating what the proposed time is, deviating from the desired output format (stating the proposed time explicitly).\n*   **Implicit \"Proposed Time\":** The system refers to \"the proposed time,\" but this is never actually stated in its own response. This is a critical gap in its reasoning process.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Missing Solution Generation Step:** The primary bottleneck is the absence of a clear solution generation process. The system seems to be operating on an implicit, unstated proposed meeting time, preventing it from reliably providing a concrete solution.\n*   **Lack of Direct Answer Output:** The system fails to output a direct and explicit answer in the required format (\"Here is the proposed time: ...\"). Its focus on explaining the constraints results in missing the core task requirement.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Explanation Instead of Solution:** The dominant pattern is that the system provides explanations of why a proposed time works or doesn't, but omits the actual proposed time from its answer.\n*   **Deviation from Golden Answer Format:** The system consistently fails to adhere to the \"Here is the proposed time: ...\" format.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure to explicitly generate and state the \"proposed time\"** in the output. The system's reasoning focuses on constraint checking of an *implicit* solution, but it never verbalizes this proposed solution. This leads to incomplete and unusable answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Solution Generation:** Implement a mechanism for the system to actively generate candidate meeting times based on the constraints.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Enforce a strict output format that includes the explicit statement of the proposed meeting time.\n*   **Reasoning Step Sequencing:** Re-sequence the reasoning steps to ensure that solution generation *precedes* constraint verification and explanation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement ReAct Pattern (Solution Generation Focus):** Modify the solution generation process using the ReAct (Reason-Act-Observe) pattern. The agent should Reason about the constraints, Act by proposing a candidate meeting time, Observe the conflicts (if any), and Repeat until a valid solution is found.\n*   **Prompt Engineering (Explicit Output Format):** Revise the prompt to explicitly request that the system output the proposed meeting time in the format \"Here is the proposed time: [Time]\". Provide examples in the prompt that strictly adhere to this format.\n*   **Verification Agent (Format Enforcement):** Introduce a verification agent that checks the system's output for adherence to the required format. If the format is incorrect, the output is rejected and re-processed with specific feedback on the formatting issue.\n*   **Multi-Stage Generation (Content then Format):** Use multi-stage generation.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the findings of the error analysis. The system consistently *explains* whether a \"proposed time\" works, based on the given constraints. However, it *never explicitly states* what that \"proposed time\" actually is. This makes the outputs virtually useless, as the user is left guessing what the system is evaluating.\n\nThe outputs also demonstrate a clear deviation from the desired format \"Here is the proposed time: ...\". This isn't just a formatting issue; it's a fundamental failure to address the core task of proposing a meeting time. The lack of any timestamps further shows this failure.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system demonstrates a limited understanding of the task's core requirements. It can parse participant schedules and apply constraints, but it cannot *generate* a valid meeting time or even *state* the time it's evaluating. Thus it is severely lacking the core solution generation capability.\n\nOverall, the system is currently ineffective, indicated by low accuracy score (0.20). While constraint handling is a relative strength, the absence of a solution generation mechanism renders this capability practically useless.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Correctly identifying and applying constraints from participant schedules. It needs to do so with a concrete solution.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Missing Solution Generation:** The system's inability to generate and state a proposed meeting time is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Format Non-Compliance:** Consistent failure to adhere to the required output format.\n*   **Lack of Explicit Solution:** The system fails to provide an explicit solution.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\n*   **Solution Generation:** The primary focus *must* be on enabling the system to generate candidate meeting times and explicitly state them in its output.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nGiven the fundamental flaws in the existing approach, I recommend a **complete overhaul** focusing on the following:\n\n1.  **Implement ReAct Pattern with Explicit Time Generation:**\n\n    *   **Reason:** Analyze the participant schedules and constraints.\n    *   **Act:** *Propose* a specific candidate meeting time. The prompt must clearly instruct the LLM to **state the time**.\n    *   **Observe:** Check if the proposed time conflicts with any participant's schedule.\n    *   **Repeat:** If conflicts exist, modify the proposed time and repeat until a conflict-free solution is found or a maximum number of attempts is reached.\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve_with_react_time_generation(problem, max_iterations=10):\n        \"\"\"\n        Solves the problem using ReAct pattern with explicit time generation.\n        \"\"\"\n        system_instruction = \"\"\"You are scheduling expert and you need to schedule a meeting according to participant schedules.\n        Follow the ReAct pattern: Reason, Act, Observe.\n        For each action, use the specific format.\"\"\"\n\n        context = f\"\"\"\n        Let's schedule a meeting for the following participants: {problem}\n\n        Thought 1: Let's start by finding a potential meeting time.

Examples should be diverse in terms of the actual time proposed.\n    *   Add negative examples demonstrating incorrect output format to illustrate what *not* to do.\n\n3.  **Implement a Verification Agent (Format and Validity Check):**\n\n    *   Create a separate agent that checks the output of the main solution agent.\n    *   The verification agent should specifically check:\n        *   Presence of the \"Here is the proposed time: [Time]\" string.\n        *   Validity of the proposed time (doesn't conflict with any schedules).\n    *   If either check fails, the verification agent should provide specific feedback to the main agent, instructing it to correct the output.\n\n4.  **Capability Mapping Refinement:**\n     * Refine the system to be able to do the proper capability mapping using solution generation and output formatting.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nThe current trend is **stable and poor**. Without significant changes, the system will continue to fail at the core task. The recommended actions represent a fundamental shift in approach, and success will depend on effective implementation and iterative refinement.\n",

It only evaluates *whether* a \"proposed time\" (unstated) works. It never actually states *what* the proposed time is.\n*   **Output Format Inconsistency:** The system's output primarily focuses on explaining why a \"proposed time\" works or doesn't, rather than stating what the proposed time is, deviating from the desired output format (stating the proposed time explicitly).\n*   **Implicit \"Proposed Time\":** The system refers to \"the proposed time,\" but this is never actually stated in its own response. This is a critical gap in its reasoning process.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Missing Solution Generation Step:** The primary bottleneck is the absence of a clear solution generation process. The system seems to be operating on an implicit, unstated proposed meeting time, preventing it from reliably providing a concrete solution.\n*   **Lack of Direct Answer Output:** The system fails to output a direct and explicit answer in the required format (\"Here is the proposed time: ...\"). Its focus on explaining the constraints results in missing the core task requirement.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Explanation Instead of Solution:** The dominant pattern is that the system provides explanations of why a proposed time works or doesn't, but omits the actual proposed time from its answer.\n*   **Deviation from Golden Answer Format:** The system consistently fails to adhere to the \"Here is the proposed time: ...\" format.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure to explicitly generate and state the \"proposed time\"** in the output. The system's reasoning focuses on constraint checking of an *implicit* solution, but it never verbalizes this proposed solution. This leads to incomplete and unusable answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Solution Generation:** Implement a mechanism for the system to actively generate candidate meeting times based on the constraints.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Enforce a strict output format that includes the explicit statement of the proposed meeting time.\n*   **Reasoning Step Sequencing:** Re-sequence the reasoning steps to ensure that solution generation *precedes* constraint verification and explanation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement ReAct Pattern (Solution Generation Focus):** Modify the solution generation process using the ReAct (Reason-Act-Observe) pattern. The agent should Reason about the constraints, Act by proposing a candidate meeting time, Observe the conflicts (if any), and Repeat until a valid solution is found.\n*   **Prompt Engineering (Explicit Output Format):** Revise the prompt to explicitly request that the system output the proposed meeting time in the format \"Here is the proposed time: [Time]\". Provide examples in the prompt that strictly adhere to this format.\n*   **Verification Agent (Format Enforcement):** Introduce a verification agent that checks the system's output for adherence to the required format. If the format is incorrect, the output is rejected and re-processed with specific feedback on the formatting issue.\n*   **Multi-Stage Generation (Content then Format):** Use multi-stage generation. In the first stage, the system focuses on identifying a valid meeting time. In the second stage, it formats the answer according to the required template.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (No proposed time)\n    *   output formatting: Failed (Deviation from required format)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (No proposed time)\n    *   output formatting: Failed (Deviation from required format)\n*   **Sample 3:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (No proposed time)\n    *   output formatting: Failed (Deviation from required format)\n*   **Sample 4:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (No proposed time)\n    *   output formatting: Failed (Deviation from required format)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the findings of the error analysis. The system consistently *explains* whether a \"proposed time\" works, based on the given constraints. However, it *never explicitly states* what that \"proposed time\" actually is. This makes the outputs virtually useless, as the user is left guessing what the system is evaluating.\n\nThe outputs also demonstrate a clear deviation from the desired format \"Here is the proposed time: ...\". This isn't just a formatting issue; it's a fundamental failure to address the core task of proposing a meeting time. The lack of any timestamps further shows this failure.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system demonstrates a limited understanding of the task's core requirements. It can parse participant schedules and apply constraints, but it cannot *generate* a valid meeting time or even *state* the time it's evaluating. Thus it is severely lacking the core solution generation capability.\n\nOverall, the system is currently ineffective, indicated by low accuracy score (0.20). While constraint handling is a relative strength, the absence of a solution generation mechanism renders this capability practically useless.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Correctly identifying and applying constraints from participant schedules. It needs to do so with a concrete solution.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Missing Solution Generation:** The system's inability to generate and state a proposed meeting time is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Format Non-Compliance:** Consistent failure to adhere to the required output format.\n*   **Lack of Explicit Solution:** The system fails to provide an explicit solution.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\n*   **Solution Generation:** The primary focus *must* be on enabling the system to generate candidate meeting times and explicitly state them in its output.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nGiven the fundamental flaws in the existing approach, I recommend a **complete overhaul** focusing on the following:\n\n1.  **Implement ReAct Pattern with Explicit Time Generation:**\n\n    *   **Reason:** Analyze the participant schedules and constraints.\n    *   **Act:** *Propose* a specific candidate meeting time. The prompt must clearly instruct the LLM to **state the time**.\n    *   **Observe:** Check if the proposed time conflicts with any participant's schedule.\n    *   **Repeat:** If conflicts exist, modify the proposed time and repeat until a conflict-free solution is found or a maximum number of attempts is reached.\n\n    For example:\n\n    ```python\n    def solve_with_react_time_generation(problem, max_iterations=10):\n        \"\"\"\n        Solves the problem using ReAct pattern with explicit time generation.\n        \"\"\"\n        system_instruction = \"\"\"You are scheduling expert and you need to schedule a meeting according to participant schedules.\n        Follow the ReAct pattern: Reason, Act, Observe.\n        For each action, use the specific format.\"\"\"\n\n        context = f\"\"\"\n        Let's schedule a meeting for the following participants: {problem}\n\n        Thought 1: Let's start by finding a potential meeting time. We need to consider all participants' schedules.\n        Action 1: PROPOSE TIME [9:00]\n\n        \"\"\"\n\n        full_trace = context\n\n        for i in range(max_iterations):\n           response = call_llm(full_trace, system_instruction)\n           full_trace += response + \"\\n\"\n           if \"Action\" in response and \"FINISH\" in response:\n               final_answer = response.split(\"FINISH [\")[1].split(\"]\")[0]\n               validation_prompt = f\"\"\"Given participants and the current schedules: {problem}. Is the generated time correct?\n               {full_trace}\n               If the time is correct, respond with: CORRECT. Other wise respond: INCORRECT:\n               \"\"\"\n               validation = call_llm(validation_prompt)\n               if validation.startswith(\"CORRECT\"):\n                   return final_answer\n               elif validation.startswith(\"INCORRECT\"):\n                  continue\n\n           if \"Action\" in response and \"PROPOSE TIME\" in response:\n                calculation = response.split(\"PROPOSE TIME [\")[1].split(\"]\")[0]\n                observation = f\"Observation {i+1}: Proposed Time: {calculation}. Is this time free?\"\n                full_trace += observation + \"\\n\\nThought \" + str(i+2) + \":\"\n                continue\n    ```\n\n2.  **Prompt Engineering (Explicit Output Format Enforcement):**\n\n    *   Revise the prompt to *insist* on the \"Here is the proposed time: [Time]\" format.\n    *   Provide multiple examples in the prompt that *strictly* adhere to this format. Examples should be diverse in terms of the actual time proposed.\n    *   Add negative examples demonstrating incorrect output format to illustrate what *not* to do.\n\n3.  **Implement a Verification Agent (Format and Validity Check):**\n\n    *   Create a separate agent that checks the output of the main solution agent.\n    *   The verification agent should specifically check:\n        *   Presence of the \"Here is the proposed time: [Time]\" string.\n        *   Validity of the proposed time (doesn't conflict with any schedules).\n    *   If either check fails, the verification agent should provide specific feedback to the main agent, instructing it to correct the output.\n\n4.  **Capability Mapping Refinement:**\n     * Refine the system to be able to do the proper capability mapping using solution generation and output formatting.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nThe current trend is **stable and poor**. Without significant changes, the system will continue to fail at the core task. The recommended actions represent a fundamental shift in approach, and success will depend on effective implementation and iterative refinement.\n"

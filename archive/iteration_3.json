  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions by decomposing the problem into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. Each stage leverages an LLM with a specific role (e.g., question analyzer, passage extractor) to perform its task. The functions used are `main`, `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, `verify_answer`, and `call_llm`; `main` orchestrates the process, calling the other functions sequentially to analyze the question, extract relevant information, generate an answer, and verify its correctness, using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model at each stage. The overall workflow involves analyzing the question, retrieving relevant information, forming an initial answer, and then verifying the answer for accuracy.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: In 1616 the Venetians besieged Farra and Gradisca, and the archduke attacked from Gorizia and Lucinico. With three large culverins, four guns and three small culverins, Farra  repulsed the enemy artillery with heavy losses. The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano. In September, Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 . Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships and on land by the war in Mantua. Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj.\n\nQUESTION: How many Dutch and English warships were blocking Spanish support?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: On a windy, rainy Sunday the Seahawks hosted the Rams looking to take an effective 3 game lead in the division with a win. The Seahawks drove the ball easily on their first possession, moving to the Ram 1-yard line. After a false start penalty, Seneca Wallace was sacked and fumbled, and the Rams returned the ball 89 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks drove down the field again, this time maintaining possession to the endzone as Darrell Jackson caught a 3-yard TD pass. The lead would change hands 6 more times in the game. With the Rams holding a 16-14 lead in the fourth quarter, Rams coach Scott Linehan chose to challenge a call, nullifying a field goal. The challenge was upheld, but the Rams still faced a fourth down play. Instead of kicking another field goal to increase the lead, Linehan chose to go for a first down. The raucous Qwest Field rose to the occasion, and Rams FB Paul Smith could not hear the play call. Rather than run a pass route he stayed in the backfield to block, and Ram QB Marc Bulger's pass to double covered TE Klopfenstein fell incomplete. Nate Burleson returned a punt 90 yards for a touchdown and a 21-16 lead. After a Rams TD with 2:37 remaining, a series of penalties against St. Louis changed momentum. A holding penalty nullified a successful 2 point convert. The second attempt failed. A 15-yard personal foul was assessed on the subsequent kickoff, and Josh Scobey returned the ball to the Ram 49-yard line. With a short field and time on the clock, Seneca Wallace and Maurice Morris drove the Seahawks to the Ram 20-yard line, where Josh Brown kicked a game-winning field goal with 9 seconds remaining.

While the Texans defense held off the Steelers' offense, the offense managed to gain much-needed momentum in the 1st quarter, a place they had previously struggled. The Texans scored first with 5:55 left after Blue caught a pass from Fitzpatrick to lead 7-0. In the second quarter Ben Roethlisberger was sacked by Watt and fumbled the ball near midfield. Houston capitalized on the turnover with a Bullock 39 yard field goal to lead 10-0 with 13:39 left in the 2nd. Houston continued their trend of scoring on each possession with another Bullock field goal (38 yards) to extend their lead to 13-0 with 7:20 left; part of the same drive included the Texans converting on a 4th down and inches.

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Livonian War  was fought for control of Old Livonia , when the Tsardom of Russia faced a varying coalition of Denmark-Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Union  of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. During the period 1558-1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat  and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland-Lithuania.

The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada, and were given the choice of:  remain and accept baptism,  reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or  be exiled. Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them. Therefore, only a decade after the fall of the Emirate of Granada, the entire Muslim population of Granada had nominally become Christian.

Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies.

The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano.

Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino.

The Seahawks drove the ball easily on their first possession, moving to the Ram 1-yard line. After a false start penalty, Seneca Wallace was sacked and fumbled, and the Rams returned the ball 89 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks drove down the field again, this time maintaining possession to the endzone as Darrell Jackson caught a 3-yard TD pass. The lead would change hands 6 more times in the game. With the Rams holding a 16-14 lead in the fourth quarter, Rams coach Scott Linehan chose to challenge a call, nullifying a field goal. The challenge was upheld, but the Rams still faced a fourth down play. Instead of kicking another field goal to increase the lead, Linehan chose to go for a first down. The raucous Qwest Field rose to the occasion, and Rams FB Paul Smith could not hear the play call. Rather than run a pass route he stayed in the backfield to block, and Ram QB Marc Bulger's pass to double covered TE Klopfenstein fell incomplete. Nate Burleson returned a punt 90 yards for a touchdown and a 21-16 lead. After a Rams TD with 2:37 remaining, a series of penalties against St. Louis changed momentum.

During the period 1558-1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat  and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland-Lithuania.

      "original_passage": "By the end of 1501, the rebellion was put down. The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada, and were given the choice of:  remain and accept baptism,  reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or  be exiled. Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them. Therefore, only a decade after the fall of the Emirate of Granada, the entire Muslim population of Granada had nominally become Christian. A proclamation in 1502 extended these forced conversions to the rest of the lands of Castile, even though those outside Granada had nothing to do with the rebellion. The newly converted Muslims were known as nuevos cristianos  or moriscos . Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies. Many secretly practiced Islam, even as they publicly professed and practiced Christianity. In return, the Catholic rulers adopted increasingly intolerant and harsh policies in order to eradicate these characteristics. This culminated in Philip II's Pragmatica of 1 January 1567 which ordered the Moriscos to abandon their customs, clothing and language. The pragmatica triggered the Morisco revolts in 1568-1571.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**SYSTEM:** AI System (Unnamed)\n\n**VERSION:** [Insert Version Number Here]\n\n**DATE:** October 26, 2023\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.70 (7/10)\n*   Error samples: 3/10\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs confirm several key issues identified in the error analysis:\n\n*   **Implicit Answers (\"Correct\"):** The first output (\"Correct.\") directly illustrates the issue of providing implicit answers when a more specific answer is expected. Based on the other analysis, it's likely this corresponds to a question where the system *should* have extracted a specific piece of information from the text.\n*   **Partial Extraction:** The second output (\"12 Dutch and 10 English\") *appears* correct in isolation but needs to be considered within the context of the full error analysis (Sample ID 1). The weakness reported is that the system extracts these values but fails to sum them. This demonstrates a capability for extracting numerical values.\n*   **Numerical extraction:** The third output (\"3\") appears correct and corresponds with the system's strength regarding Numerical Value Identification.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates moderate capability in information extraction and basic reasoning. It can identify and extract key pieces of information from the text, including numerical values. However, its overall effectiveness is significantly hampered by its inability to perform necessary calculations and its tendency to provide implicit rather than explicit answers. The system also struggles with percentage-related questions.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Reliably extracts factual information directly present in the input text.\n*   **Numerical Value Identification:** Accurately identifies and extracts numerical data.\n*   **Simple Reasoning:** Capable of basic contextual understanding and implicit conveyance of information.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning (Aggregation, Percentage Calculation):** Fails to perform necessary arithmetic operations to derive answers. This is a critical performance bottleneck.\n*   **Explicit Answer Generation:** Frequently provides \"Correct\" as an answer when the question demands specific, extracted information.\n*   **Inconsistent Question Understanding:** Shows a deficiency in recognizing all numerical information related to answering the question.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Arithmetic Reasoning, particularly aggregation and percentage calculation**, combined with a robust mechanism for providing **explicit answers.**  Addressing these weaknesses will have the most significant impact on overall accuracy and usability.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Calculation Trigger and Module:**\n    *   **Detailed Action:** Develop a module dedicated to performing calculations. This module should be triggered by specific keywords or question structures (e.g., \"total,\" \"sum,\" \"what is the sum,\" \"percentage,\" \"how many in total,\" etc.). The trigger should be intelligent enough to distinguish between situations where a simple lookup is sufficient versus when a calculation is required.\n    *   **Implementation Details:**\n        *   The trigger could be implemented as a set of regular expressions or a rule-based system.\n        *   The calculation module should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations.\n        *   Implement unit tests to ensure the calculation module functions correctly for all supported operations.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Explicit Answers in Answer Generation:**\n    *   **Detailed Action:** Refactor the answer generation logic to *always* prioritize providing extracted or derived information over a simple \"Correct.\" Introduce a check to see if the question anticipates a factual response, and if so, *force* the system to search for a relevant passage/answer.\n    *   **Implementation Details:**\n        *   Implement a scoring mechanism that penalizes implicit answers.\n        *   Create a whitelist of questions that are genuinely boolean (yes/no) and allow \"Correct\" only for those questions.\n        *   If an explicit answer *cannot* be found after a thorough search, *then* consider providing an implicit answer, but flag this as a potential error for review.\n\n3.  **Enhance Percentage Detection and Calculation:**\n    *   **Detailed Action:**  Improve the system's ability to identify questions requiring percentage calculations. Implement specific logic to identify keywords like \"percent,\" \"percentage,\" \"out of,\" and understand the relationship between the values involved.\n    *   **Implementation Details:**\n        *   Develop a separate function specifically for handling percentage calculations, including identifying the base value and the percentage to be calculated.\n        *   Add extensive unit tests to cover different percentage-related scenarios.\n        *   Incorporate error handling to prevent division by zero or other invalid calculations.\n\n4.  **Capability Mapping Review:**\n    *   **Detailed Action:** Thoroughly review the capability mapping process and ensure it accurately reflects the system's strengths and weaknesses. Refine the mapping to provide more granular insights into specific areas of success and failure.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance and error analysis, the system's capabilities are currently **stable** with room for improvement. While the system exhibits core strengths in information extraction, the identified weaknesses prevent it from consistently achieving high accuracy. Implementing the recommendations above will likely lead to an **improving** capability trend.\n",

Additionally the system often provides \"Correct\" as answers even when more specific information is expected.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Arithmetic Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to identify and perform simple arithmetic operations.\n2.  **Answer Generation:** Ensure the system always provides the most explicit and complete answer possible, not just an implicit \"Correct.\"\n3.  **Percentage Calculation:** Improve the logic for recognizing when percentage calculations are needed and correctly identifying the inputs.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Introduce a Calculation Module:** Implement a dedicated module that is triggered when the question suggests a need for arithmetic operations. This module should be able to identify the necessary values, perform the calculation, and format the result into the answer.\n2.  **Post-Processing of Extracted Information:** After extracting information, add a post-processing step to check for keywords or question structures that indicate the need for aggregation or other calculations.\n3.  **Explicit Answer Prioritization:** Modify the answer generation logic to prioritize providing explicit answers extracted or derived from the text over simple confirmations like \"Correct.\" Implement a rule that the system must attempt to provide a specific answer before resorting to \"Correct,\" and only allow \"Correct\" for questions that require a true/false or yes/no answer.\n4.  **Enhance Percentage Logic:** Re-evaluate the system's approach to percentages. Implement explicit steps that look for keywords like \"percent,\" \"percentage,\" or \"out of\" and then perform the appropriate calculations.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction (partially failed: extracted individual values but didn't aggregate), solution_generation (failed), solution_verification (failed).\n*   **Sample ID 6:** solution_generation (failed), solution_verification (failed).\n*   **Sample ID 7:** information_extraction (failed), solution_generation (failed), solution_verification (failed).\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**SYSTEM:** AI System (Unnamed)\n\n**VERSION:** [Insert Version Number Here]\n\n**DATE:** October 26, 2023\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.70 (7/10)\n*   Error samples: 3/10\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs confirm several key issues identified in the error analysis:\n\n*   **Implicit Answers (\"Correct\"):** The first output (\"Correct.\") directly illustrates the issue of providing implicit answers when a more specific answer is expected. Based on the other analysis, it's likely this corresponds to a question where the system *should* have extracted a specific piece of information from the text.\n*   **Partial Extraction:** The second output (\"12 Dutch and 10 English\") *appears* correct in isolation but needs to be considered within the context of the full error analysis (Sample ID 1). The weakness reported is that the system extracts these values but fails to sum them. This demonstrates a capability for extracting numerical values.\n*   **Numerical extraction:** The third output (\"3\") appears correct and corresponds with the system's strength regarding Numerical Value Identification.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates moderate capability in information extraction and basic reasoning. It can identify and extract key pieces of information from the text, including numerical values. However, its overall effectiveness is significantly hampered by its inability to perform necessary calculations and its tendency to provide implicit rather than explicit answers. The system also struggles with percentage-related questions.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Reliably extracts factual information directly present in the input text.\n*   **Numerical Value Identification:** Accurately identifies and extracts numerical data.\n*   **Simple Reasoning:** Capable of basic contextual understanding and implicit conveyance of information.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning (Aggregation, Percentage Calculation):** Fails to perform necessary arithmetic operations to derive answers. This is a critical performance bottleneck.\n*   **Explicit Answer Generation:** Frequently provides \"Correct\" as an answer when the question demands specific, extracted information.\n*   **Inconsistent Question Understanding:** Shows a deficiency in recognizing all numerical information related to answering the question.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Arithmetic Reasoning, particularly aggregation and percentage calculation**, combined with a robust mechanism for providing **explicit answers.**  Addressing these weaknesses will have the most significant impact on overall accuracy and usability.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Calculation Trigger and Module:**\n    *   **Detailed Action:** Develop a module dedicated to performing calculations. This module should be triggered by specific keywords or question structures (e.g., \"total,\" \"sum,\" \"what is the sum,\" \"percentage,\" \"how many in total,\" etc.). The trigger should be intelligent enough to distinguish between situations where a simple lookup is sufficient versus when a calculation is required.\n    *   **Implementation Details:**\n        *   The trigger could be implemented as a set of regular expressions or a rule-based system.\n        *   The calculation module should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations.\n        *   Implement unit tests to ensure the calculation module functions correctly for all supported operations.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Explicit Answers in Answer Generation:**\n    *   **Detailed Action:** Refactor the answer generation logic to *always* prioritize providing extracted or derived information over a simple \"Correct.\" Introduce a check to see if the question anticipates a factual response, and if so, *force* the system to search for a relevant passage/answer.\n    *   **Implementation Details:**\n        *   Implement a scoring mechanism that penalizes implicit answers.\n        *   Create a whitelist of questions that are genuinely boolean (yes/no) and allow \"Correct\" only for those questions.\n        *   If an explicit answer *cannot* be found after a thorough search, *then* consider providing an implicit answer, but flag this as a potential error for review.\n\n3.  **Enhance Percentage Detection and Calculation:**\n    *   **Detailed Action:**  Improve the system's ability to identify questions requiring percentage calculations. Implement specific logic to identify keywords like \"percent,\" \"percentage,\" \"out of,\" and understand the relationship between the values involved.\n    *   **Implementation Details:**\n        *   Develop a separate function specifically for handling percentage calculations, including identifying the base value and the percentage to be calculated.\n        *   Add extensive unit tests to cover different percentage-related scenarios.\n        *   Incorporate error handling to prevent division by zero or other invalid calculations.\n\n4.  **Capability Mapping Review:**\n    *   **Detailed Action:** Thoroughly review the capability mapping process and ensure it accurately reflects the system's strengths and weaknesses. Refine the mapping to provide more granular insights into specific areas of success and failure.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance and error analysis, the system's capabilities are currently **stable** with room for improvement. While the system exhibits core strengths in information extraction, the identified weaknesses prevent it from consistently achieving high accuracy. Implementing the recommendations above will likely lead to an **improving** capability trend.\n"

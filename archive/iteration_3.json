  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using the Gemini LLM to analyze training examples and apply the learned transformation to a test input. It decomposes the problem into two main steps: analyzing the transformation pattern and applying the transformation. Two LLM-driven functions with different prompts are used: `analyze_transformation_pattern` (identifies the transformation pattern from training examples using chain-of-thought reasoning) and `apply_transformation` (applies the identified pattern to the test input using chain-of-thought reasoning).\n\nThe functions used are `main` (orchestrates the entire process), `analyze_transformation_pattern` (extracts transformation patterns), `apply_transformation` (applies the transformation to the test input), and `call_llm` (interacts with the Gemini LLM). The `main` function extracts the training examples and test input strings then calls the other functions. `analyze_transformation_pattern` and `apply_transformation` both use `call_llm` to generate a response from the Gemini model, which are then returned to main. The overall workflow involves parsing the input question, analyzing the transformation pattern using the LLM, applying the transformation to the test input using the LLM, and returning the transformed grid.",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the issues identified in the error analysis. The system consistently fails to produce valid outputs according to the underlying transformation patterns.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output grid contains a sparse pattern of `0` and `17` that bears no relation to any possible transformation of a typical input grid.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The output grid is a repeating pattern of \"7, 3, 7\". This is also an arbitrary transformation that cannot be derived from simple grid manipulation.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** While the system correctly identifies unique numbers in the input grid, it then creates an output filled with rows of repeating unique numbers. This deviates significantly from the training examples' underlying pattern. The attempt to describe the process (\"let's construct the output grid...\") is disconnected from the actual code output, highlighting a reasoning gap.\n\nThe consistent generation of unrelated and nonsensical patterns across all samples indicates a fundamental flaw in the system's approach to pattern recognition and generalization. The system's attempt to explain the logic behind the generated output in Sample ID 2 shows that it is generating explanations that are decoupled from the executed code.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates extremely limited capabilities. It struggles to understand and replicate the transformation patterns demonstrated in the training data. While it shows some ability to extract information (identifying unique numbers), this ability is not effectively integrated into a coherent problem-solving strategy. The core capabilities of pattern recognition, abstract reasoning, and constraint handling are severely deficient.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Information Extraction (Limited):** The system can identify some basic elements from the input data (e.g., unique numbers), but this is insufficient for the task.\n*   **Question Understanding (Rudimentary):** The system recognizes that it needs to transform a grid.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system's inability to identify transformation patterns from the training examples is the most significant weakness.\n*   **Abstract Reasoning:** The system cannot understand the underlying relationships between input and output grids.\n*   **Generalization:** The system fails to generalize learned patterns to unseen input data.\n*   **Solution Validation:** There is no evidence that the system attempts to validate its generated solutions against any learned constraints.\n*   **Coherence:** The generated solutions lack coherence with the training data and explanations are disconnected from the execution.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition**.

    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the issues identified in the error analysis. The system consistently fails to produce valid outputs according to the underlying transformation patterns.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output grid contains a sparse pattern of `0` and `17` that bears no relation to any possible transformation of a typical input grid.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The output grid is a repeating pattern of \"7, 3, 7\". This is also an arbitrary transformation that cannot be derived from simple grid manipulation.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** While the system correctly identifies unique numbers in the input grid, it then creates an output filled with rows of repeating unique numbers. This deviates significantly from the training examples' underlying pattern. The attempt to describe the process (\"let's construct the output grid...\") is disconnected from the actual code output, highlighting a reasoning gap.\n\nThe consistent generation of unrelated and nonsensical patterns across all samples indicates a fundamental flaw in the system's approach to pattern recognition and generalization. The system's attempt to explain the logic behind the generated output in Sample ID 2 shows that it is generating explanations that are decoupled from the executed code.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates extremely limited capabilities.

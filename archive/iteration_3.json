  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting and validating meeting information from the input question using the `extract_meeting_info` and `validate_meeting_info` functions with an iterative refinement approach involving the `call_llm` function. It then generates all possible meeting slots using the `generate_meeting_slots` function and filters these slots based on participant schedules using the `filter_slots_with_llm` function, employing an LLM to determine constraint satisfaction and return the best possible slots and return the most desirable slot. The core functions used are `main`, `extract_and_validate_info`, `extract_meeting_info`, `validate_meeting_info`, `generate_meeting_slots`, and `filter_slots_with_llm` to organize, filter, and create the meeting slots.",

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Cheryl, Bryan, Joseph, Maria, Elizabeth and Kimberly for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nCheryl has meetings on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBryan has meetings on Monday during 11:30 to 12:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nJoseph's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nMaria has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nElizabeth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: "

This is the *most* critical bottleneck.

Report specific error messages like `JSONDecodeError`, `TypeError`, and `ValueError` when they occur.\n4.  **Implement a ReAct Pattern for Complex Cases:** For cases with many participants or complex constraints, use a ReAct pattern where the agent first reasons about the constraints, then acts to schedule a meeting, observes the outcome, and reacts to any conflicts or violations. This will provide the system with more flexibility to handle complexity.\n5. **Implement Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Consider using specialized agents for parsing, constraint validation, and solution proposal.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the provided information, formatted as requested:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs are uniformly poor.  Every sample resulted in the same generic error: \"Error extracting or validating meeting information.\" This confirms the critical bottleneck identified in the Error Analysis Report. The system effectively fails *before* it even attempts to generate solutions or verify them. There's no variation in the error, suggesting a fundamental flaw in the initial information processing stage. The lack of specific error messages in the outputs makes it impossible to determine the exact point of failure without further debugging information.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system's overall capabilities are currently extremely limited. While it demonstrates awareness of the problem definition and the need to handle constraints (as indicated in the \"STRENGTHS\" section of the Error Analysis Report), its *execution* capability is essentially non-existent. The system cannot reliably perform even the initial step of extracting relevant information, rendering all subsequent modules (solution generation, verification) useless. It currently has **no functional scheduling capability**.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Understanding (Theoretical):** The system demonstrates a basic understanding of the scheduling problem and the need to consider constraints in its design, as stated in the error analysis. This is a *theoretical* strength because it is never actually demonstrated in practice due to the error.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Extraction (CRITICAL):** The inability to extract and validate meeting information (participant schedules, time constraints, preferences) from the input text. This is the **dominant and most critical weakness**.\n*   **Error Reporting (MAJOR):** The system's error reporting is too generic and doesn't provide sufficient information for debugging.\n*   **Constraint Handling (UNKNOWN):** Although the Error Analysis Report lists Constraint Handling as a weakness, this cannot be definitively assessed until information extraction is functioning.\n*   **Solution Generation & Verification (UNTESTED):** The inability to extract information prevents the solution generation and verification modules from being tested. Their capabilities are completely unknown.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. The system *must* be able to reliably extract participant schedules, time constraints, and preferences from the input text before any other capability can be effectively developed or tested. This is the **essential foundation**.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThese recommendations are prioritized to address the Information Extraction bottleneck:\n\n1.  **Implement an LLM-driven Information Extraction Module with Structured Output and Verification (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **Phase 1:** Design a prompt for the LLM to extract key entities (participants, available days, meeting duration, preferred meeting times, and schedule constraints). Include *multiple* few-shot examples demonstrating various input formats and complexities.\n    *   **Phase 2:** Define a rigid JSON schema for the extracted information. Implement code to validate the LLM's output against this schema.  This JSON schema MUST include all the expected data elements and their data types.\n    *   **Phase 3:** If validation fails, re-prompt the LLM. *Crucially, provide the LLM with the specific validation errors* so it can correct its output. Implement a retry loop (with a `max_attempts` safeguard) to allow the LLM multiple chances to produce valid JSON.\n    *   **Phase 4:** For the prompt, add the system_instruction `You are a precise JSON extractor. Return the exact output of this function with the proper json format`.\n    *   **Phase 5:** For the prompt, add the system_instruction `If the proper information to extract is not found, then return null`.\n2.  **Enhance Error Reporting (HIGH):**\n    *   Log *specific* error messages (e.g., `JSONDecodeError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`) along with the problematic input text and the state of the system at the time of the error.\n    *   Include line numbers where the errors occur.\n    *   Capture the LLM prompt and response for debugging purposes.\n3.  **Input-Dependent Routing (MEDIUM):** Before extraction, roughly assess the complexity of the problem and choose a simpler vs. a more sophisticated extraction approach. If a problem only involves two people with simply \"Mondays and Tuesdays\", use simple logic.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's capability trend is currently **Stable (Non-Functional)**. It consistently fails in the same way. There's no improvement or decline, as it's stuck at a baseline of zero functional capability. The trend will remain stable until the Information Extraction bottleneck is addressed.\n",

This is a *theoretical* strength because it is never actually demonstrated in practice due to the error.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Extraction (CRITICAL):** The inability to extract and validate meeting information (participant schedules, time constraints, preferences) from the input text. This is the **dominant and most critical weakness**.\n*   **Error Reporting (MAJOR):** The system's error reporting is too generic and doesn't provide sufficient information for debugging.\n*   **Constraint Handling (UNKNOWN):** Although the Error Analysis Report lists Constraint Handling as a weakness, this cannot be definitively assessed until information extraction is functioning.\n*   **Solution Generation & Verification (UNTESTED):** The inability to extract information prevents the solution generation and verification modules from being tested. Their capabilities are completely unknown.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. The system *must* be able to reliably extract participant schedules, time constraints, and preferences from the input text before any other capability can be effectively developed or tested. This is the **essential foundation**.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThese recommendations are prioritized to address the Information Extraction bottleneck:\n\n1.  **Implement an LLM-driven Information Extraction Module with Structured Output and Verification (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **Phase 1:** Design a prompt for the LLM to extract key entities (participants, available days, meeting duration, preferred meeting times, and schedule constraints). Include *multiple* few-shot examples demonstrating various input formats and complexities.\n    *   **Phase 2:** Define a rigid JSON schema for the extracted information. Implement code to validate the LLM's output against this schema.  This JSON schema MUST include all the expected data elements and their data types.\n    *   **Phase 3:** If validation fails, re-prompt the LLM. *Crucially, provide the LLM with the specific validation errors* so it can correct its output. Implement a retry loop (with a `max_attempts` safeguard) to allow the LLM multiple chances to produce valid JSON.\n    *   **Phase 4:** For the prompt, add the system_instruction `You are a precise JSON extractor. Return the exact output of this function with the proper json format`.\n    *   **Phase 5:** For the prompt, add the system_instruction `If the proper information to extract is not found, then return null`.\n2.  **Enhance Error Reporting (HIGH):**\n    *   Log *specific* error messages (e.g., `JSONDecodeError`, `TypeError`, `ValueError`) along with the problematic input text and the state of the system at the time of the error.\n    *   Include line numbers where the errors occur.\n    *   Capture the LLM prompt and response for debugging purposes.\n3.  **Input-Dependent Routing (MEDIUM):** Before extraction, roughly assess the complexity of the problem and choose a simpler vs. a more sophisticated extraction approach. If a problem only involves two people with simply \"Mondays and Tuesdays\", use simple logic.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's capability trend is currently **Stable (Non-Functional)**. It consistently fails in the same way. There's no improvement or decline, as it's stuck at a baseline of zero functional capability. The trend will remain stable until the Information Extraction bottleneck is addressed.\n"

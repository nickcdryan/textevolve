Study the examples carefully and explain the transformation logic in plain English.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n    Output Grid:\n    [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]\n    Explanation: Each element in the input grid becomes a diagonal in a larger grid. The new grid has the dimensions number of rows times number of columns of the input grid.\n\n    Example 2:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[2, 8], [8, 2]]\n    Output Grid:\n    [[2, 2, 8, 8], [2, 2, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 2], [8, 8, 2, 2]]\n    Explanation: Each element is expanded to a 2x2 block with the element's value. The new grid has the dimensions number of rows times number of columns of the input grid.\n\n    Example 3:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]\n    Output Grid:\n    [[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]\n    Explanation: The input grid is overlaid onto a grid of zeros; the value of 1 replaces 0; the values of 0 remain as 0.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to solve grid transformation problems. It first extracts the transformation rule from example grids using `call_llm` and an LLM prompt that asks for an explanation. Then, it applies this extracted rule to a new grid, again using `call_llm` and a prompt that includes the extracted rule and requests the transformed grid. Two agent roles are implicitly used: a rule extractor and a rule applier.\n\nThe main function `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation` which orchestrates the rule extraction and application. `solve_grid_transformation` calls `call_llm` to interact with the LLM, passing tailored prompts for rule extraction and grid transformation. `call_llm` is a utility function that sends the prompts to the Gemini API and returns the LLM's response. The workflow involves creating a rule extraction prompt, calling the LLM to extract the rule, creating an application prompt with the extracted rule, calling the LLM to generate the transformed grid, and returning the result.",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**AI System: Grid Transformation System**\n\n**Version:** (Assuming this is the initial version) 1.0\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The generated grid appears to be placing numbers ('4' and '7') seemingly at random, with no clear connection to the input grid. This highlights a complete failure in understanding the intended transformation pattern. The '7' values especially are highly frequent compared to the training examples.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The generated code attempts a simple arithmetic transformation (addition and modulo). While it's syntactically correct, the logic is flawed and doesn't align with any reasonable grid transformation pattern. Furthermore, the output `[[3, 5, 7], [3, 5, 7], [3, 5, 7]]` does not match the code transformation result when manually calculated. This demonstrates a severe disconnect between the code generated and the output it produces, indicating a deeper issue in the system's execution pipeline. The inconsistency also shows the system did not properly apply the logic within `transform_grid`.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The generated grid appears to copy some of the original grid's patterns, but with significant modifications and errors. There's an attempt to maintain some structure, but the numbers are incorrect and the pattern is not consistently applied. This indicates a partial, but ultimately incorrect, pattern recognition capability.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system's overall capability in solving grid transformation problems is **extremely low.** While it demonstrates a basic ability to generate Python code for grid manipulation and rudimentary pattern copying (Sample ID 2), it fundamentally fails to:\n\n*   Understand and extract complex transformation logic from training examples.\n*   Translate extracted patterns into accurate and executable code.\n*   Generalize learned transformation rules to unseen test inputs.\n*   Verify the consistency of the generated output against the intended transformation.\n*   Apply the code it produced to the original input grid.\n\nThe system's accuracy is currently at 33%, reflecting its limited success. The high error rate (66%) confirms the urgent need for significant improvements.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation (Syntactic):** The system can generate syntactically valid Python code for grid manipulation. This provides a foundation to build upon.\n*   **Grid Iteration:** The generated code includes correct implementations of nested loops for iterating through grid rows and columns.\n*   **Basic Pattern Recognition (Limited):** In some cases (Sample ID 2), the system demonstrates a minimal ability to copy some parts of the input grid pattern, although inaccurately.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Extraction and Understanding:** The inability to reliably extract transformation logic from training examples is the most significant weakness.\n*   **Transformation Implementation:** Translating extracted patterns into accurate code is a major challenge. The system relies on simple arithmetic and struggles with conditional logic or spatial reasoning.\n*   **Generalization:** The system's inability to generalize from training examples to the test input renders it almost useless for practical applications.\n*   **Output Consistency:** The inconsistency between the code and its stated output signifies fundamental issues with the execution or output interpretation.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Extraction and Understanding**. Without a robust mechanism for accurately extracting the underlying transformation logic from the training examples, the system will continue to generate incorrect and inconsistent code.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Spatial Relationship Detection:**\n    *   Develop functions to analyze the spatial relationships between cells in the input and output grids (relative positions, adjacency, offsets).\n    *   Experiment with convolution-like operations to detect local patterns and spatial dependencies.\n2.  **Introduce a Rule-Based Transformation Engine:**\n    *   Design a rule-based engine that can translate extracted patterns into explicit transformation rules. This could use a symbolic representation of the transformations.\n    *   Allow the rules to incorporate conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE) to handle different scenarios.\n3.  **Enhance the Code Generation Module:**\n    *   The current code generation can create basic grid manipulation code. Extend it to handle more complex logic such as conditional statements, nested loops based on detected transformation rules, and function calls for modularity.\n    *   Focus on generating code that correctly implements the rules defined by the transformation engine.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are currently **stable but critically low**. Without significant changes, the system will continue to perform poorly. The implemented recommendations should shift the trend toward improvement, but it will require careful implementation and validation.\n",

This indicates a partial, but ultimately incorrect, pattern recognition capability.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system's overall capability in solving grid transformation problems is **extremely low.** While it demonstrates a basic ability to generate Python code for grid manipulation and rudimentary pattern copying (Sample ID 2), it fundamentally fails to:\n\n*   Understand and extract complex transformation logic from training examples.\n*   Translate extracted patterns into accurate and executable code.\n*   Generalize learned transformation rules to unseen test inputs.\n*   Verify the consistency of the generated output against the intended transformation.\n*   Apply the code it produced to the original input grid.\n\nThe system's accuracy is currently at 33%, reflecting its limited success. The high error rate (66%) confirms the urgent need for significant improvements.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation (Syntactic):** The system can generate syntactically valid Python code for grid manipulation. This provides a foundation to build upon.\n*   **Grid Iteration:** The generated code includes correct implementations of nested loops for iterating through grid rows and columns.\n*   **Basic Pattern Recognition (Limited):** In some cases (Sample ID 2), the system demonstrates a minimal ability to copy some parts of the input grid pattern, although inaccurately.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Extraction and Understanding:** The inability to reliably extract transformation logic from training examples is the most significant weakness.\n*   **Transformation Implementation:** Translating extracted patterns into accurate code is a major challenge. The system relies on simple arithmetic and struggles with conditional logic or spatial reasoning.\n*   **Generalization:** The system's inability to generalize from training examples to the test input renders it almost useless for practical applications.\n*   **Output Consistency:** The inconsistency between the code and its stated output signifies fundamental issues with the execution or output interpretation.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Extraction and Understanding**. Without a robust mechanism for accurately extracting the underlying transformation logic from the training examples, the system will continue to generate incorrect and inconsistent code.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Spatial Relationship Detection:**\n    *   Develop functions to analyze the spatial relationships between cells in the input and output grids (relative positions, adjacency, offsets).\n    *   Experiment with convolution-like operations to detect local patterns and spatial dependencies.\n2.  **Introduce a Rule-Based Transformation Engine:**\n    *   Design a rule-based engine that can translate extracted patterns into explicit transformation rules. This could use a symbolic representation of the transformations.\n    *   Allow the rules to incorporate conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE) to handle different scenarios.\n3.  **Enhance the Code Generation Module:**\n    *   The current code generation can create basic grid manipulation code. Extend it to handle more complex logic such as conditional statements, nested loops based on detected transformation rules, and function calls for modularity.\n    *   Focus on generating code that correctly implements the rules defined by the transformation engine.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are currently **stable but critically low**. Without significant changes, the system will continue to perform poorly. The implemented recommendations should shift the trend toward improvement, but it will require careful implementation and validation.\n"

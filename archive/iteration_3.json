  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-based visual pattern recognition to transform a grid, decomposing the problem into identifying a transformation rule from training examples and applying it to a test input. It employs agent roles such as a visual pattern recognition expert, a grid transformer, and a transformation rule expert to identify transformation rules, apply transformations, and verify the results, respectively. The functions used are `main`, `split_question`, `identify_transformation_rule`, `apply_transformation`, and `verify_transformation`; the `main` function orchestrates the process by calling the functions to split the input, identify transformation rules, apply transformations, and verify the results. The overall workflow involves splitting the input question, identifying a transformation rule, applying the rule to the test input, and verifying the transformed grid.",

It consistently returns a placeholder answer instead.\n3.  **Detailed Output:** The system lacks the ability to produce detailed grid transformations, instead always responding with a \"Placeholder Transformed Grid\" message.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Pattern Identification and Implementation:** The inability to decipher patterns from provided examples and translate those patterns into grid transformation logic is the most significant bottleneck.\n2.  **Execution of Transformation Logic:** The core grid manipulation code isn't being executed, leading to the consistent \"Placeholder Transformed Grid\" output.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent Placeholder Response:** Across all error cases, the system generates a \"Placeholder Transformed Grid\" answer, indicating a complete failure in the transformation process.\n2.  **Lack of Numerical Manipulation:** The system avoids any numerical calculations or grid-based operations. This suggests an issue with numerical handling or potentially a default behavior triggered when no transformation logic is implemented or identified.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **absence of implemented grid transformation logic and pattern recognition**. The system parses the input and recognizes the presence of training examples, but fails to extract the transformation pattern and apply it to the test grid.  This results in a hardcoded placeholder response instead of dynamic grid manipulation. It appears there is no functioning algorithm to analyze the example input-output pairs to determine a relationship that can be applied to the test data.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Implement a robust pattern recognition module capable of identifying relationships between the input and output grids in the training examples.\n2.  **Grid Transformation Logic:** Develop a functional grid transformation module to manipulate the test grid based on the identified patterns.\n3.  **Debugging and Intermediate Outputs:** Implement detailed logging and intermediate output capabilities to track the pattern recognition and transformation processes for debugging purposes. Print statements can be easily added to show what steps the system is taking and whether or not the process is working.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** Develop algorithms for finding common differences, additive/multiplicative relationships, or other grid-specific transformations (e.g., mirroring, rotation, transposition) from training examples. This might involve calculating differences between input and output grids, identifying repeating subgrids, or detecting symmetry.\n2.  **Develop Grid Manipulation Functions:** Create a set of functions to manipulate grids: `get_row(grid, row_index)`, `get_col(grid, col_index)`, `set_cell(grid, row_index, col_index, value)`, `create_grid(rows, cols, default_value)`.\n3.  **Implement Logging and Debugging:** Add extensive print statements at each stage of the pattern recognition and transformation process to track the system's progress. For example, print the identified pattern, the transformations being applied, and the state of the grid after each transformation.\n4.  **Iterative Testing:** Start with simpler transformations (e.g., adding a constant to each cell) and gradually increase the complexity as the system's capabilities improve.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to correctly extract the transformation pattern.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate the transformed grid.\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (no solution was generated).\n    *   decision_making: N/A (no valid solution to decide on).\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to correctly extract the transformation pattern.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate the transformed grid.\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (no solution was generated).\n    *   decision_making: N/A (no valid solution to decide on).\n",

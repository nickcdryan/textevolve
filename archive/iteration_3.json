It decomposes the problem into extraction, spatial relationship analysis, transformation, and verification steps. The agent acts as an expert in spatial reasoning. The functions used are `main` which calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which in turn calls `call_llm` to interact with the LLM for each step, extracting information, analyzing relationships, transforming the grid, and verifying the result, with the final transformed grid being returned.",

      "text_report": "Here's a comprehensive capability report for the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**OVERALL PERFORMANCE:** Extremely poor. The system failed to correctly transform the grid in all three test cases (0/3 accuracy).  While information extraction is successful, the core transformation logic is fundamentally flawed.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system attempted to apply spatial relationships (neighboring cell logic). It incorrectly identified a consistent \"4\" around even numbers and \"7\" around odd numbers. It incorrectly tries to fill blank cells with 4 and 7 which is wrong and not in line with the expected behavior.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**  The system correctly identifies a column-wise mapping approach.  However, the code generation is flawed. It introduces a mapping `8:0` without a basis in the example data and then says *\"(since it wasnt available in the provided examples, I set it to 0)\"*, showcasing an attempt to address novel inputs, albeit in an arbitrary and incorrect way. Also, the `col3_map` has the incorrect mapping for 3, and marks 2:6 twice.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** This example exhibits a mix of pattern recognition and hallucination. The system hallucinates transformation rules based on minimal data. The pattern extracted is inaccurate, and the 'neighboring cell influence' applied is not consistent.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses basic capabilities in information extraction and identifying spatial relationships. However, it demonstrates critical weaknesses in pattern recognition, generalization, handling novel inputs, and reliable code generation. The transformations are often incorrect, and the system lacks robustness. It can extract the relevant features from the input/output examples, but often misunderstands the underlying transformation rule.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Consistently successful at extracting relevant information from the input, including grids and examples.\n*   **Attempted Spatial Reasoning:**  The system attempts to identify spatial relationships between the input and the target output.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Fragile Pattern Recognition:** Struggles to generalize transformation rules from limited examples, especially with novel inputs.\n*   **Unreliable Code Generation:** Generated code contains errors (syntax, incorrect variable assignments, logic flaws).\n*   **Poor Novel Input Handling:**  The system poorly handles inputs not seen in the training examples, using arbitrary or incorrect methods to assign a value.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to improve is **Robust Pattern Recognition and Generalization.** Without the ability to accurately identify and apply patterns, all other components become irrelevant.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Pattern Recognition Module with Explicit Novel Input Handling:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Use a combination of rule-based and ML-based approaches.  For example, prioritize identifying simple arithmetic or logical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.). If no simple operation is found, implement a nearest-neighbor lookup for novel inputs based on values in training examples.\n    *   **Specific Change:** Introduce a module *before* code generation that attempts to classify the pattern type (arithmetic, spatial, lookup).  This module should also include a fallback strategy for novel inputs in the lookup category (e.g., assign the most frequent transformation applied to *similar* values in the training examples, or a constant like 0).\n2.  **Improve Code Generation with Static Analysis and Unit Testing:**\n    *   **Recommendation:**  Separate the code generation process into distinct steps: pattern interpretation -> code template selection -> code parameterization.  Implement static analysis to check for syntax errors and type inconsistencies.  Create unit tests that verify the generated code applies the identified pattern correctly to the training examples.\n    *   **Specific Change:** Implement a static code analyzer/linter (e.g., `pylint`, `flake8`) to catch syntax errors in the generated Python code. Write unit tests in `unittest` that use the example input/output pairs to check whether the function produced generates the expected output.\n3.  **Enforce Consistent Spatial Reasoning:**\n    *   **Recommendation:**  In Sample ID 0, the system attempts to apply spatial rules based on neighboring numbers but incorrectly transforms empty cells. We can enhance spatial awareness by defining stricter conditions on where transformations occur.\n    *   **Specific Change:**  Implement a neighbor-checking algorithm that filters cells based on their proximity to existing input values. Use a simple pattern where we check for horizontally or vertically adjacent values. If an adjacent cell exists, the conditional transformation occurs.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are **stable but critically low.** Without significant improvements in pattern recognition, generalization, and code generation, the system will continue to fail. The attempted fixes are arbitrary and not yielding any positive results.\n",

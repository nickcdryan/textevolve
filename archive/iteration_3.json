  "approach_summary": "The script uses a decomposed approach to answer questions by first determining the question type, then extracting relevant information, and finally generating the answer, leveraging the Gemini LLM at each step. It uses a chain-of-thought prompting technique by providing examples to guide the LLM's responses for each subtask. The script employs different \"expert\" roles (question type classifier, information extractor, and answer generator) implemented via system instructions passed to the LLM. The functions used are `main` (orchestrates the process), `determine_question_type` (classifies question type), `extract_relevant_info` (extracts relevant information), `generate_answer` (generates the final answer), and `call_llm` (communicates with the Gemini API); with `main` calling the other functions sequentially to solve the task.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the Battle of Verdun, lasting until December 1916. The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The opening day of the offensive  was the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000. Gun fire wasn't the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides.

      "question": "PASSAGE: War crimes were committed by both sides during the Macedonian struggle. According to a 1900 British report compiled by Alfred Biliotti, who is considered to have heavily relied on Greek intelligence agents, starting from 1897, the members of the Exarchist committees had embarked upon a systematic and extensive campaign of executions of the leading members of the Greek side. Moreover, Bulgarian Komitadjis, pursued a campaign of extermination of Greek and Serbian teachers and clergy. On the other hand, there were attacks by Greek Andartes on many Macedonian Bulgarian villages, with the aim of forcing their inhabitants to switch their allegiance from the Exarchate back to the Patriarchate and accept Greek priest and teachers, but they also carried out massacres against the civilian population, especially in the central parts of Macedonia in 1905 and in 1906. One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani , which was an aggressive pro-Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands. According to British reports on political crimes , during the period from 1897 to 1912 over 4000 political murders were committed , excluding those killed during the Ilinden uprising and the members of the Bulgarian and Greek bands. Of those who were killed, 53% were Bulgarians, 33.5% were Greeks, Serbs and Aromanians together 3.5% and 10% were of an unknown nationality.

The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano.

The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The opening day of the offensive  was the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000. Gun fire wasn't the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. The living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as trench foot, shell shock, blindness/burns from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, cooties  and the \u2018Spanish Flu'.",

According to a 1900 British report compiled by Alfred Biliotti, who is considered to have heavily relied on Greek intelligence agents, starting from 1897, the members of the Exarchist committees had embarked upon a systematic and extensive campaign of executions of the leading members of the Greek side. Moreover, Bulgarian Komitadjis, pursued a campaign of extermination of Greek and Serbian teachers and clergy. On the other hand, there were attacks by Greek Andartes on many Macedonian Bulgarian villages, with the aim of forcing their inhabitants to switch their allegiance from the Exarchate back to the Patriarchate and accept Greek priest and teachers, but they also carried out massacres against the civilian population, especially in the central parts of Macedonia in 1905 and in 1906. One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani , which was an aggressive pro-Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands. According to British reports on political crimes , during the period from 1897 to 1912 over 4000 political murders were committed , excluding those killed during the Ilinden uprising and the members of the Bulgarian and Greek bands. Of those who were killed, 53% were Bulgarians, 33.5% were Greeks, Serbs and Aromanians together 3.5% and 10% were of an unknown nationality.

The numbers 12, 2, and 1 seem to be extracted haphazardly, not related to the underlying problem. The calculation itself is performed correctly, but the inputs are wrong.\n*   **Sample ID 2 (Incorrect Information Extraction):** Again, the system correctly performs the subtraction \"2001 - 1876 = 125 years,\" but it's unrelated to the prompt, which asks for a points calculation based on values from a specific team and quarter. The numbers 2001 and 1876 may have been extracted due to NER concerns, but are of no use in this context.\n*   **Sample ID 3 (Incorrect Information Extraction):** The subtraction itself is valid \"7-6=1\", but it appears unrelated to anything in the prompt, which dealt with the order of events.\n\nThe executions confirm the weaknesses in information extraction and its cascading effect on reasoning. The system can perform arithmetic, but only when it can correctly identify what to perform it on. The errors stem from a failure to properly ground the calculations within the original problem context.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary ability to perform calculations when explicitly provided with numerical values. However, its core capabilities are severely limited by its inability to reliably extract the correct information and apply appropriate reasoning. The system essentially hallucinates numbers and performs arithmetic on them. The system also fails to accurately respond to questions regarding the order of events.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accurate Arithmetic (when input is correct):** The system can perform arithmetic operations correctly if it is given the correct input. This is a basic but essential strength.\n*   **Clear Calculation Display:** The system's display of calculation steps aids in debugging and understanding its process (although it doesn't necessarily mean the process is correct).\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Unreliable Information Extraction:** The system struggles to extract the correct numerical values and entities from the passage. This is the primary bottleneck.\n*   **Flawed Reasoning and Logic Application:** The system often applies incorrect logic or performs irrelevant calculations, even when information is available.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** Fails to understand the context of questions.\n*   **No Temporal Reasoning:** Inability to order events based on a temporal relationship.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **information extraction accuracy and contextual relevance**. Without reliable information extraction, the system's reasoning abilities are rendered useless. The system must extract the correct information before it performs arithmetic, and that information must be relevant to the prompt.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Context-Aware NER:** Enhance Named Entity Recognition (NER) to be context-aware. The NER system should not just identify numbers and entities, but also understand their *role* in the context of the passage and the question. This can be achieved through fine-tuning NER models on question-answering datasets.\n2.  **Develop a Relevance Filter:** Before attempting calculations, implement a relevance filter that evaluates whether the extracted information is relevant to the question being asked. This filter could use techniques like semantic similarity scoring or keyword matching to determine relevance.\n3.  **Implement a question answering module:** Employ machine-learning and deep-learning techniques to determine an answer from the information. A module like this would ingest the prompt and text, and provide an output for the best answer to the given prompt.\n4.  **Prioritize Temporal Reasoning Module:** Implement a module to specifically handle temporal reasoning, which would entail correctly ordering events or identifying values related to time.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, the system's capabilities appear to be **stable but unsatisfactory**. It consistently performs arithmetic correctly *when* it has the correct inputs, but the inputs are almost always wrong. Improvement is needed to make the system more reliable in providing the correct responses.\n",

This is a basic but essential strength.\n*   **Clear Calculation Display:** The system's display of calculation steps aids in debugging and understanding its process (although it doesn't necessarily mean the process is correct).\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Unreliable Information Extraction:** The system struggles to extract the correct numerical values and entities from the passage. This is the primary bottleneck.\n*   **Flawed Reasoning and Logic Application:** The system often applies incorrect logic or performs irrelevant calculations, even when information is available.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** Fails to understand the context of questions.\n*   **No Temporal Reasoning:** Inability to order events based on a temporal relationship.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **information extraction accuracy and contextual relevance**. Without reliable information extraction, the system's reasoning abilities are rendered useless. The system must extract the correct information before it performs arithmetic, and that information must be relevant to the prompt.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Context-Aware NER:** Enhance Named Entity Recognition (NER) to be context-aware. The NER system should not just identify numbers and entities, but also understand their *role* in the context of the passage and the question. This can be achieved through fine-tuning NER models on question-answering datasets.\n2.  **Develop a Relevance Filter:** Before attempting calculations, implement a relevance filter that evaluates whether the extracted information is relevant to the question being asked. This filter could use techniques like semantic similarity scoring or keyword matching to determine relevance.\n3.  **Implement a question answering module:** Employ machine-learning and deep-learning techniques to determine an answer from the information. A module like this would ingest the prompt and text, and provide an output for the best answer to the given prompt.\n4.  **Prioritize Temporal Reasoning Module:** Implement a module to specifically handle temporal reasoning, which would entail correctly ordering events or identifying values related to time.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, the system's capabilities appear to be **stable but unsatisfactory**. It consistently performs arithmetic correctly *when* it has the correct inputs, but the inputs are almost always wrong. Improvement is needed to make the system more reliable in providing the correct responses.\n"

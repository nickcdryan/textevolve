  "approach_summary": "The script employs a \"Decompose-Solve-Verify\" approach using the Gemini LLM, enhanced by multi-example prompting to improve accuracy. The problem is broken down into smaller steps by `decompose_problem`, then `solve_sub_problems` solves these steps, and `synthesize_solutions` combines the solutions into a final answer which is then verified for coherency using `check_coherency`. The `call_llm` function is used as a wrapper to call the Gemini API with different prompts and system instructions, defining roles like \"expert at decomposing complex math problems\" for each step. The overall workflow involves decomposing the initial question, solving the sub-problems, synthesizing the solutions, verifying that the response is coherent and then returning the final answer or an error message if the coherency check fails.",

      "answer": "First we find the number of $4$ digit palindromes. There are ten palindromes for every distinct thousandth digit from $1$ to $9$ because there are $10$ numbers from $0$ to $9$ we could pick for the second and third digit. This gives us a total of $9 \\cdot 10$ palindromes.\n\nNext, we can get that all palindromes are multiples of $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ tells us that for a number $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$. Since $a=d$ and $b=c$, $a-b+c-d$ is always divisible by $11$ so all four digit palindromes are divisible by $11$.\n\nNow we want to find now many of these palindromes are divisible by $9$. For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9.$ It's impossible for the sum of the digits to be equal to $9$ or $27$ because it must be an even number (the sum is $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)$). We find the number of palindromes whose digits add up to $18.$ Since $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)=18,$ we get that $a+b=9.$ There are $9$ possible answers, where $a$ goes from $1$ to $9$ and $b=9-a$. We then find the number of palindromes whose digit add up to $36.$ There is only one four-digit number that does so, $9999.$\n\nTherefore, we have that there are $9+1=10$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $99.$\n\nSince there is a total of $90$ palindromes, the probability that it is divisible by $99$ is $\\frac{10}{90}=\\boxed{\\frac19}$.",

We can write this as $1001A + 110B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{99}$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the divisibility condition:** Since $1001 = 990 + 11$ and $110 = 99 + 11$, we have $1001A + 110B \\equiv 11A + 11B \\equiv 0 \\pmod{99}$.

        "golden_answer": "First we find the number of $4$ digit palindromes. There are ten palindromes for every distinct thousandth digit from $1$ to $9$ because there are $10$ numbers from $0$ to $9$ we could pick for the second and third digit. This gives us a total of $9 \\cdot 10$ palindromes.\n\nNext, we can get that all palindromes are multiples of $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ tells us that for a number $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$. Since $a=d$ and $b=c$, $a-b+c-d$ is always divisible by $11$ so all four digit palindromes are divisible by $11$.\n\nNow we want to find now many of these palindromes are divisible by $9$. For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9.$ It's impossible for the sum of the digits to be equal to $9$ or $27$ because it must be an even number (the sum is $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)$). We find the number of palindromes whose digits add up to $18.$ Since $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)=18,$ we get that $a+b=9.$ There are $9$ possible answers, where $a$ goes from $1$ to $9$ and $b=9-a$. We then find the number of palindromes whose digit add up to $36.$ There is only one four-digit number that does so, $9999.$\n\nTherefore, we have that there are $9+1=10$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $99.$\n\nSince there is a total of $90$ palindromes, the probability that it is divisible by $99$ is $\\frac{10}{90}=\\boxed{\\frac19}$.",

In other words, 17*x* \u2261 1 (mod 83).\n\n2. **Utilize the Hint:** We are given that 17 * 5 = 85. Notice that 85 is very close to a multiple of 83.\n\n3. **Express 85 in terms of 83:** We can write 85 as 83 + 2. Therefore, 17 * 5 = 83 + 2.\n\n4. **Rewrite the equation modulo 83:** Since 17 * 5 = 83 + 2, we have 17 * 5 \u2261 2 (mod 83).\n\n5. **Isolate 1:** We want to find a multiple of 17 that is congruent to 1 (mod 83).  From the previous step, we have 17 * 5 \u2261 2 (mod 83). We want to manipulate this to get 1 on the right side. We can multiply both sides by some number to achieve this. To turn 2 into 1, we need to find the modular inverse of 2 (mod 83). Since 83 is odd, 2 has a multiplicative inverse, namely $(83+1)/2=42$ since $2\\cdot 42=84\\equiv 1 \\pmod{83}$. Therefore, we can multiply by 42.\n\n6. **Multiply by 42:** Multiplying both sides of 17 * 5 \u2261 2 (mod 83) by 42, we get  17 * 5 * 42 \u2261 2 * 42 (mod 83).\n\n7. **Simplify:** This simplifies to 17 * 210 \u2261 84 (mod 83).\n\n8. **Reduce modulo 83:**  Since 84 \u2261 1 (mod 83), we have 17 * 210 \u2261 1 (mod 83).\n\n9. **Find the Residue:** Now we need to find the residue of 210 modulo 83.

This is a total of $13 + 12 = 25$ numbers.\nDividing 5000 by 25 gives $5000 = 25 \\cdot 200 + 0$.\nThus, there are 200 complete cycles.\nSince the remainder is 0, the $5000^{\\text{th}}$ number is the last number in the cycle.\nSince 200 is an even number, the 201st cycle is going up.\nThe last number in a complete cycle is 1. When the remainder is zero, we take the last element of a full cycle, which is 1. However, since we are counting from 1 to 13 and back to 1, the last element is actually 1. So if the remainder is zero, the number we want is the last element in a complete cycle. Since one cycle is $1, 2, ..., 13, 12, 1, ..., 2, 1$, then the $25$th number is $1$.

        "output": "Decomposition: Here's a decomposition of the problem into smaller, manageable steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the length of one complete cycle:** Find how many numbers are in one complete up-and-down cycle (from 1 to 13 and back to 1).\n\n2.  **Determine how many full cycles occur within the first 5000 numbers:** Divide 5000 by the length of one cycle to find how many complete cycles are included. Determine the quotient and remainder.\n\n3.  **Determine the position within the incomplete cycle:** The remainder from the previous step tells you the position of the 5000th number within the incomplete cycle.\n\n4.  **Consider if the incomplete cycle goes up or down:**  If the number of complete cycles is even, the next cycle is going up. If the number of complete cycles is odd, the next cycle is going down.\n\n5. **Find the corresponding number in the sequence.** Based on the position within the incomplete cycle and whether it's going up or down, find the integer that occupies that position.\n\nSolutions: 1. 25\n2. 200\n3. 200\n4.

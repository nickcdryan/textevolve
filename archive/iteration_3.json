  "approach_summary": "The script uses a test-time training approach to solve grid transformation problems with an LLM. It decomposes the problem into three steps: extracting examples, formulating and testing a hypothesis, and applying the hypothesis to the test input. No specific agent roles are defined. The script relies on `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini LLM using prompts generated in each step, and `solve_grid_transformation` to orchestrate the process. The `main` function simply calls `solve_grid_transformation` with the input question to get the final answer.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**Overall Summary:** The AI system, while showing robustness in execution, fundamentally fails at the core task of pattern recognition and generalization. It consistently produces incorrect outputs, indicating a lack of understanding of the underlying relationships between input and output data.  The system needs significant improvements in its reasoning and problem-solving abilities.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Incorrect Content:** The generated matrices are not related to the correct answer for any of the samples. The specific value `5` appearing prominently suggests a possible bias or incorrect weight somewhere in the model.\n*   **Format Consistency:** The outputs are generally formatted correctly (within the code block), demonstrating the \"Syntactic Correctness\" strength mentioned earlier.  However, there is variation in the format (some include the \"\\n\" character, some don't), which, while not a major error, indicates some instability in the output generation process.\n*   **Redundancy:** The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are correctly placed, signifying the outputs are presented as intended by the system. However, they contain redundant information; the output could be simplified.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates the following:\n\n*   **Limited Capabilities:** The system exhibits very limited capabilities beyond basic text generation and output formatting. Its core functionality of pattern recognition and solution generation is essentially non-existent.\n*   **Rudimentary Understanding:** The system lacks a true understanding of the problem domain. It doesn't grasp the relationship between the input and output grids and struggles with even simple transformations.\n*   **Robustness in Execution:** The system does not crash and is able to produce syntactically correct outputs (matrices), demonstrating a degree of robustness. However, this is insufficient to overcome the fundamental lack of accuracy.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Robustness:** The system consistently produces outputs without crashing, indicating good error handling in terms of runtime errors.\n*   **Syntactic Correctness:** The system can generate syntactically correct matrix-like outputs.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The system's inability to identify, learn, and generalize patterns from training examples is a critical weakness.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** The system demonstrates a profound lack of contextual understanding, treating the input data as if it were irrelevant.\n*   **Dimensionality Mismatch**: The system does not generate the correct dimensionality.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization.** Without a solid foundation in this area, the system cannot effectively solve the problems it's designed for.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Review and Revise the Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** The current pattern recognition algorithm is clearly inadequate.  **Action:** Investigate and implement a more suitable algorithm for grid-based pattern recognition.  Consider Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs) as suggested, but ensure they are correctly configured and trained.\n2.  **Enhance Training Data and Feature Engineering:** Ensure the training data is diverse and representative of the types of patterns the system needs to learn. **Action:** Implement data augmentation techniques to increase the variety of training examples. Explore feature engineering techniques to extract relevant information from the grids and feed it to the learning algorithm. Consider encoding spatial relationships (e.g., adjacency) within the grids as features.\n3.  **Implement Output Dimensionality Verification:** Add a module to explicitly verify that the output dimensionality matches the expected dimensionality based on the input and training data. **Action:** Implement a check at the output layer to ensure the output array has the correct shape.  If not, either reshape it (if appropriate) or generate an error message and trigger debugging.\n4.  **Remove Redundant Code:** Simplify the execution outputs by removing the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags.\n5.  **Debug Specific Value Bias**: Determine why the value '5' appears so frequently in the outputs, even when incorrect. It's possible there is a coding error which makes '5' a common default value.\n6.  **Gradual Progression Training:** Rather than trying to get the model to solve complex patterns immediately, start with very simple patterns, and slowly increase the complexity. This can help the model learn simpler patters before progressing to more complex ones.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level.** There's no evidence of improvement. Without significant changes, the trend will remain flat.\n",

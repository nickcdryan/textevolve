  "approach_summary": "This script solves grid transformation problems by first analyzing unique elements and their transformations using the `analyze_elements` function, which calls the LLM to infer element transformations and validate them. The `transform_grid` function then applies these transformations to the test input grid, also using the LLM with a validation step, followed by a final verification step using the `verify_output_grid` function, which validates using the LLM. The script uses a decomposition approach by focusing on individual element transformations, using agent roles for analysis, transformation, and verification, facilitated by the `call_llm` function. The overall workflow involves analyzing element transformations, applying them to the grid, and then verifying the result.",

In order to produce a valid transformation, I will analyze example 1 only, which shows that no transformation occurs. Applying the transformation from Example 1 to the test input, we get:\n\n```\n[\n  [9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5]\n  [6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2]\n  [9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8]\n  [3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [9, 6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5]\n  [6, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 0, 0, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2]\n  [9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 0, 0, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 0, 0, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [0, 0, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 0, 0, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8]\n  [0, 0, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [9, 6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5]\n  [6, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n]\n```\n\nElement Transformations:\nNo transformations performed.\n\nANSWER_START\n```\n[\n  [9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5]\n  [6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2]\n  [9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8]\n  [3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [9, 6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5]\n  [6, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 0, 0, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2]\n  [9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 0, 0, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 0, 0, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [0, 0, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 0, 0, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8]\n  [0, 0, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n  [9, 6, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5]\n  [6, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2]\n  [5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

It often resorts to simplistic approaches that fail to capture the nuances of the transformations.\n*   **Inconsistent Rule Application:** When multiple training examples are provided, the system has difficulty resolving inconsistencies in the transformations and often defaults to either ignoring most examples or applying them incorrectly.\n*   **Handling Zero Values:** There is a lack of consistent handling of zero values. Sometimes they are treated as unchanged, sometimes they are used in transformations, and this is handled inconsistently across examples.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Generalization:** The system's inability to recognize complex grid transformation patterns and generalize them to new inputs is the most critical bottleneck.\n*   **Conflicting Information Resolution:** The system's failure to handle potentially conflicting information from multiple training examples leads to inconsistent and incorrect solutions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Oversimplification of Transformations:** The system tends to oversimplify the transformations, often assuming direct mappings between numbers without considering their positions or relationships to other numbers.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Rules:** Rules extracted from training examples are applied inconsistently to the test input, leading to errors even when individual transformations are correctly identified.\n*   **Ignoring Important Context:** The system doesn't appear to be extracting enough information and relationships between values within each grid.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to extract and apply complex patterns involving contextual transformations within the grids, leading to oversimplified and inconsistent solutions. The core problem is poor generalization from the provided examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's pattern recognition capabilities to handle more complex transformations that consider spatial relationships and dependencies between grid elements. This may involve exploring techniques like convolutional neural networks or more sophisticated rule-based systems.\n*   **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a robust conflict resolution mechanism to handle inconsistencies in the transformations suggested by different training examples. This may involve assigning weights to examples based on their relevance or using a probabilistic approach to combine conflicting rules.\n*   **Information Extraction:** Enhance information extraction to extract the relationships and patterns with more context from the problem statement.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a More Robust Pattern Recognition Module:** Experiment with different machine learning techniques, such as CNNs or graph neural networks, to learn complex spatial relationships and transformation rules from the training examples. This module should be able to capture dependencies between grid elements and handle inconsistencies in the data.\n2.  **Develop a Conflict Resolution Strategy:** Introduce a mechanism to weigh the relevance of different training examples based on their similarity to the test input. This could involve using a similarity metric to compare the input grids of the training examples to the test input and assigning higher weights to more similar examples.\n3.  **Augment Input Representation:** Rather than directly inputting the grid as a raw array, consider representing the grid with added layers of information. For example, a representation that highlights patterns, edges or areas with similar values.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   Failed Capabilities: Pattern Recognition, Constraint Handling, Solution Verification\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   Failed Capabilities: Pattern Recognition, Constraint Handling, Solution Verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   Failed Capabilities: Pattern Recognition, Constraint Handling, Solution Generation, Solution Verification\n",

For instance, in Sample ID 0, the system directly maps numbers from input to output without considering their position or context within the grid.\n*   **Inconsistent Application:** The system struggles to reconcile conflicting rules from multiple training examples. In Sample ID 2, it acknowledges inconsistencies and defaults to applying only the first example (which involves no transformation), leading to incorrect results.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Zero Values:** The system's handling of zero values is inconsistent, as seen in Sample ID 2. Sometimes zero values are treated as unchanged, and sometimes they trigger a change, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n*   **Invalid Output Format:** The output format for Sample ID 1 seems incorrect as it creates a python array.\n*   **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** The system mentions \"Invalid transformations\" but fails to provide meaningful diagnostics or adapt its approach based on these errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a fundamental understanding of grid parsing and output formatting but lacks the crucial capability to identify and apply complex patterns within the grids. It struggles to generalize from training examples, especially when faced with inconsistent or nuanced transformations. Overall, the system's capabilities are extremely limited, as evidenced by the 0% accuracy.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Grid Parsing:** The system can correctly parse input and output grids.\n*   **Output Formatting:**  The system generally formats the output grid as required (although there are cases, Sample ID 1, where the formatting is completely wrong).\n*   **Basic Transformation Identification:**  The system attempts to identify transformations, even if those attempts are simplistic and often incorrect.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The system's primary weakness is its inability to recognize complex patterns and generalize them effectively.\n*   **Conflict Resolution:** It fails to handle conflicting information from multiple training examples, leading to inconsistent results.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** The system does not capture and use contextual information about the grid elements (position, neighbors, etc.).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization.**  The system must be able to identify and apply more complex, context-aware transformations based on the training data. Without this, it cannot solve the challenges presented.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Module:** Develop a CNN-based module specifically designed to learn spatial relationships and patterns within the grids. Train this module on a large dataset of grid transformation examples to improve its generalization capabilities.\n2.  **Develop a Weighted Conflict Resolution Mechanism:** Implement a conflict resolution strategy that assigns weights to training examples based on their similarity to the test input. This would allow the system to prioritize more relevant examples when resolving inconsistencies. The similarity calculation could involve comparing features like grid size, value distributions, and simple patterns.\n3.  **Refine Input Representation:** Experiment with augmented input representations that encode more information about the grid structure. For example, create feature maps that highlight edges, regions of similar values, or other relevant patterns.\n4.  **Implement a Solution Verification Module:** Before outputting a final solution, implement a module to verify the generated output based on learned rules. This will catch inconsistencies or transformations which are illogical.\n5.  **Improve Error Handling and Reporting:** The system should provide more informative error messages, including specific details about why a transformation is considered invalid.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are **stable but extremely low.** The system is consistently failing to solve the problems, indicating a lack of progress. The suggested improvements are crucial to initiate an upward trend.\n",

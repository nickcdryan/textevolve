  "approach_summary": "The script employs a hybrid approach, combining rule-based extraction with LLM-driven refinement and verification to schedule meetings. `extract_participants_rule_based` extracts participants using regular expressions, then `refine_schedule_with_llm` uses an LLM with few-shot examples to refine the schedule while considering constraints and a validation loop to confirm the schedule is feasible; the LLM acts as an expert scheduler. The `main` function orchestrates this process, calling the extraction and refinement functions and returning the proposed meeting time. The overall workflow involves initial data extraction via regex, LLM-based schedule refinement and verification, and returning the solution.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe predominant runtime error across all provided samples is:\n\n```\nError calling Gemini API: module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'\n```\n\nThis error indicates a fundamental problem with the code's interaction with the Google Gemini API. Specifically, the `google.genai` module is not correctly configured, or the `configure` attribute is not available within that module in the runtime environment. This prevents the system from using the LLM for reasoning, information extraction, and other critical tasks. The repeated \"Schedule refinement failed verification\" messages suggest the verification steps rely on the Gemini API.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the problem descriptions, the system has the following potential strengths:\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding:** The system seems to grasp the high-level goal of scheduling meetings with constraints.\n2.  **Structured Input:** The system can likely handle structured input containing participant schedules, duration, and time preferences, at least to some degree.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement (Intended):** The error messages about \"Schedule refinement\" suggest an attempt at iterative improvement of the solution, although this process is failing due to API issues.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Gemini API Dependency & Configuration:** The system heavily relies on the Gemini API, and its failure to configure correctly renders the entire system useless.\n2.  **Lack of Fallback Mechanism:** There's no apparent fallback mechanism when the API fails. The system immediately gives up and returns \"Could not find a suitable meeting time\" without attempting alternative solutions or error handling.\n3.  **Constraint Handling and Search:** The underlying scheduling logic struggles with complex combinations of constraints, as the system couldn't find valid meeting times even when they existed. This could stem from poor search algorithms or incorrect constraint application.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Gemini API Connectivity/Configuration:** The inability to properly connect to and configure the Gemini API. This is the most immediate and critical issue, as it halts all other operations.\n2.  **Dependence on LLM without Fallback:** The complete dependence on LLM processing without a backup strategy when the LLM calls fail.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent API Error:** All samples exhibit the same `google.genai` configuration error, indicating a systemic issue with environment setup or code initialization.\n2.  **Premature Failure:** The system fails to find a valid meeting time in all cases, even when a solution exists, suggesting a failure to fully explore the solution space and handle constraints effectively. The \"Could not find a suitable meeting time\" response appears even when valid meeting times are possible according to the golden answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the `google.genai` configuration error. Without a functioning LLM connection, the system cannot perform any of its intended tasks. This needs to be resolved before any other improvements can have an effect. The error message \"module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'\" suggests one of the following:\n\n*   The `google-generativeai` library might not be installed in the execution environment.\n*   The code attempts to use `google.genai.configure()` which has been deprecated and doesn't exist anymore. The current way of configuration is using `genai.configure(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")`.\n*   The API key may be missing or incorrectly set.\n*   There might be an environment issue where the Google Cloud SDK or related dependencies are not correctly set up.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **API Configuration Robustness:** Improve error handling and retry mechanisms for the Gemini API connection. Add logging to provide more detailed debugging information.\n2.  **Constraint Handling & Search Efficiency:** Optimize the scheduling algorithm to handle complex combinations of constraints and efficiently search for valid meeting times. Implement backtracking or more sophisticated search strategies.\n3.  **Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement fallback strategies when the Gemini API is unavailable. This could include using cached data, simplified rule-based scheduling, or alerting the user about the API issue.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Verify Gemini API Installation and Configuration:**\n    *   Ensure the `google-generativeai` library is installed (`pip install google-generativeai`).\n    *   **REPLACE `google.genai.configure()` with `genai.configure(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")`**, ensuring to set the API key using environment variables or secure configuration files.\n    *   Double-check Google Cloud SDK setup and authentication if running in a cloud environment.\n2.  **Implement API Connection Error Handling:**\n    *   Wrap the API calls in `try...except` blocks to catch connection errors (`google.auth.exceptions.GoogleAuthError`, `requests.exceptions.RequestException`, etc.).\n    *   Log detailed error messages to aid in debugging.\n    *   Implement exponential backoff and retry mechanisms for API calls.\n3.  **Implement Scheduling Algorithm Improvements:**\n    *   Instead of failing immediately, implement a more robust backtracking search or constraint satisfaction solver.\n    *   Prioritize constraints: Hard constraints (availability) should be checked first, followed by soft constraints (preferences).\n4.  **Create a Fallback Solution:**\n    *   If the Gemini API is unavailable, consider a basic, rule-based scheduling algorithm that can function independently. This could offer a partial solution when the LLM is down. At minimum, this would mean implementing a way to check constraints using the existing data and suggesting possible times without LLM involvement.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction (Likely Failed - due to Gemini API error, schedules were not correctly parsed)\n    *   constraint\\_handling (Likely Failed - due to incorrect information extraction)\n    *   solution\\_generation (Failed - could not generate any solutions)\n    *   solution\\_verification (Failed - API error)\n    *   decision\\_making (Failed - Could not evaluate solutions)\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction (Likely Failed - due to Gemini API error, schedules were not correctly parsed)\n    *   constraint\\_handling (Likely Failed - due to incorrect information extraction)\n    *   solution\\_generation (Failed - could not generate any solutions)\n    *   solution\\_verification (Failed - API error)\n    *   decision\\_making (Failed - Could not evaluate solutions)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction (Likely Failed - due to Gemini API error, schedules were not correctly parsed)\n    *   constraint\\_handling (Likely Failed - due to incorrect information extraction)\n    *   solution\\_generation (Failed - could not generate any solutions)\n    *   solution\\_verification (Failed - API error)\n    *   decision\\_making (Failed - Could not evaluate solutions)\n*   **Sample 3:**\n    *   information\\_extraction (Likely Failed - due to Gemini API error, schedules were not correctly parsed)\n    *   constraint\\_handling (Likely Failed - due to incorrect information extraction)\n    *   solution\\_generation (Failed - could not generate any solutions)\n    *   solution\\_verification (Failed - API error)\n    *   decision\\_making (Failed - Could not evaluate solutions)\n*   **Sample 4:**\n    *   information\\_extraction (Likely Failed - due to Gemini API error, schedules were not correctly parsed)\n    *   constraint\\_handling (Likely Failed - due to incorrect information extraction)\n    *   solution\\_generation (Failed - could not generate any solutions)\n    *   solution\\_verification (Failed - API error)\n    *   decision\\_making (Failed - Could not evaluate solutions)\n",

      "text_report": "```markdown\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly show a complete failure to interact with the Gemini API due to a configuration error. The consistent error message, \"module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure',\" across all samples indicates a fundamental setup issue, likely related to the library installation, API key configuration, or environment setup. The \"Schedule refinement failed verification\" messages are secondary errors, stemming from the initial inability to use the API. Because the API is not configured, no useful processing is occurring and the system simply loops and returns a canned \"Could not find a suitable meeting time\" response in every case, regardless of the input.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the system has **zero demonstrated capability**. It is fundamentally broken due to the API configuration issue. The intended functionalities (information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, verification, and decision-making) are all non-functional due to this root cause. Any perceived strengths based on the problem description are purely theoretical at this point.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **(Theoretical) Problem Understanding:** The system's architecture suggests a potential to understand the problem domain.\n*   **(Theoretical) Structured Input Handling:** The design seems to accommodate structured input.\n*   **(Theoretical) Iterative Refinement:** The intended iterative refinement process is a valuable design feature *if it can be made to work*.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **CRITICAL: Non-Functional API Integration:** The inability to connect to and configure the Gemini API renders the entire system useless.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling & Fallback:** The system crashes hard when the API fails, without attempting any alternative solutions or graceful degradation. The absence of a useful try/except block to catch this exception is a serious problem.\n*   **Potential Inefficiency in Scheduling Algorithm:** Even if the API were working, the consistently failing to find suitable meeting times suggests a potential inefficiency in the core scheduling logic and constraint handling.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **API INTEGRATION AND ERROR HANDLING**. The system *must* be able to reliably connect to the Gemini API and handle potential API failures gracefully.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **IMMEDIATE: Fix Gemini API Configuration:**\n    *   **Verify Installation:** Ensure the `google-generativeai` library is installed in the correct environment (`pip install google-generativeai`).\n    *   **Correct Configuration:** **REPLACE `google.genai.configure()` with `genai.configure(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")`**.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe predominant runtime error across all provided samples is:\n\n```\nError calling Gemini API: module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'\n```\n\nThis error indicates a fundamental problem with the code's interaction with the Google Gemini API. Specifically, the `google.genai` module is not correctly configured, or the `configure` attribute is not available within that module in the runtime environment. This prevents the system from using the LLM for reasoning, information extraction, and other critical tasks. The repeated \"Schedule refinement failed verification\" messages suggest the verification steps rely on the Gemini API.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the problem descriptions, the system has the following potential strengths:\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding:** The system seems to grasp the high-level goal of scheduling meetings with constraints.\n2.  **Structured Input:** The system can likely handle structured input containing participant schedules, duration, and time preferences, at least to some degree.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement (Intended):** The error messages about \"Schedule refinement\" suggest an attempt at iterative improvement of the solution, although this process is failing due to API issues.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Gemini API Dependency & Configuration:** The system heavily relies on the Gemini API, and its failure to configure correctly renders the entire system useless.\n2.  **Lack of Fallback Mechanism:** There's no apparent fallback mechanism when the API fails. The system immediately gives up and returns \"Could not find a suitable meeting time\" without attempting alternative solutions or error handling.\n3.  **Constraint Handling and Search:** The underlying scheduling logic struggles with complex combinations of constraints, as the system couldn't find valid meeting times even when they existed. This could stem from poor search algorithms or incorrect constraint application.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Gemini API Connectivity/Configuration:** The inability to properly connect to and configure the Gemini API. This is the most immediate and critical issue, as it halts all other operations.\n2.  **Dependence on LLM without Fallback:** The complete dependence on LLM processing without a backup strategy when the LLM calls fail.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent API Error:** All samples exhibit the same `google.genai` configuration error, indicating a systemic issue with environment setup or code initialization.\n2.  **Premature Failure:** The system fails to find a valid meeting time in all cases, even when a solution exists, suggesting a failure to fully explore the solution space and handle constraints effectively. The \"Could not find a suitable meeting time\" response appears even when valid meeting times are possible according to the golden answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the `google.genai` configuration error. Without a functioning LLM connection, the system cannot perform any of its intended tasks. This needs to be resolved before any other improvements can have an effect. The error message \"module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'\" suggests one of the following:\n\n*   The `google-generativeai` library might not be installed in the execution environment.\n*   The code attempts to use `google.genai.configure()` which has been deprecated and doesn't exist anymore. The current way of configuration is using `genai.configure(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")`.\n*   The API key may be missing or incorrectly set.\n*   There might be an environment issue where the Google Cloud SDK or related dependencies are not correctly set up.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **API Configuration Robustness:** Improve error handling and retry mechanisms for the Gemini API connection. Add logging to provide more detailed debugging information.\n2.  **Constraint Handling & Search Efficiency:** Optimize the scheduling algorithm to handle complex combinations of constraints and efficiently search for valid meeting times. Implement backtracking or more sophisticated search strategies.\n3.  **Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement fallback strategies when the Gemini API is unavailable. This could include using cached data, simplified rule-based scheduling, or alerting the user about the API issue.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Verify Gemini API Installation and Configuration:**\n    *   Ensure the `google-generativeai` library is installed (`pip install google-generativeai`).\n    *   **REPLACE `google.genai.configure()` with `genai.configure(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")`**, ensuring to set the API key using environment variables or secure configuration files.\n    *   Double-check Google Cloud SDK setup and authentication if running in a cloud environment.\n2.  **Implement API Connection Error Handling:**\n    *   Wrap the API calls in `try...except` blocks to catch connection errors (`google.auth.exceptions.GoogleAuthError`, `requests.exceptions.RequestException`, etc.).\n    *   Log detailed error messages to aid in debugging.\n    *   Implement exponential backoff and retry mechanisms for API calls.\n3.  **Implement Scheduling Algorithm Improvements:**\n    *   Instead of failing immediately, implement a more robust backtracking search or constraint satisfaction solver.\n    *   Prioritize constraints: Hard constraints (availability) should be checked first, followed by soft constraints (preferences).\n4.  **Create a Fallback Solution:**\n    *   If the Gemini API is unavailable, consider a basic, rule-based scheduling algorithm that can function independently. This could offer a partial solution when the LLM is down. At minimum, this would mean implementing a way to check constraints using the existing data and suggesting possible times without LLM involvement.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction (Likely Failed - due to Gemini API error, schedules were not correctly parsed)\n    *   constraint\\_handling (Likely Failed - due to incorrect information extraction)\n    *   solution\\_generation (Failed - could not generate any solutions)\n    *   solution\\_verification (Failed - API error)\n    *   decision\\_making (Failed - Could not evaluate solutions)\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction (Likely Failed - due to Gemini API error, schedules were not correctly parsed)\n    *   constraint\\_handling (Likely Failed - due to incorrect information extraction)\n    *   solution\\_generation (Failed - could not generate any solutions)\n    *   solution\\_verification (Failed - API error)\n    *   decision\\_making (Failed - Could not evaluate solutions)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction (Likely Failed - due to Gemini API error, schedules were not correctly parsed)\n    *   constraint\\_handling (Likely Failed - due to incorrect information extraction)\n    *   solution\\_generation (Failed - could not generate any solutions)\n    *   solution\\_verification (Failed - API error)\n    *   decision\\_making (Failed - Could not evaluate solutions)\n*   **Sample 3:**\n    *   information\\_extraction (Likely Failed - due to Gemini API error, schedules were not correctly parsed)\n    *   constraint\\_handling (Likely Failed - due to incorrect information extraction)\n    *   solution\\_generation (Failed - could not generate any solutions)\n    *   solution\\_verification (Failed - API error)\n    *   decision\\_making (Failed - Could not evaluate solutions)\n*   **Sample 4:**\n    *   information\\_extraction (Likely Failed - due to Gemini API error, schedules were not correctly parsed)\n    *   constraint\\_handling (Likely Failed - due to incorrect information extraction)\n    *   solution\\_generation (Failed - could not generate any solutions)\n    *   solution\\_verification (Failed - API error)\n    *   decision\\_making (Failed - Could not evaluate solutions)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "```markdown\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly show a complete failure to interact with the Gemini API due to a configuration error. The consistent error message, \"module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure',\" across all samples indicates a fundamental setup issue, likely related to the library installation, API key configuration, or environment setup. The \"Schedule refinement failed verification\" messages are secondary errors, stemming from the initial inability to use the API. Because the API is not configured, no useful processing is occurring and the system simply loops and returns a canned \"Could not find a suitable meeting time\" response in every case, regardless of the input.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the system has **zero demonstrated capability**. It is fundamentally broken due to the API configuration issue. The intended functionalities (information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, verification, and decision-making) are all non-functional due to this root cause. Any perceived strengths based on the problem description are purely theoretical at this point.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **(Theoretical) Problem Understanding:** The system's architecture suggests a potential to understand the problem domain.\n*   **(Theoretical) Structured Input Handling:** The design seems to accommodate structured input.\n*   **(Theoretical) Iterative Refinement:** The intended iterative refinement process is a valuable design feature *if it can be made to work*.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **CRITICAL: Non-Functional API Integration:** The inability to connect to and configure the Gemini API renders the entire system useless.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling & Fallback:** The system crashes hard when the API fails, without attempting any alternative solutions or graceful degradation. The absence of a useful try/except block to catch this exception is a serious problem.\n*   **Potential Inefficiency in Scheduling Algorithm:** Even if the API were working, the consistently failing to find suitable meeting times suggests a potential inefficiency in the core scheduling logic and constraint handling.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **API INTEGRATION AND ERROR HANDLING**. The system *must* be able to reliably connect to the Gemini API and handle potential API failures gracefully.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **IMMEDIATE: Fix Gemini API Configuration:**\n    *   **Verify Installation:** Ensure the `google-generativeai` library is installed in the correct environment (`pip install google-generativeai`).\n    *   **Correct Configuration:** **REPLACE `google.genai.configure()` with `genai.configure(api_key=\"YOUR_API_KEY\")`**.  Store the API key securely (e.g., using environment variables) and ensure it's correctly passed to the configuration. Do NOT hardcode the API key directly in the code.\n    *   **Cloud SDK Setup:** Double-check the Google Cloud SDK setup and authentication if running in a cloud environment.\n2.  **Implement Robust API Error Handling:**\n    *   **Wrap API calls in `try...except` blocks:** Specifically, catch `google.auth.exceptions.GoogleAuthError`, `requests.exceptions.RequestException`, and other potential API-related exceptions.\n    *   **Log detailed error messages:** Include the exception type, message, and stack trace in the logs to aid in debugging.\n    *   **Implement Retry Mechanism:** Use exponential backoff and retry mechanisms for API calls to handle transient network issues.  Limit the number of retries to prevent infinite loops.\n    *   **Example:**\n\n    ```python\n    import google.generativeai as genai\n    import os\n    import time\n\n    def call_llm_with_retry(prompt, max_retries=3, backoff_factor=2):\n        \"\"\"Calls the LLM with retry logic.\"\"\"\n        api_key = os.environ.get(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\") # Get the API key from environment variables\n\n        if not api_key:\n            raise ValueError(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY not found in environment variables\")\n\n        genai.configure(api_key=api_key)\n\n        model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')\n\n\n        for attempt in range(max_retries):\n            try:\n                response = model.generate_content(prompt)  # Replace with your actual API call\n                return response.text\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {e}\")\n                if attempt < max_retries - 1:\n                    wait_time = backoff_factor ** attempt\n                    print(f\"Waiting {wait_time} seconds before retrying...\")\n                    time.sleep(wait_time)\n                else:\n                    print(\"Max retries reached.  Returning error.\")\n                    raise  # Re-raise the exception after max retries\n    ```\n3.  **Implement a Basic Scheduling Check Fallback:** If the Gemini API cannot be reached or used, create a basic, non-LLM constraint checking algorithm that can still find possible meeting times based directly on the parsed availability data. This would provide some functionality even when the LLM is down.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Critically Declining.** The system currently demonstrates *no* usable capabilities. The failure to connect to the LLM is a complete regression.\n\nBy implementing the above recommendations, you should first achieve a stable state by resolving the critical API configuration issue, and then you can gradually work on making the scheduling algorithm and fallback robust and more efficient.\n```"

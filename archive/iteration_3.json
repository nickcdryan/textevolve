  "approach_summary": "The script uses dynamic input routing to process scheduling requests and a dedicated verification agent to validate proposed solutions. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `analyze_input` to determine the input type, `schedule_meeting` to propose a schedule, and `verify_solution` to validate it. `analyze_input` determines the input type, `schedule_meeting` proposes a schedule, `verify_solution` validates the schedule, and `call_llm` interfaces with the Gemini API. The overall workflow involves analyzing the input, scheduling a meeting based on the input, and then verifying the proposed solution for validity.",

      "text_report": "Here's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system, focusing on actionable improvements and potential areas of concern:\n\n## RUNTIME ERROR PATTERNS\n\nNo explicit runtime errors are present in the provided raw execution outputs. The \"Invalid\" outputs reflect logical errors in solution verification based on the extracted constraints, not crashes or exceptions during execution. However, the consistent misidentification of valid times indicates a systematic issue with the logic, which is effectively a runtime error in the constraint satisfaction process.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic ability to handle scheduling problems by generating potential solutions and attempting to verify them against provided constraints. However, its performance is severely hampered by inaccurate information extraction and flawed verification logic, leading to frequent errors and a low accuracy score. The system currently fails to reliably identify valid meeting times based on the schedules of the participants.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The system can identify and list the constraints of the provided problem.\n*   **Solution Generation:** The system attempts to generate potential solutions (meeting times).\n*   **Verification Attempt:** The system tries to verify if a generated solution is valid.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Schedule Extraction:** The system frequently fails to accurately extract available time slots and blocked times from the participants' schedules.\n*   **Faulty Verification Logic:** The verification process contains flaws that lead to both false positives (accepting invalid solutions) and false negatives (rejecting valid solutions).\n*   **Poor Constraint Application:** Even when constraints are identified, they are not always accurately applied when generating or verifying solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate schedule extraction**. Until the system can reliably extract the constraints and availability information from the provided text, any improvements to solution generation or verification will be of limited value. This is a foundational component that must be addressed first.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Information Extraction with Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Revise the information extraction prompt to specifically target the accurate identification of available time slots. Use a few-shot learning approach to demonstrate the desired behavior. Provide examples of extracting busy times.\n        *   **Bad example in prompt:**\n          ```json\n          Participants: Amanda, Keith, Ruth\n          Available times: []\n          ```\n\n        *   **Good example in prompt:**\n            ```json\n            Participants: Amanda, Keith, Ruth\n            Busy times: [\"Amanda: 9:00 to 10:00\", \"Ruth: 9:30 to 10:30\"]\n            ```\n\n        *   **Focus:** Explicitly show the extraction of busy and available times.\n          *   *Prompt*:\n          ```\n          Extract participant names, and busy timeslots on each day in the format: `Name: start_time - end_time`.\n\n          Participants: Kelly, Megan\n          Busy Timeslots: [\"Kelly: Monday 10:00 - 11:30\", \"Kelly: Monday 13:00 - 14:00\", \"Kelly: Monday 16:00 - 17:00\", \"Kelly: Tuesday 9:00 - 12:30\", \"Kelly: Tuesday 13:00 - 17:00\", \"Kelly: Wednesday 10:00 - 11:30\", \"Kelly: Wednesday 14:00 - 16:00\", \"Kelly: Wednesday 16:30 - 17:00\", \"Kelly: Thursday 9:00 - 9:30\", \"Kelly: Thursday 10:00 - 11:00\", \"Kelly: Thursday 11:30 - 15:30\", \"Kelly: Thursday 16:00 - 16:30\", \"Kelly: Friday 9:00 - 10:00\", \"Kelly: Friday 10:30 - 11:00\", \"Kelly: Friday 11:30 - 13:00\", \"Kelly: Friday 13:30 - 14:30\", \"Kelly: Friday 15:00 - 17:00\"]\n          ```\n\n    *   **Rationale:** Providing concrete examples will guide the LLM to improve information extraction accuracy and reduce errors.\n\n2.  **Implement a Structured Data Format for Schedule Representation:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Instead of relying on free-form text for schedules, use a structured data format (e.g., JSON) to represent participant availability. This will improve data consistency and facilitate easier programmatic access during verification.\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"participants\": [\n            {\n              \"name\": \"Charles\",\n              \"availability\": {\n                \"Monday\": [\n                  {\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"17:00\"}\n                ],\n                \"Tuesday\": [\n                  {\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"15:30\"}\n                ]\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"name\": \"Cheryl\",\n              \"availability\": {\n                \"Monday\": [\n                  {\"start\": \"10:30\", \"end\": \"11:00\"},\n                  {\"start\": \"12:30\", \"end\": \"13:00\"},\n                  {\"start\": \"15:00\", \"end\": \"15:30\"}\n                ],\n                \"Tuesday\": [\n                  {\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"9:30\"},\n                  {\"start\": \"10:00\", \"end\": \"10:30\"},\n                                  {\"start\": \"11:00\", \"end\": \"11:30\"},\n                  {\"start\": \"13:00\", \"end\": \"13:30\"},\n                                  {\"start\": \"14:00\", \"end\": \"15:00\"},\n                  {\"start\": \"15:30\", \"end\": \"16:00\"}\n                ]\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n        ```\n\n    *   **Rationale:** Structured data representation will make verification logic more robust and less prone to errors caused by inconsistent text formatting.\n\n3. **Negative Examples:**\n\n   * **Action:** Include more explicit negative examples in the prompt of invalid solutions.\n\n4.  **Create a Dedicated Verification Agent/Function:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Implement a specialized function (potentially another LLM call with a specific system prompt) that receives the proposed solution and the structured schedule data as input.

    "capability_report_text": "Here's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system, focusing on actionable improvements and potential areas of concern:\n\n## RUNTIME ERROR PATTERNS\n\nNo explicit runtime errors are present in the provided raw execution outputs. The \"Invalid\" outputs reflect logical errors in solution verification based on the extracted constraints, not crashes or exceptions during execution. However, the consistent misidentification of valid times indicates a systematic issue with the logic, which is effectively a runtime error in the constraint satisfaction process.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic ability to handle scheduling problems by generating potential solutions and attempting to verify them against provided constraints. However, its performance is severely hampered by inaccurate information extraction and flawed verification logic, leading to frequent errors and a low accuracy score. The system currently fails to reliably identify valid meeting times based on the schedules of the participants.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The system can identify and list the constraints of the provided problem.\n*   **Solution Generation:** The system attempts to generate potential solutions (meeting times).\n*   **Verification Attempt:** The system tries to verify if a generated solution is valid.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Schedule Extraction:** The system frequently fails to accurately extract available time slots and blocked times from the participants' schedules.\n*   **Faulty Verification Logic:** The verification process contains flaws that lead to both false positives (accepting invalid solutions) and false negatives (rejecting valid solutions).\n*   **Poor Constraint Application:** Even when constraints are identified, they are not always accurately applied when generating or verifying solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate schedule extraction**. Until the system can reliably extract the constraints and availability information from the provided text, any improvements to solution generation or verification will be of limited value. This is a foundational component that must be addressed first.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Information Extraction with Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Revise the information extraction prompt to specifically target the accurate identification of available time slots. Use a few-shot learning approach to demonstrate the desired behavior. Provide examples of extracting busy times.\n        *   **Bad example in prompt:**\n          ```json\n          Participants: Amanda, Keith, Ruth\n          Available times: []\n          ```\n\n        *   **Good example in prompt:**\n            ```json\n            Participants: Amanda, Keith, Ruth\n            Busy times: [\"Amanda: 9:00 to 10:00\", \"Ruth: 9:30 to 10:30\"]\n            ```\n\n        *   **Focus:** Explicitly show the extraction of busy and available times.\n          *   *Prompt*:\n          ```\n          Extract participant names, and busy timeslots on each day in the format: `Name: start_time - end_time`.\n\n          Participants: Kelly, Megan\n          Busy Timeslots: [\"Kelly: Monday 10:00 - 11:30\", \"Kelly: Monday 13:00 - 14:00\", \"Kelly: Monday 16:00 - 17:00\", \"Kelly: Tuesday 9:00 - 12:30\", \"Kelly: Tuesday 13:00 - 17:00\", \"Kelly: Wednesday 10:00 - 11:30\", \"Kelly: Wednesday 14:00 - 16:00\", \"Kelly: Wednesday 16:30 - 17:00\", \"Kelly: Thursday 9:00 - 9:30\", \"Kelly: Thursday 10:00 - 11:00\", \"Kelly: Thursday 11:30 - 15:30\", \"Kelly: Thursday 16:00 - 16:30\", \"Kelly: Friday 9:00 - 10:00\", \"Kelly: Friday 10:30 - 11:00\", \"Kelly: Friday 11:30 - 13:00\", \"Kelly: Friday 13:30 - 14:30\", \"Kelly: Friday 15:00 - 17:00\"]\n          ```\n\n    *   **Rationale:** Providing concrete examples will guide the LLM to improve information extraction accuracy and reduce errors.\n\n2.  **Implement a Structured Data Format for Schedule Representation:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Instead of relying on free-form text for schedules, use a structured data format (e.g., JSON) to represent participant availability. This will improve data consistency and facilitate easier programmatic access during verification.\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"participants\": [\n            {\n              \"name\": \"Charles\",\n              \"availability\": {\n                \"Monday\": [\n                  {\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"17:00\"}\n                ],\n                \"Tuesday\": [\n                  {\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"15:30\"}\n                ]\n              }\n            },\n            {\n              \"name\": \"Cheryl\",\n              \"availability\": {\n                \"Monday\": [\n                  {\"start\": \"10:30\", \"end\": \"11:00\"},\n                  {\"start\": \"12:30\", \"end\": \"13:00\"},\n                  {\"start\": \"15:00\", \"end\": \"15:30\"}\n                ],\n                \"Tuesday\": [\n                  {\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"9:30\"},\n                  {\"start\": \"10:00\", \"end\": \"10:30\"},\n                                  {\"start\": \"11:00\", \"end\": \"11:30\"},\n                  {\"start\": \"13:00\", \"end\": \"13:30\"},\n                                  {\"start\": \"14:00\", \"end\": \"15:00\"},\n                  {\"start\": \"15:30\", \"end\": \"16:00\"}\n                ]\n              }\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n        ```\n\n    *   **Rationale:** Structured data representation will make verification logic more robust and less prone to errors caused by inconsistent text formatting.\n\n3. **Negative Examples:**\n\n   * **Action:** Include more explicit negative examples in the prompt of invalid solutions.\n\n4.  **Create a Dedicated Verification Agent/Function:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Implement a specialized function (potentially another LLM call with a specific system prompt) that receives the proposed solution and the structured schedule data as input. This function should meticulously check for conflicts. Make sure the `reason` for incorrect answers is detailed.\n        * *Prompt:*\n          ```\n          Problem: Schedule a meeting for Noah and Sean for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday.\n          Existing schedules: Noah: 10:00 - 11:00, Sean: 9:00 - 14:30\n          Proposed solution: 10:30 - 11:00\n          Reason: This time does not work because this is a time that Noah is busy.\n          ```\n\n    *   **Rationale:** This separation of concerns will allow you to focus on improving the verification process without affecting the solution generation logic.\n\n5. **Verify Solution Meets All Constraints:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Focus on verifying that the proposed solution adheres to all given constraints. A good solution should verify:\n        * Solution length: Does it adhere to the specified meeting length.\n        * Availability: Does the time adhere to each participants schedule.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the system's capabilities appear to be **stable but low**. The accuracy score is very low, and the consistent errors indicate a fundamental problem with the underlying logic, especially constraint extraction.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to answer questions by decomposing them into sub-questions, extracting relevant information, and synthesizing a final answer. Each step uses an LLM with a specific role (question decomposer, information extractor, answer synthesizer) and is validated for correctness. The core functions are `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, and `synthesize_answer`, which sequentially process the question. `decompose_question` breaks down the initial question, `extract_information` gathers needed data, and `synthesize_answer` formulates the final answer, with `call_llm` used to interface with the LLM.",

With three large culverins, four guns and three small culverins, Farra  repulsed the enemy artillery with heavy losses. The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano. In September, Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 . Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships and on land by the war in Mantua. Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj.\n\nQUESTION: How many Dutch and English warships were blocking Spanish support?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: On a windy, rainy Sunday the Seahawks hosted the Rams looking to take an effective 3 game lead in the division with a win. The Seahawks drove the ball easily on their first possession, moving to the Ram 1-yard line. After a false start penalty, Seneca Wallace was sacked and fumbled, and the Rams returned the ball 89 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks drove down the field again, this time maintaining possession to the endzone as Darrell Jackson caught a 3-yard TD pass. The lead would change hands 6 more times in the game. With the Rams holding a 16-14 lead in the fourth quarter, Rams coach Scott Linehan chose to challenge a call, nullifying a field goal. The challenge was upheld, but the Rams still faced a fourth down play. Instead of kicking another field goal to increase the lead, Linehan chose to go for a first down. The raucous Qwest Field rose to the occasion, and Rams FB Paul Smith could not hear the play call. Rather than run a pass route he stayed in the backfield to block, and Ram QB Marc Bulger's pass to double covered TE Klopfenstein fell incomplete. Nate Burleson returned a punt 90 yards for a touchdown and a 21-16 lead. After a Rams TD with 2:37 remaining, a series of penalties against St. Louis changed momentum. A holding penalty nullified a successful 2 point convert. The second attempt failed. A 15-yard personal foul was assessed on the subsequent kickoff, and Josh Scobey returned the ball to the Ram 49-yard line. With a short field and time on the clock, Seneca Wallace and Maurice Morris drove the Seahawks to the Ram 20-yard line, where Josh Brown kicked a game-winning field goal with 9 seconds remaining.

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Livonian War  was fought for control of Old Livonia , when the Tsardom of Russia faced a varying coalition of Denmark-Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Union  of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. During the period 1558-1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat  and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden.

During the period 1558-1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat  and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov.

Initially, Henry refused to give up the rights the territory of his ancestors in France, however, Louis restored Guyenne to Henry, thinking that this noble gesture would assure him an extended time of peace with England because he was mostly concerned with going on the Seventh Crusade in 1248 and wanted to rally support for the cause within his own realm. By signing the treaty, Louis and Henry put an end to the century-old conflict between Capetians and Plantagenets concerning the lands inherited by Henry II of England conquered by Philip Augustus of France. By this text, Henry III renounces his claims concerning Normandy, Anjou, Touraine, Maine, and Poitou and Louis IX gave him the necessary sum to maintain 500 knights for two years and the revenues of the Agenais and his domains in the dioceses of Limoges, Cahors, and P\u00e9rigueux. On February 10 1259, the treaty is first ratified by Richard of Cornwall.

The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada, and were given the choice of:  remain and accept baptism,  reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or  be exiled. Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them.

Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies.

The raucous Qwest Field rose to the occasion, and Rams FB Paul Smith could not hear the play call. Rather than run a pass route he stayed in the backfield to block, and Ram QB Marc Bulger's pass to double covered TE Klopfenstein fell incomplete.

      "original_passage": "A truce was signed at Pons on 1 August. A more lasting peace was concluded at Paris on 4 December 1259 amidst the threat of a second Baron's war in England. Initially, Henry refused to give up the rights the territory of his ancestors in France, however, Louis restored Guyenne to Henry, thinking that this noble gesture would assure him an extended time of peace with England because he was mostly concerned with going on the Seventh Crusade in 1248 and wanted to rally support for the cause within his own realm. By signing the treaty, Louis and Henry put an end to the century-old conflict between Capetians and Plantagenets concerning the lands inherited by Henry II of England conquered by Philip Augustus of France. By this text, Henry III renounces his claims concerning Normandy, Anjou, Touraine, Maine, and Poitou and Louis IX gave him the necessary sum to maintain 500 knights for two years and the revenues of the Agenais and his domains in the dioceses of Limoges, Cahors, and P\u00e9rigueux. On February 10 1259, the treaty is first ratified by Richard of Cornwall. On February 17, it was ratified in Westminster by prosecutors in the name of the king, and, by December 4, Simon V de Montfort and Eleanor of England also ratified the treaty. Finally, Henry arrived in France on December 4 1259 to pay homage to Louis, thus symbolically ending the rivalry. Afterwards, an unexpected and lively friendship arised between the two kings to the point that, sometime later, Louis offered Henry an elephant which had been given to him by the Sultan of Egypt and ratified a papal bull, as the feudal overlord of Henry, that annulled the Provisions of Oxford and declared himself as a firm supporter of the Royal prerogative in England.",

The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada, and were given the choice of:  remain and accept baptism,  reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or  be exiled. Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them. Therefore, only a decade after the fall of the Emirate of Granada, the entire Muslim population of Granada had nominally become Christian. A proclamation in 1502 extended these forced conversions to the rest of the lands of Castile, even though those outside Granada had nothing to do with the rebellion. The newly converted Muslims were known as nuevos cristianos  or moriscos . Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies. Many secretly practiced Islam, even as they publicly professed and practiced Christianity. In return, the Catholic rulers adopted increasingly intolerant and harsh policies in order to eradicate these characteristics. This culminated in Philip II's Pragmatica of 1 January 1567 which ordered the Moriscos to abandon their customs, clothing and language. The pragmatica triggered the Morisco revolts in 1568-1571.",

While information extraction seems adequate, the outputs highlight a significant issue:\n\n*   **Lack of Aggregation and Transformation:** The system does not process or aggregate extracted information to answer the questions in the expected format. It provides verbatim text from the source. The given examples show a tendency to return full sentences including relevant data instead of performing any operations.\n*   **Missed Numerical Opportunities:** In several error cases, the system appears to extract the *text* of relevant numbers, not the numbers themselves for computation.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system shows promise in information extraction but lacks crucial reasoning and processing capabilities necessary for a complete solution.\n\n*   **Basic Understanding:** Demonstrates basic understanding by identifying relevant information in the input text.\n*   **Limited Reasoning:** Fails when the question requires arithmetic operations, data aggregation, or any form of data transformation beyond direct extraction.\n*   **Format Inconsistency:** Struggles to match the expected answer format, returning extracted text snippets even when a numerical value or a summarized answer is expected.\n\nOverall, the system operates more like an \"information retriever\" than a \"problem solver\".\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Accurately identifies and extracts relevant information from the passage.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning:** Inability to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction).\n*   **Answer Type Matching:** Inability to understand and adapt to the expected answer format.\n*   **Data Transformation:** Lacks the capability to transform extracted information into a usable format for problem solving.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Arithmetic Reasoning**. Addressing this will significantly improve the system's ability to handle a broader range of questions and scenarios.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the error analysis and capability assessment, here are concrete changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Arithmetic Module:**\n    *   Develop a dedicated module for performing arithmetic operations. This module should:\n        *   Accept a list of numerical values and an operation (e.g., \"sum\", \"difference\") as input.\n        *   Perform the specified operation and return the result.\n        *   Handle unit conversions if necessary (e.g., converting different units of time or distance to a common unit before performing calculations).\n\n2.  **Implement Answer Type Classification:**\n    *   Add a module that classifies questions based on the expected answer type (e.g., numerical, descriptive, boolean, date). This can be achieved using techniques like:\n        *   Keyword analysis (e.g., questions containing \"how many\", \"what is the total\" often require numerical answers).\n        *   Training a classification model on a dataset of questions and their corresponding answer types.\n    *   Use the predicted answer type to guide the answer generation process.\n\n3.  **Refine Prompt Engineering:**\n    *   Modify the prompt to explicitly instruct the system to:\n        *   \"Identify and extract all numerical values and their associated units from the passage.\"\n        *   \"Determine the necessary arithmetic operation(s) required to answer the question.\"\n        *   \"Perform the calculation(s) using the extracted values.\"\n        *   \"Present the final answer in the expected format.\"\n        *   **Example Prompt:** \"Extract all relevant numbers and units from the following text: [Passage Text]. Based on the question: [Question], what arithmetic operations are needed? Perform the calculations and provide the final numerical answer with appropriate units.\"\n\n4.  **Implement Unit Handling:**\n    *   Introduce a basic unit handling mechanism to avoid common errors and handle unit conversion.\n    *   This will require creating a lookup dictionary with different possible units and its converted equivalent.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nAt this point, it is too early to determine a capability trend. However, it is essential to track performance metrics (accuracy, error types) in subsequent iterations to assess the impact of the implemented improvements. Each iteration will ideally show incremental improvements.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings using LLM-driven techniques for information extraction, verification, and time slot finding. It decomposes the problem into three stages: extracting scheduling information, verifying the extracted information, and finding an available time slot, calling the Gemini LLM in each step. The functions `extract_scheduling_info` extracts scheduling details, `verify_extracted_info` validates the extracted information, and `find_available_time_slot` identifies a suitable meeting time based on constraints. The main function `main` orchestrates these steps.",

The system attempts to incorporate constraints such as participant availability and preferences.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system frequently fails to find a valid meeting time even when one exists according to the golden answer. This suggests a flaw in the search or constraint satisfaction process.\n2.  The system struggles to correctly parse and apply all constraints, particularly preferences (\"would like to avoid\") and time restrictions (\"do not want to meet on Monday after 12:00\").\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** The system's inability to accurately incorporate and apply constraints during the solution generation process is a significant bottleneck. It seems to either miss constraints, misinterpret them, or fail to properly integrate them when evaluating potential meeting times.\n2.  **Solution Verification:** Even when the system generates a potentially valid solution, its verification process is flawed, resulting in a \"Could not find a valid meeting time\" response when a solution exists.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Missed Availability Slots:** The most common pattern is the system declaring no valid meeting time exists when the golden answer provides a specific, feasible time slot based on the provided schedules.\n2.  **Preference Neglect:** The system often ignores stated preferences (e.g., \"Donna would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 10:00\") when determining the earliest available time.\n3.  **Time Restriction Errors:** Constraints such as \"Deborah do not want to meet on Monday after 12:00\" are often not correctly implemented or are missed entirely.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is a flawed **constraint satisfaction and solution verification process**. The system is not accurately evaluating potential meeting times against all given constraints. This results in missed valid solutions and incorrect negative responses (\"Could not find a valid meeting time\"). This is not an issue with extracting the information, but how it is reasoned about. The system is likely extracting the constraints just fine, but then fails in how it iterates through and makes decisions based on this extracted information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint Encoding and Application:** Enhance the system's ability to encode and apply constraints when evaluating potential solutions. This requires a more robust method for checking each candidate meeting time against all constraints, including participant availability, time restrictions, and preferences.\n2.  **Solution Generation Logic:** Review the algorithm used for generating potential meeting times. Ensure that it systematically explores all possible combinations of participants, days, and times within the defined work hours, considering the meeting duration.\n3.  **Solution Verification Step:** The verification step needs to be more rigorous. It must explicitly check all constraints against a proposed meeting time before declaring it valid. Add unit tests to verify that it correctly identifies valid and invalid meeting times under various constraint scenarios.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Constraint Satisfaction Module:** Develop a dedicated module responsible for managing and applying constraints. This module would take a list of constraints and a candidate meeting time as input and return whether the meeting time satisfies all constraints. Use LLMs to implement this. Create a new LLM verifier agent to check work.\n2.  **Refine Solution Generation:**\n    *   Use an LLM to create a \"schedule generator\" that walks through the constraints and generates valid solutions based on the constraints.\n    *   Implement a backtracking algorithm for solution generation. This allows the system to systematically explore possible meeting times and backtrack when a conflict is encountered.\n3.  **Enhance Verification Logic:** The verification step should include explicit checks for each constraint:\n    *   Availability: Verify that all participants are available during the proposed time.\n    *   Time Restrictions: Ensure the meeting time adheres to any time-based restrictions.\n    *   Preferences: Check if the meeting time violates any stated preferences. If so, explore other options before declaring failure.\n4.  **Add detailed logging:** Log the extracted constraints, the algorithm's reasoning steps, and the results of each constraint check during the solution verification phase. This will facilitate debugging and identification of specific failure points.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 1:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 3:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 4:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 5:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 6:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 7:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 8:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 9:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

Use the LLM to reason step-by-step about the input constraints and suggest meeting times. Include a backtracking mechanism to explore alternative times when conflicts arise.\n3.  **Implement LLM-Based Solution Verifier Agent:** Create a new LLM verifier agent to critically check the work of the schedule generator. The agent should take a proposed meeting time, the original constraints, and the reasoning trace from the schedule generator, and verify that all constraints are met. This agent should be highly critical and look for any potential violations.\n4.  **Implement Enhanced Verification Logic:** The verification step should include explicit, detailed checks for each constraint type:\n    *   Availability: The LLM agent must confirm that all participants are available during the proposed time based on their schedules.\n    *   Time Restrictions: The LLM agent must ensure the meeting time adheres to any time-based restrictions.\n    *   Preferences: The LLM agent must check if the meeting time violates any stated preferences.

This will facilitate debugging and identification of specific failure points.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **Stable (Critically Low)**.

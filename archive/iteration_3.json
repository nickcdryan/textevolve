  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-driven techniques to schedule meetings by extracting constraints, proposing a time, and verifying the schedule. The problem is decomposed into three steps handled by specialized agents: extracting constraints, scheduling a meeting, and verifying the schedule. The workflow involves calling `extract_constraints` to get meeting details, then `schedule_meeting` to propose a time, and finally `verify_schedule` to check if it's valid, returning the schedule or an error. The script relies on a `call_llm` function to send prompts to the Gemini model.",

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Cheryl, Bryan, Joseph, Maria, Elizabeth and Kimberly for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nCheryl has meetings on Monday during 12:30 to 13:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nBryan has meetings on Monday during 11:30 to 12:30, 16:00 to 17:00; \nJoseph's calendar is wide open the entire day.\nMaria has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:30, 12:00 to 12:30, 14:00 to 14:30, 15:00 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \nElizabeth is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:00, 10:30 to 11:00, 12:30 to 13:30, 15:00 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nKimberly has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \n\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: "

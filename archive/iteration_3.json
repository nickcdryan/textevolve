  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using LLMs to extract participants and constraints from a given question, then finds a suitable meeting time, and finally verifies if the proposed solution is valid. The problem is decomposed into four steps using specialized LLM agents: `extract_participants`, `extract_constraints`, `solve_meeting_problem`, and `verify_solution`. The `call_llm` function is used by all other functions to interact with the Gemini model. The overall workflow involves extraction of participants and constraints, solving the problem and finding a solution, verifying it, and then returning the solution, if valid.",

For instance, in the first example, it correctly identifies individual availabilities, but then incorrectly claims that \"The only time slot where both Carol and Mark are available is 9:00-9:30.\" This highlights a flawed combination of individual schedules.\n*   **Flawed Logic for Overlap Calculation:** The \"Overlap\" calculations often include impossible times or seem to not accurately combine availabilities.\n*   **Reliance on Single Day Analysis:** The Jennifer/Christine example shows it analyses each day independently and then selects the \"earliest,\" which may not be the globally earliest *valid* slot.  It doesn't appear to consider spanning across days or prioritize based on a complete schedule.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of scheduling constraints and can list participant availabilities. However, it struggles to accurately calculate combined availabilities and select a valid, earliest meeting time across multiple schedules. Its core capability of combining schedules and identifying available slots needs significant improvement.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Detailed Availability Analysis:** The system does a reasonably good job of listing individual participant availabilities and busy times.  This detailed initial analysis is a strong foundation to build upon.\n*   **Systematic Approach:** The approach of listing availabilities and then attempting to find overlaps is a sound strategy *if* the overlap calculation is correct.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Calculation:** The *primary* weakness is the flawed logic for determining overlapping available time slots. This stems from a likely incorrect algorithm for comparing and subtracting time intervals.\n*   **Poor Constraint Handling:** Related to the above, the system doesn't accurately handle time interval constraints and scheduling conflicts, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n*   **Lack of Solution Verification:**  The system doesn't have a mechanism to verify that the proposed meeting time is actually valid, given all the constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate availability calculation**. Without this core capability, the system cannot reliably schedule meetings.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a robust and accurate time interval comparison function using Python code for deterministic calculations:** Replace the current, flawed logic with a well-tested algorithm for comparing and subtracting time intervals. This function should handle various overlapping and adjacent time ranges correctly using numerical comparisons, likely converting times to minutes from the start of the day.  *This MUST be implemented in code, not reliant on LLM reasoning which is clearly failing*.\n2.  **Introduce Unit Tests for Time Interval Functions:** Rigorously test the time interval logic with a comprehensive suite of unit tests that cover edge cases, overlapping intervals, different time granularities, and comparisons across days.\n3.  **Implement Solution Verification:** After computing the suggested meeting time, have the system explicitly verify that the proposed time does not conflict with *any* participant's schedule. If a conflict is detected, trigger a re-calculation to find a valid alternative.\n4.  **Refine Few-Shot Examples:**  Include few-shot examples in the prompt that specifically demonstrate *correct* calculations of overlapping availabilities, showing the step-by-step logic. Be sure to include examples that span multiple days.  The examples should focus on edge cases with overlapping times.\n5.  **Use a specialized ReAct agent for scheduling**: Create a scheduling agent that uses the ReAct framework to determine if it is miscalculating any availabilities.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability is **stable but poor**. The system consistently identifies individual availabilities but then fails to combine them correctly. Without addressing the core flaw in availability calculation, the system's capabilities will remain limited.\n",

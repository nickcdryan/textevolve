  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using chain-of-thought reasoning and verification. The problem is decomposed into three steps: rule extraction, rule application, and verification, which are orchestrated by the `solve_grid_transformation` function. The LLM acts as a rule extractor, transformer, and verifier. Other functions include `main` which calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which in turn calls `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model to generate responses based on different prompts. The overall workflow involves extracting a rule from the input grid, applying it to generate a transformed grid, and then verifying the transformation's correctness.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**System Version:** [Insert Version Number Here]\n\n**Report Prepared By:** AI System Capability Analyst\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe system consistently fails to produce correct outputs across all tested samples, achieving an accuracy of 0%. The provided execution outputs showcase syntactically correct Python code representing grids, but the generated grids bear little resemblance to the expected transformations based on the training examples. The system demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the underlying transformation rules. The outputs appear almost random, indicating a lack of effective pattern recognition and spatial reasoning. The runtime analysis reveals no explicit runtime errors, indicating the issues lie within the system's logical reasoning and pattern generalization capabilities.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently possesses limited capabilities. While it can generate code and represent grids, its core functionality of identifying and applying transformation rules is severely deficient. The inability to generalize from training examples to new inputs is the most significant challenge. The system can be considered to be at a very early stage of development.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system's ability to generate syntactically correct Python code is a valuable foundation.\n*   **Grid Representation:** The system demonstrates proficiency in representing grids as nested lists, which is a necessary component for grid transformation tasks.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system's pattern recognition is fundamentally flawed. It cannot identify or learn transformation rules from training data.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The system lacks the ability to reason about spatial relationships between elements in the grid.\n*   **Generalization:** The system fails to generalize learned transformations to new input grids.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system does not appear to adhere to any implicit constraints in the grid transformations.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a mechanism to verify the correctness or validity of its generated solutions.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Pattern Recognition:** Improving the system's pattern recognition capabilities is the single most crucial area for improvement. Without accurate pattern recognition, the system cannot learn transformation rules or generalize to new inputs.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Integrate CNNs for image processing. This will allow the system to learn about spatial relationships and find the appropriate transformation rules between Input and Output Grids. **Rationale:** CNNs are specifically designed to extract spatial hierarchies from images, making them well-suited for identifying patterns in the grid structure.\n2.  **Focus on Simple Training Examples First:** Start training the system with simpler transformation rules before introducing more complex scenarios.

    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**System Version:** [Insert Version Number Here]\n\n**Report Prepared By:** AI System Capability Analyst\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe system consistently fails to produce correct outputs across all tested samples, achieving an accuracy of 0%. The provided execution outputs showcase syntactically correct Python code representing grids, but the generated grids bear little resemblance to the expected transformations based on the training examples. The system demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the underlying transformation rules. The outputs appear almost random, indicating a lack of effective pattern recognition and spatial reasoning. The runtime analysis reveals no explicit runtime errors, indicating the issues lie within the system's logical reasoning and pattern generalization capabilities.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently possesses limited capabilities. While it can generate code and represent grids, its core functionality of identifying and applying transformation rules is severely deficient. The inability to generalize from training examples to new inputs is the most significant challenge. The system can be considered to be at a very early stage of development.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system's ability to generate syntactically correct Python code is a valuable foundation.\n*   **Grid Representation:** The system demonstrates proficiency in representing grids as nested lists, which is a necessary component for grid transformation tasks.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system's pattern recognition is fundamentally flawed. It cannot identify or learn transformation rules from training data.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The system lacks the ability to reason about spatial relationships between elements in the grid.\n*   **Generalization:** The system fails to generalize learned transformations to new input grids.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system does not appear to adhere to any implicit constraints in the grid transformations.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a mechanism to verify the correctness or validity of its generated solutions.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Pattern Recognition:** Improving the system's pattern recognition capabilities is the single most crucial area for improvement. Without accurate pattern recognition, the system cannot learn transformation rules or generalize to new inputs.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Integrate CNNs for image processing. This will allow the system to learn about spatial relationships and find the appropriate transformation rules between Input and Output Grids. **Rationale:** CNNs are specifically designed to extract spatial hierarchies from images, making them well-suited for identifying patterns in the grid structure.\n2.  **Focus on Simple Training Examples First:** Start training the system with simpler transformation rules before introducing more complex scenarios. This will allow the system to learn basic concepts before tackling more challenging patterns. **Rationale:** Building a strong foundation with simpler examples will improve the system's ability to generalize to more complex cases.\n3.  **Implement Data Augmentation Techniques:** Apply data augmentation techniques such as rotations, flips, and translations to the training data. This will increase the size of the training dataset and expose the system to a wider variety of patterns. **Rationale:** Data augmentation can help the system to become more robust to variations in the input data and improve generalization performance.\n4.  **Introduce an Evaluation Metric During Training:** Implement an evaluation metric during the training process to assess the performance of the system on a validation dataset. This will provide valuable feedback and allow for iterative improvement. **Rationale:** Monitoring performance on a validation set will help to identify areas where the system is struggling and to prevent overfitting.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining:** Based on the current performance, the system's capabilities are effectively declining as the lack of accuracy prevents it from solving the problems and thus performing its central task.

The Knowledge Navigator iteratively refines search queries and extracts candidate answers and sources, while the Fact Checker validates the answer. The core functions are `call_llm` to interact with the LLM, `knowledge_navigator` to find a candidate answer, and `fact_checker` to validate the answer. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `knowledge_navigator` to obtain a candidate answer and source, then calls `fact_checker` to validate and return the final answer.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no explicit runtime errors (like JSONDecodeError or TypeError) present in the provided outputs. This suggests that the code is executing without crashing, but the reasoning within the code is flawed.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval:** The system successfully retrieves candidate answers and their sources. This is evident in both the success and error cases. It's able to find data related to the questions.\n2.  **Validation:** The system includes a \"validation result\" which indicates some form of checking, even if it's flawed in its current implementation.\n3.  **Answer Formatting:** The system is consistently able to extract and format the answer within the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information:** The system retrieves incorrect information, leading to wrong answers (e.g., Sample ID 0 and 2). This suggests a problem with the accuracy of information retrieval or the source reliability.\n2.  **Flawed Validation:** The validation process reports \"VALID\" even when the answer is demonstrably incorrect. This indicates a significant flaw in the validation logic. It's not effectively comparing the extracted information with any known constraints or reliable sources.\n3. **Source Prioritization/Selection**: The system is picking a source that contains the incorrect information, rather than the correct source.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Inadequate Validation Logic:** The validation component is not reliably identifying and rejecting incorrect information. It's a critical bottleneck because it prevents the system from correcting errors and leads to confident, but wrong, answers.\n2.  **Poor Source Selection/Prioritization:** The system seems to select or prioritize less reliable sources over more reliable ones. This leads to the inclusion of incorrect information early in the reasoning process.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary error pattern is a \"false positive\" validation. The system retrieves incorrect information and then incorrectly validates it as correct, leading to a wrong final answer. This suggests a problem with the validation algorithm or the data used for validation.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure of the validation component to accurately assess the correctness of candidate answers.** It's reporting \"VALID\" even when the retrieved information is incorrect, indicating a fundamental flaw in its logic and/or the data it uses to perform the validation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Validation Logic:**  The validation logic needs significant improvement.  It needs to be much more robust and accurate in identifying incorrect information.\n2.  **Source Reliability:** The system needs to incorporate a mechanism to assess the reliability of information sources and prioritize more reliable sources.\n3.  **Fact Checking:** Implement a more rigorous fact-checking step, potentially by consulting multiple independent sources to corroborate information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Validation Algorithm:** Review the current validation algorithm. What criteria are used to determine validity? Implement stricter checks, such as comparing the candidate answer against multiple sources or using external knowledge bases for verification.  For date-related questions, implement date range checking and sanity checks to ensure the extracted dates are reasonable.\n2.  **Implement Source Ranking:** Create a system to rank information sources based on their reliability. Prefer official websites, reputable databases (like Wikidata), and established academic resources. Penalize or exclude sources known to be unreliable.\n3.  **Multi-Source Verification:** Modify the system to gather information from multiple sources and compare the results. If there are discrepancies, investigate further and prioritize information from more reliable sources. Flag potential contradictions and, if possible, attempt to resolve them.\n4. **Add Logging/Debugging Statements:** Insert print statements within the validation logic and the source selection logic to observe the values of variables and understand why the system is making certain decisions. This will aid in debugging and identifying specific failure points.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n*   information_extraction: Possibly inaccurate extraction.\n*   solution_verification: Failed. The validation logic incorrectly identified an incorrect answer as valid.\n*   decision_making: Failed (due to flawed validation).\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n*   information_extraction: Possibly inaccurate extraction.\n*   solution_verification: Failed. The validation logic incorrectly identified an incorrect answer as valid.\n*   decision_making: Failed (due to flawed validation).\n",

Specifically:\n\n*   **Candidate Answers and Sources:** The system successfully extracts candidate answers and their corresponding sources in all three samples.\n*   **Incorrect Validation:**  The \"Validation result is VALID\" message appears consistently, even when the candidate answer is incorrect (e.g., \"1941\" for Sample ID 0 and \"October 24, 1957\" for sample ID 2, given the overall accuracy of 1/3). This validates the crucial problem identified in the Error Analysis Report. The validator is broken.\n*   **Answer Formatting:** The system consistently formats the extracted answer within `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags, demonstrating a functional output formatting mechanism.\n* **Varying Source Quality:** the source quality seems to vary, from potentially unreliable sources like `dc.fandom.com` to more reliable ones like `lop.parl.ca`. The source selected seems to correlate strongly with correctness.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic information retrieval and output formatting capabilities. However, its primary capability \u2013 knowledge validation \u2013 is severely flawed, rendering the system largely ineffective. The system retrieves information and formats an answer, but its validation is non-functional.  This lack of reliable validation undermines the entire system.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Successful extraction of candidate answers and sources from retrieved documents.\n*   **Answer Formatting:** Consistent and correct formatting of extracted answers using `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Validation:** The validation logic consistently fails to identify and reject incorrect answers, leading to false positives. This is the most significant weakness.\n*   **Poor Source Prioritization:** The system does not appear to prioritize reliable sources over less reliable ones, leading to the inclusion of incorrect information in the reasoning process.\n*   **Lack of Fact-Checking:** There's no evidence of cross-referencing information or consulting multiple sources to verify accuracy.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Validation Logic**.  A reliable validation mechanism is essential for ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of the system's responses.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Develop a Robust Validation Algorithm:**\n    *   **Implement Multiple Checks:**  Incorporate multiple validation checks, including comparing the candidate answer against multiple independent sources (if available), using external knowledge bases (like Wikidata) for verification, and applying logical reasoning and sanity checks.\n    *   **Data Type Validation:** Ensure the extracted information is of the correct data type (e.g., date, number, string) and falls within reasonable bounds.\n    *   **Contextual Validation:** Validate the answer within the context of the question.  Does the answer make sense given the information provided in the question?\n    *   **Implement a Confidence Score:** Instead of a simple \"VALID\" / \"INVALID\" output, assign a confidence score to each candidate answer based on the validation checks performed.\n\n2.  **Implement Source Ranking and Prioritization:**\n    *   **Create a Source Reliability Database:** Develop a database that ranks information sources based on their reliability (e.g., official websites, reputable databases, academic publications).\n    *   **Prioritize Reliable Sources:** Modify the system to prioritize information from more reliable sources during information retrieval and validation.\n    *   **Penalize Unreliable Sources:**  Penalize or exclude sources known to be unreliable (e.g., user-generated content, blogs with questionable reputations).\n\n3.  **Implement Multi-Source Verification:**\n    *   **Gather Information from Multiple Sources:** Modify the system to gather information from multiple sources for each question.\n    *   **Compare Results:** Compare the results from different sources and identify any discrepancies.\n    *   **Prioritize Consistent Information:** Prioritize information that is consistent across multiple reliable sources.\n    *   **Flag Contradictions:** Flag potential contradictions and attempt to resolve them by consulting additional sources or using logical reasoning.\n\n4.  **Add Logging/Debugging Statements (Crucial for Iterative Improvement):**\n    *   **Comprehensive Logging:** Insert print statements (or use a proper logging framework) within the validation logic and source selection logic to observe the values of variables and understand why the system is making certain decisions.\n    *   **Track Source Ranking:** Log the source rankings used and the reasoning behind the ranking.\n    *   **Log Validation Results:** Log the results of each individual validation check performed.\n    *   **Analyze Logs:** Regularly analyze the logs to identify patterns in the system's behavior and pinpoint specific failure points.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the current accuracy of 0.33 and the severely flawed validation logic, the capability trend is currently **stable, but unacceptably low**.  Without significant improvements to the validation and source prioritization mechanisms, the system will not be able to improve its accuracy and trustworthiness. Implementing the actionable recommendations above is essential for shifting the trend towards improvement.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no explicit runtime errors (like JSONDecodeError or TypeError) present in the provided outputs. This suggests that the code is executing without crashing, but the reasoning within the code is flawed.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval:** The system successfully retrieves candidate answers and their sources. This is evident in both the success and error cases. It's able to find data related to the questions.\n2.  **Validation:** The system includes a \"validation result\" which indicates some form of checking, even if it's flawed in its current implementation.\n3.  **Answer Formatting:** The system is consistently able to extract and format the answer within the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information:** The system retrieves incorrect information, leading to wrong answers (e.g., Sample ID 0 and 2). This suggests a problem with the accuracy of information retrieval or the source reliability.\n2.  **Flawed Validation:** The validation process reports \"VALID\" even when the answer is demonstrably incorrect. This indicates a significant flaw in the validation logic. It's not effectively comparing the extracted information with any known constraints or reliable sources.\n3. **Source Prioritization/Selection**: The system is picking a source that contains the incorrect information, rather than the correct source.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Inadequate Validation Logic:** The validation component is not reliably identifying and rejecting incorrect information. It's a critical bottleneck because it prevents the system from correcting errors and leads to confident, but wrong, answers.\n2.  **Poor Source Selection/Prioritization:** The system seems to select or prioritize less reliable sources over more reliable ones. This leads to the inclusion of incorrect information early in the reasoning process.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary error pattern is a \"false positive\" validation. The system retrieves incorrect information and then incorrectly validates it as correct, leading to a wrong final answer. This suggests a problem with the validation algorithm or the data used for validation.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure of the validation component to accurately assess the correctness of candidate answers.** It's reporting \"VALID\" even when the retrieved information is incorrect, indicating a fundamental flaw in its logic and/or the data it uses to perform the validation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Validation Logic:**  The validation logic needs significant improvement.  It needs to be much more robust and accurate in identifying incorrect information.\n2.  **Source Reliability:** The system needs to incorporate a mechanism to assess the reliability of information sources and prioritize more reliable sources.\n3.  **Fact Checking:** Implement a more rigorous fact-checking step, potentially by consulting multiple independent sources to corroborate information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Validation Algorithm:** Review the current validation algorithm. What criteria are used to determine validity? Implement stricter checks, such as comparing the candidate answer against multiple sources or using external knowledge bases for verification.  For date-related questions, implement date range checking and sanity checks to ensure the extracted dates are reasonable.\n2.  **Implement Source Ranking:** Create a system to rank information sources based on their reliability. Prefer official websites, reputable databases (like Wikidata), and established academic resources. Penalize or exclude sources known to be unreliable.\n3.  **Multi-Source Verification:** Modify the system to gather information from multiple sources and compare the results. If there are discrepancies, investigate further and prioritize information from more reliable sources. Flag potential contradictions and, if possible, attempt to resolve them.\n4. **Add Logging/Debugging Statements:** Insert print statements within the validation logic and the source selection logic to observe the values of variables and understand why the system is making certain decisions. This will aid in debugging and identifying specific failure points.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n*   information_extraction: Possibly inaccurate extraction.\n*   solution_verification: Failed. The validation logic incorrectly identified an incorrect answer as valid.\n*   decision_making: Failed (due to flawed validation).\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n*   information_extraction: Possibly inaccurate extraction.\n*   solution_verification: Failed. The validation logic incorrectly identified an incorrect answer as valid.\n*   decision_making: Failed (due to flawed validation).\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.33 (1/3)\n*   Error samples: 2/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:** (As Provided)\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the Error Analysis Report's findings.  Specifically:\n\n*   **Candidate Answers and Sources:** The system successfully extracts candidate answers and their corresponding sources in all three samples.\n*   **Incorrect Validation:**  The \"Validation result is VALID\" message appears consistently, even when the candidate answer is incorrect (e.g., \"1941\" for Sample ID 0 and \"October 24, 1957\" for sample ID 2, given the overall accuracy of 1/3). This validates the crucial problem identified in the Error Analysis Report. The validator is broken.\n*   **Answer Formatting:** The system consistently formats the extracted answer within `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags, demonstrating a functional output formatting mechanism.\n* **Varying Source Quality:** the source quality seems to vary, from potentially unreliable sources like `dc.fandom.com` to more reliable ones like `lop.parl.ca`. The source selected seems to correlate strongly with correctness.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic information retrieval and output formatting capabilities. However, its primary capability \u2013 knowledge validation \u2013 is severely flawed, rendering the system largely ineffective. The system retrieves information and formats an answer, but its validation is non-functional.  This lack of reliable validation undermines the entire system.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Successful extraction of candidate answers and sources from retrieved documents.\n*   **Answer Formatting:** Consistent and correct formatting of extracted answers using `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Validation:** The validation logic consistently fails to identify and reject incorrect answers, leading to false positives. This is the most significant weakness.\n*   **Poor Source Prioritization:** The system does not appear to prioritize reliable sources over less reliable ones, leading to the inclusion of incorrect information in the reasoning process.\n*   **Lack of Fact-Checking:** There's no evidence of cross-referencing information or consulting multiple sources to verify accuracy.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Validation Logic**.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to solve visual pattern completion problems by decomposing the task into pattern identification, rule construction, and visual pattern completion, followed by rule-based refinement. It employs several agent roles including visual pattern identifier, rule creator, and pattern completer. The `call_llm` function interfaces with the Gemini model, `identify_patterns` extracts patterns from the input, `construct_transformation_rule` formulates a rule based on identified patterns, `visual_pattern_completion` applies the rule to the test input, and `rule_based_refinement` refines the completed grid using manual rule checks. The overall workflow involves identifying patterns, constructing a transformation rule, completing the visual pattern based on the rule, and refining the result.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nBased on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and capability mapping, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system:\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs highlight several key issues:\n\n*   **Sample 0: Failure to Identify and Act on Elements:** The system incorrectly states there are no 5s in the grid despite their presence, leading to a completely zeroed-out output. This indicates a fundamental flaw in element identification.\n*   **Sample 1: Premature Termination and Boundary Errors:** The system aborts processing due to perceived boundary issues when extracting a subgrid. This premature termination prevents any useful solution generation and reflects poor boundary handling. The logic around whether or not the subgrid exceeds the boundary is flawed.\n*   **Sample 2: Incorrect Pattern Application:** The output for Sample 2 doesn't resemble the golden answer and appears to simply output the input. The system struggles to apply the transformation rule and demonstrate the 'pattern_extraction' capability. This indicates an issue in understanding the transformation logic, and is likely related to the flawed pattern extrapolation.\n\nThe consistent failure across all samples points to systemic issues rather than isolated incidents. The errors are logical and algorithmic, not runtime exceptions (aside from the error message in Sample 1, which is logically generated).\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently exhibits very limited capabilities. While it shows some understanding of initial instructions and can identify (sometimes incorrectly) elements in a grid, it fundamentally fails at generalizing from examples, handling grid boundaries, and generating correct outputs based on learned patterns. The pattern extraction and solution generation are severely lacking.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Initial Rule Understanding:** The system can parse and restate the rules based on training examples. This is a foundational strength.\n*   **Element Identification (Potential):** The system *attempts* to identify elements, even if it makes errors. This suggests the basic infrastructure for element identification exists, but needs significant improvement.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Extrapolation & Generalization:** The system cannot reliably apply learned patterns to new inputs, especially when the input size or pattern complexity changes.\n*   **Grid Boundary Handling:** Inability to accurately determine grid boundaries and perform calculations at the edges leads to premature termination or incorrect results.\n*   **Inaccurate Element Identification:** The system incorrectly assesses the presence of elements within the grid.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Extrapolation & Generalization**. Addressing this will directly impact the system's ability to solve new problems beyond the training examples.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Debugging and Testing Element Identification:** Before addressing pattern extrapolation, ensure the system can reliably identify elements within the input grid. Add print statements to confirm it correctly identifies the position of relevant elements like \"5\" *before* attempting any grid transformations. Focus on fixing the bug in Sample 0, where it claims there are no 5's when there are.\n\n2.  **Implement Simplified Pattern Extrapolation Logic:** Start with a simpler version of the pattern extrapolation logic to make it easier to debug. For example, if the rule involves adding 1s around a '5', initially implement *only* this specific rule. Remove any premature boundary checks during this initial phase.\n\n3.  **Explicit Boundary Handling:**\n    *   **Define Boundary Behavior:** Clearly define what should happen when the pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries (e.g., truncate the pattern, wrap around, fill with a default value).\n    *   **Robust Boundary Checks (Post-Extrapolation):** *After* attempting to extrapolate the pattern, implement boundary checks to truncate the pattern only if necessary.\n    *   **Replace Premature Termination:** Replace the premature termination in Sample 1 with an actual attempt at calculating the subgrid, even if it involves truncation at the boundaries. Add logging to show *why* truncation occurred.\n\n4.  **Add Unit Tests:** Create a suite of unit tests that specifically target:\n    *   Element Identification accuracy.\n    *   Pattern Extrapolation in the center of the grid.\n    *   Pattern Extrapolation at the edges of the grid, covering all boundary conditions (top, bottom, left, right corners, etc.)\n\n5.  **Increase Logging Visibility:** Add extensive logging throughout the code, especially:\n    *   When identifying elements.\n    *   When calculating the extended pattern.\n    *   When performing boundary checks.\n    *   Before and after each grid transformation.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0/3 accuracy), the capability trend is **declining**. The errors are fundamental and systemic, indicating a significant gap between the system's intended capabilities and its actual performance. A focused effort on addressing the weaknesses and implementing the actionable recommendations is crucial to reverse this trend.\n",

However, sample_id 1 throws a logical error where it prematurely terminates and produces an error message instead of a grid.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Rule Understanding:** The system seems capable of initially understanding the rules based on the training examples as reflected by the first part of its responses.\n*   **Identifying Elements:** The system demonstrates the ability to identify specific elements (e.g., the number 5) within the input grid.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect identification of elements present in the grid:** In sample_id 0, the system states \"Since there are no 5s in the input grid...\" which is an incorrect assessment of the provided input.\n*   **Extrapolation/Generalization from Examples:** The system struggles to apply the learned rules to new, unseen inputs, particularly when the input dimensions or the pattern complexity deviates slightly from the training examples.\n*   **Grid Boundary Handling:** The system exhibits flaws in understanding grid boundaries, leading to incorrect calculations of surrounding cells or prematurely throwing boundary errors.\n*   **Output Format and Dimensions:** The system sometimes produces outputs with incorrect dimensions, suggesting issues with how the grid transformations are implemented.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Flawed Pattern Extrapolation:** The system struggles to generalize the patterns learned from the training examples to the test input.\n*   **Inaccurate Grid Boundary Management:** The system cannot reliably determine how patterns extend in the grid, especially at the edges, leading to errors or exceptions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Inaccurate Assessment of Input:** The system demonstrates the capacity for identifying elements in the grid, but sometimes does so incorrectly.\n*   **Premature Termination due to Boundary Concerns:** The system aborts calculations early, assuming subgrid operations exceed boundaries, rather than attempting to handle edge cases.\n*   **Dimension Mismatch in Outputs:** The output grid does not have the correct number of rows and columns.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **flawed pattern extrapolation and boundary handling** during grid transformations. The system's inability to accurately extend the learned patterns on the grid (especially at the edges) prevents it from generating correct outputs. Inaccurate assessment of element location exacerbates these issues.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Extrapolation:** Improve the system's ability to generalize patterns from training examples to test inputs, including cases where input dimensions or patterns vary slightly.\n*   **Grid Boundary Handling:** Enhance the system's understanding of grid boundaries and its ability to perform calculations correctly, even at the edges of the grid. Explicitly define edge case behavior.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Introduce More Diverse Training Examples:** Expand the training dataset to include a broader range of input grid dimensions, pattern complexities, and edge-case scenarios.\n*   **Implement Robust Boundary Checking:** Implement more precise boundary checks within the code to handle edge cases effectively, rather than prematurely terminating execution.\n*   **Refine Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** Improve the pattern recognition algorithm to better identify and adapt to variations in input patterns.\n*   **Add Print Statements:** Insert \"print\" statements at intermediate steps, especially concerning element location and determination of grid boundaries.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**sample_id: 0**\n*   information_extraction: FAILED - Did not identify the presence of the number \"5\" in the input.\n*   solution_generation: FAILED - Generated an all-zero grid, rather than an appropriate pattern of 1's surrounding the 5's.\n\n**sample_id: 1**\n*   solution_generation: FAILED - Prematurely stopped and returned an error message.\n*   constraint_handling: FAILED - Incorrectly assumed that creating a subgrid will exceed grid boundaries.\n\n**sample_id: 2**\n*   solution_generation: FAILED - The provided numerical output is not similar to the Golden Answer.\n*   pattern_extraction: FAILED - The system did not properly extract the pattern, instead providing the same array as the input array.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nBased on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and capability mapping, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system:\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs highlight several key issues:\n\n*   **Sample 0: Failure to Identify and Act on Elements:** The system incorrectly states there are no 5s in the grid despite their presence, leading to a completely zeroed-out output. This indicates a fundamental flaw in element identification.\n*   **Sample 1: Premature Termination and Boundary Errors:** The system aborts processing due to perceived boundary issues when extracting a subgrid. This premature termination prevents any useful solution generation and reflects poor boundary handling. The logic around whether or not the subgrid exceeds the boundary is flawed.\n*   **Sample 2: Incorrect Pattern Application:** The output for Sample 2 doesn't resemble the golden answer and appears to simply output the input. The system struggles to apply the transformation rule and demonstrate the 'pattern_extraction' capability. This indicates an issue in understanding the transformation logic, and is likely related to the flawed pattern extrapolation.\n\nThe consistent failure across all samples points to systemic issues rather than isolated incidents. The errors are logical and algorithmic, not runtime exceptions (aside from the error message in Sample 1, which is logically generated).\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently exhibits very limited capabilities. While it shows some understanding of initial instructions and can identify (sometimes incorrectly) elements in a grid, it fundamentally fails at generalizing from examples, handling grid boundaries, and generating correct outputs based on learned patterns. The pattern extraction and solution generation are severely lacking.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Initial Rule Understanding:** The system can parse and restate the rules based on training examples. This is a foundational strength.\n*   **Element Identification (Potential):** The system *attempts* to identify elements, even if it makes errors. This suggests the basic infrastructure for element identification exists, but needs significant improvement.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Extrapolation & Generalization:** The system cannot reliably apply learned patterns to new inputs, especially when the input size or pattern complexity changes.\n*   **Grid Boundary Handling:** Inability to accurately determine grid boundaries and perform calculations at the edges leads to premature termination or incorrect results.\n*   **Inaccurate Element Identification:** The system incorrectly assesses the presence of elements within the grid.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Extrapolation & Generalization**. Addressing this will directly impact the system's ability to solve new problems beyond the training examples.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Debugging and Testing Element Identification:** Before addressing pattern extrapolation, ensure the system can reliably identify elements within the input grid. Add print statements to confirm it correctly identifies the position of relevant elements like \"5\" *before* attempting any grid transformations. Focus on fixing the bug in Sample 0, where it claims there are no 5's when there are.\n\n2.  **Implement Simplified Pattern Extrapolation Logic:** Start with a simpler version of the pattern extrapolation logic to make it easier to debug. For example, if the rule involves adding 1s around a '5', initially implement *only* this specific rule. Remove any premature boundary checks during this initial phase.\n\n3.  **Explicit Boundary Handling:**\n    *   **Define Boundary Behavior:** Clearly define what should happen when the pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries (e.g., truncate the pattern, wrap around, fill with a default value).\n    *   **Robust Boundary Checks (Post-Extrapolation):** *After* attempting to extrapolate the pattern, implement boundary checks to truncate the pattern only if necessary.\n    *   **Replace Premature Termination:** Replace the premature termination in Sample 1 with an actual attempt at calculating the subgrid, even if it involves truncation at the boundaries. Add logging to show *why* truncation occurred.\n\n4.  **Add Unit Tests:** Create a suite of unit tests that specifically target:\n    *   Element Identification accuracy.\n    *   Pattern Extrapolation in the center of the grid.\n    *   Pattern Extrapolation at the edges of the grid, covering all boundary conditions (top, bottom, left, right corners, etc.)\n\n5.  **Increase Logging Visibility:** Add extensive logging throughout the code, especially:\n    *   When identifying elements.\n    *   When calculating the extended pattern.\n    *   When performing boundary checks.\n    *   Before and after each grid transformation.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0/3 accuracy), the capability trend is **declining**. The errors are fundamental and systemic, indicating a significant gap between the system's intended capabilities and its actual performance. A focused effort on addressing the weaknesses and implementing the actionable recommendations is crucial to reverse this trend.\n"

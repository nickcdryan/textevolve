  "approach_summary": "The script implements a multi-stage LLM-driven approach to answer questions, focusing on numerical reasoning and verification. It decomposes the problem into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The agents are question analyzer, passage extractor, answer generator, and answer verifier which are implemented in the functions `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer` respectively, with each using the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow by calling these functions sequentially, passing the output of one as input to the next, and returns the final verified answer.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: After the first three possessions of the game ended in punts, the Patriots marched 62 yards to the Bills 14-yard line, but the drive ended with Gostkowski missing a 36-yard field goal. On the third play of the Bills resulting possession, though, Kyle Orton was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Patriots 39-yard line. The Patriots marched 61 yards in just five plays to take the lead on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Tim Wright. After both teams punted, the Bills lugged 67 yards in just under 5 minutes to tie the game 7-7 on a Kyle Orton touchdown pass to Robert Woods. After a Patriots three-and-out, Orton was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Jones recovering at the Bills 24. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, however, but Gostkowski was successful on a 42-yard field goal try. With 0:06 seconds left in the half, the Bills were attempting to run out the clock, but McCourty stripped C. J. Spiller with Zach Moore recovering at the Bills 42. Brady hit Edelman on a quick 7 yards pass and Gostkowski kicked a 53-yarder for a 13-7 lead at the half. After receiving the opening kickoff of the second half the Patriots reached the Bills 43 in just five plays before Brady launched a bomb to Brian Tyms for a 43-yard touchdown, increasing the New England lead to 20-7. The Bills struck right back with a 13 play, 80-yard drive in just under 7 minutes, culminating in Fred Jackson scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Patriots marched 56 yards on their next possession with Gostkowski adding a 40-yard field goal to increase the lead to 23-14. After a Bills punt Brady led the Patriots down the field and, with just over 6 minutes remaining, found his favorite target, Gronkowski, for a 17-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for an offensive holding penalty on Jordan Devey. This would prove to just be a delay, because Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to LaFell two plays later, capping a 12 play, 80-yard drive. The Patriots now led 30-14 and looked to be well on their way to victory. However, the Bills wouldn't go away quietly. Kyle Orton calmly engineered an 8 play, 80-yard drive, aided by a 35-yard completion on 4th-and-2, that ended in his 8-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan, with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to one possession, 30-22. Starting at the Patriots 7, Brady converted a 3rd-and-16 with a 17-yard completion to Gronkowski, and a few plays later found LaFell on a medium pass, who turned upfield and raced down the sideline for a 56-yard touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 37-22. The Bills reached their own 42 on their final drive, but a sack by Rob Ninkovich and an incomplete pass intended for Scott Chandler on 4th-and-9 officially sealed the deal. Brady completed 27 of 37 passes for 361 yards, with 4 touchdowns and no interceptions. Kyle Orton was equally very impressive, finishing the game  24 of 38 for 299 yards, with 2 TDs and 1 INT. With 4 catches for 97 yards and 2 touchdowns, LaFell continued to be the Patriots awaited deep-threat at wide receiver. Both teams struggled to run the football. Stevan Ridley ran for only 23 yards on 10 carries, while Fred Jackson ran for only 26 yards on 10 carries. Unfortunately, it was later learned the Patriots lost Stevan Ridley and linebacker Jerod Mayo to season ending injuries.\n\nQUESTION: What yard line did both teams score from?",

In the first quarter, New York took flight as QB Brett Favre completed a 7-yard TD pass to RB Leon Washington.  The Patriots would respond with kicker Stephen Gostkowski getting a 42-yard field goal.  The Jets would increase their lead as kicker Jay Feely made a 22-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New England would answer with Gostkowski making a 31-yard field goal, yet New York immediately replied as Washington returned the kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown.  Later, the Jets added onto their lead as Favre completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery to give the Jets a commanding 24-6 lead. The Patriots would get back into the game by closing out the half with a  QB Matt Cassel 19-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney. In the third quarter, New England hacked away at New York's lead as Cassel completed a 10-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson (along with a 2-point conversion pass to Gaffney) on the final play of the 3rd quarter.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots completely erased the Jets' 18-point lead with Gostkowski kicking a 47-yard field goal.  New York would answer with RB Thomas Jones getting a 1-yard TD run, but New England tied the game with Cassel completing a 16-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss, who had beaten Ty Law as time expired.

The drive included some clutch throws by Favre, particularly a connection with Dustin Keller on 3rd-and-17 from deep in the Jets' zone. It was Favre's 42nd game-winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime in his career. Washington was selected as AFC special teams player of the week for the first time in his career.

On the third play of the Bills resulting possession, though, Kyle Orton was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Patriots 39-yard line. The Patriots marched 61 yards in just five plays to take the lead on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Tim Wright. After both teams punted, the Bills lugged 67 yards in just under 5 minutes to tie the game 7-7 on a Kyle Orton touchdown pass to Robert Woods. After a Patriots three-and-out, Orton was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Jones recovering at the Bills 24. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, however, but Gostkowski was successful on a 42-yard field goal try. With 0:06 seconds left in the half, the Bills were attempting to run out the clock, but McCourty stripped C. J. Spiller with Zach Moore recovering at the Bills 42. Brady hit Edelman on a quick 7 yards pass and Gostkowski kicked a 53-yarder for a 13-7 lead at the half. After receiving the opening kickoff of the second half the Patriots reached the Bills 43 in just five plays before Brady launched a bomb to Brian Tyms for a 43-yard touchdown, increasing the New England lead to 20-7. The Bills struck right back with a 13 play, 80-yard drive in just under 7 minutes, culminating in Fred Jackson scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Patriots marched 56 yards on their next possession with Gostkowski adding a 40-yard field goal to increase the lead to 23-14. After a Bills punt Brady led the Patriots down the field and, with just over 6 minutes remaining, found his favorite target, Gronkowski, for a 17-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for an offensive holding penalty on Jordan Devey. This would prove to just be a delay, because Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to LaFell two plays later, capping a 12 play, 80-yard drive. The Patriots now led 30-14 and looked to be well on their way to victory. However, the Bills wouldn't go away quietly. Kyle Orton calmly engineered an 8 play, 80-yard drive, aided by a 35-yard completion on 4th-and-2, that ended in his 8-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan, with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to one possession, 30-22. Starting at the Patriots 7, Brady converted a 3rd-and-16 with a 17-yard completion to Gronkowski, and a few plays later found LaFell on a medium pass, who turned upfield and raced down the sideline for a 56-yard touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 37-22. The Bills reached their own 42 on their final drive, but a sack by Rob Ninkovich and an incomplete pass intended for Scott Chandler on 4th-and-9 officially sealed the deal. Brady completed 27 of 37 passes for 361 yards, with 4 touchdowns and no interceptions. Kyle Orton was equally very impressive, finishing the game  24 of 38 for 299 yards, with 2 TDs and 1 INT. With 4 catches for 97 yards and 2 touchdowns, LaFell continued to be the Patriots awaited deep-threat at wide receiver. Both teams struggled to run the football. Stevan Ridley ran for only 23 yards on 10 carries, while Fred Jackson ran for only 26 yards on 10 carries.

      "original_passage": "Coming off their dominating home win over the Rams, the Jets flew to Gillette Stadium for a Week 11 AFC East rematch with the New England Patriots on Thursday Night Football.  In the first quarter, New York took flight as QB Brett Favre completed a 7-yard TD pass to RB Leon Washington.  The Patriots would respond with kicker Stephen Gostkowski getting a 42-yard field goal.  The Jets would increase their lead as kicker Jay Feely made a 22-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New England would answer with Gostkowski making a 31-yard field goal, yet New York immediately replied as Washington returned the kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown.  Later, the Jets added onto their lead as Favre completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery to give the Jets a commanding 24-6 lead. The Patriots would get back into the game by closing out the half with a  QB Matt Cassel 19-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney. In the third quarter, New England hacked away at New York's lead as Cassel completed a 10-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson (along with a 2-point conversion pass to Gaffney) on the final play of the 3rd quarter.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots completely erased the Jets' 18-point lead with Gostkowski kicking a 47-yard field goal.  New York would answer with RB Thomas Jones getting a 1-yard TD run, but New England tied the game with Cassel completing a 16-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss, who had beaten Ty Law as time expired.  In overtime,  the Jets took the kickoff and marched straight down the field to win on Feely's 34-yard field goal. The drive included some clutch throws by Favre, particularly a connection with Dustin Keller on 3rd-and-17 from deep in the Jets' zone. It was Favre's 42nd game-winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime in his career. Washington was selected as AFC special teams player of the week for the first time in his career. His 92-yard touchdown was the fourth kick return TD of his career, surpassing Justin Miller for the club record.",

A win would keep alive the Giants' hopes of winning the NFC East. Dallas receiver Roy Williams scored the game's first touchdown in the second quarter, on a 4-yard pass from Romo. Manning responded with a 21-yard shot to Nicks on the ensuing drive. On the Cowboys' next possession, Umenyiora picked up a Marion Barber fumble, which Jacobs later turned into a 1-yard touchdown run. In the third quarter, Romo found Williams in the end zone again, this time for 5 yards. But on the next play from scrimmage, Jacobs caught a 74-yard touchdown for the longest reception of his career. Another Giant set a personal record in the fourth quarter; Hixon's 79-yard punt return was the longest of his career, and it resulted in his second career return touchdown. In a late rally by the Cowboys, Miles Austin caught a 22-yard touchdown pass from Romo, but the ensuing onside kick resulted in a penalty on Sam Hurd for illegal touching and the Giants ran out the clock.

In the summer of 1915, the Ottomans persuaded the Grand Senussi Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi to declare jihad, attack British-occupied Egypt from the west and encourage insurrection in Egypt, to divert British forces from an Ottoman Raid on the Suez Canal from Palestine. The Senussi crossed the Libyan-Egyptian border in November 1915 and fought a campaign along the Egyptian coast, where British Empire forces withdrew, then defeated the Senussi in several engagements, culminating in the Action of Agagia and the re-capture of the coast in March 1916.

Outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware made a big play as he sacked Saints quarterback Drew Brees and caused the ball to be fumbled. Anthony Spencer recovered the ball to put it in Dallas' hands. The Saints only points of the half were from a 43-yard field goal by Garrett Hartley. In the second half, the Cowboys scored their only touchdown in the third quarter with a two-yard touchdown run by Marion Barber. Finally in the fourth quarter New Orleans got a touchdown when running back Mike Bell scored from one yard out to make a 24-10 Dallas lead. Drew Brees also made a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lance Moore. After that, Nick Folk attempted a 24-yard field goal, but the kick was no good. With a big advantage to take the lead as the clock was expiring, the Saints were driving for the game-tying score, but DeMarcus Ware made his second sack on Drew Brees, which again caused the ball to be fumbled. This time the ball was recovered by nose guard Jay Ratliff. With the ball in possession, Dallas took a knee to conclude the game.

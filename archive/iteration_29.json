  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by iteratively extracting constraints, proposing a meeting time, and verifying the proposal against the constraints. The problem is decomposed into three main steps, each handled by a separate function (`extract_constraints`, `propose_meeting_time`, `verify_meeting_time`), acting as specialized agents that use LLM to perform their respective tasks. The `call_llm` function serves as a general interface for calling the Gemini API, used by all other functions to interact with the LLM. The overall workflow involves extracting meeting requirements, generating a potential schedule, and confirming its validity through iterative verification, ultimately returning a proposed meeting time or an error message.",

This suggests the core code execution is stable, but the reasoning and decision-making logic are flawed.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Basic Parsing**: The system appears capable of parsing the input text and extracting at least some information about participants and constraints.\n2.  **Constraint Awareness:** The system seems aware of the basic constraints like meeting duration and work hours.\n3.  **Valid Output Format**: The system consistently produces output in the requested format (\"Proposed Time: ...\").\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Incorrect Constraint Handling**: The system consistently fails to correctly apply all provided constraints when generating the proposed meeting time. This is evident in every error case where the system proposes times that conflict with participant schedules or stated preferences.\n2.  **Preference Ignorance:** The system often ignores stated preferences (e.g., \"Emily would rather not meet on Tuesday,\" \"The group would like to meet at their earliest availability\") in favor of seemingly arbitrary or incorrect time slots.\n3.  **Inaccurate Schedule Interpretation**: The system misinterprets or inaccurately represents the busy schedules of the participants, often suggesting times when participants are explicitly stated to be unavailable.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Constraint Application**: The most critical bottleneck is the inaccurate application of constraints. The system must reliably incorporate all constraints related to participant availability and preferences when determining suitable meeting times.\n2.  **Schedule Conflict Resolution**: Related to constraint application, the system struggles to accurately identify and resolve schedule conflicts between participants.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Ignoring Availability**: A recurring pattern is the system proposing meeting times that directly conflict with the stated unavailability of one or more participants.\n2.  **Ignoring Preferences**: The system consistently fails to prioritize or adhere to explicitly stated scheduling preferences, such as meeting at the earliest availability or avoiding certain days.\n3.  **Arbitrary Time Selection**: In multiple instances, the system seems to select a time slot without clear justification based on the provided constraints. This may indicate a flaw in the solution generation process.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **incorrect and unreliable application of scheduling constraints**. The system fails to accurately represent and enforce the availability and preferences of participants, leading to the selection of invalid or suboptimal meeting times.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling**: The constraint handling mechanism needs significant improvement. This includes ensuring that *all* constraints are correctly identified, represented, and enforced when generating possible solutions.\n2.  **Preference Management**: Implement a more robust system for prioritizing and adhering to stated preferences. This may involve assigning weights to different preferences and using these weights to guide the solution generation process.\n3.  **Schedule Conflict Detection**: Enhance the system's ability to detect and resolve scheduling conflicts between participants. This might involve using a more sophisticated algorithm to identify available time slots and evaluate their suitability based on the constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Constraint Representation**: Implement a structured representation of constraints (e.g., using a data structure or object-oriented approach) to ensure that all relevant information is captured and easily accessible.\n2.  **Constraint Enforcement**: Create a dedicated constraint enforcement module that systematically checks potential solutions against all defined constraints. This module should provide detailed feedback on any constraint violations.\n3.  **Preference Prioritization**: Develop a mechanism for assigning priorities or weights to different scheduling preferences. Use these priorities to guide the solution generation process and select the best possible meeting time. For instance, \"hard constraints\" (like unavailability) have absolute priority, while preferences are \"soft constraints\" that are desirable but not mandatory.\n4.  **Solution Verification Enhancement**: Implement a more robust solution verification process that explicitly checks for constraint violations and preference adherence. This verification step should provide detailed feedback on any issues identified.\n5.  **Implement Few-Shot Learning**: Provide explicit examples of correct constraint reasoning in the system prompt. Show examples of scenarios where participants are unavailable and how the system should respond to these scenarios. Include also cases where preferences should be considered and how they impact the result.\n6.  **Iterative Refinement**: Create an iterative process where the LLM suggests a meeting time and then a separate LLM call verifies if it conflicts with each participant's schedule. If conflicts exist, feed this information back to the LLM to refine its suggestion.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n| Sample ID | Failed Capabilities                                                     |\n| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 0         | constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification         |\n| 1         | constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification         |\n| 2         | constraint_handling, decision_making, solution_verification         |\n| 3         | constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification         |\n| 4         | constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification         |\n| 5         | constraint_handling, decision_making, solution_generation, solution_verification         |\n| 6         | constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification         |\n| 7         | constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification         |\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the provided information, focusing on actionable improvements for the next iteration:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs are consistently formatted, which is a good start. However, all three example outputs demonstrate the core problem: the proposed times are likely incorrect given the constraints (we'd need the problem descriptions to be certain, but given the 0% accuracy this is the most probable reason). The simplicity of the outputs, lacking any explanation or justification for the proposed time, makes it difficult to diagnose *why* the system is failing. It provides no insight into its reasoning process.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently possesses very limited practical scheduling capability. While it can parse input and produce formatted output, it fails to accurately incorporate scheduling constraints. It shows a lack of robust reasoning and conflict resolution abilities. Overall the system displays only rudimentary capability.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** Consistently produces output in the correct format.\n*   **Basic Input Parsing:** Able to identify participants and constraints (to some degree).\n*   **Constraint Awareness:** The system at least recognizes constraints are part of the problem, though it fails to act on them.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Ingestion and Reasoning:** The primary weakness is the inability to internalize and reason with the input. It may be able to identify some constraints, but there's no evidence it uses them to guide its solution.\n*   **Schedule Conflict Resolution:** Fails to identify and resolve schedule conflicts.\n*   **Preference Handling:** Ignores scheduling preferences.\n*    **Lack of Reasoning Explanation:** The inability to describe the reasoning makes debugging very difficult.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **constraint handling and reasoning**. The system needs to accurately internalize constraints, reason about their implications, and use them to generate valid meeting times.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the error analysis and the provided examples, here are specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Hybrid LLM-Code Approach (Refined):**\n    *   **LLM Role:** Use the LLM to:\n        *   Extract all constraints and participant information from the input text *with verification*. The LLM should output a structured representation of the scheduling problem (e.g., JSON)\n        *   Generate a prioritized list of candidate meeting times, explaining its reasoning for each. The reasoning must include clear references to the extracted constraints.\n        *   Verify candidate times against all constraints (see step 2) and provide feedback for refinement if needed.\n    *   **Deterministic Code Role:**\n        *   Implement Python functions to:\n            *   Represent participant schedules and constraints using data structures (e.g., lists of time intervals, dictionaries of preferences).\n            *   Check if a proposed meeting time conflicts with any constraints using deterministic logic.\n2.  **Implement Iterative Refinement with Verification (Few-Shot Learning):**\n\n    *   **Iteration 1:** The LLM generates a proposed meeting time and explains the reasoning, referencing specific constraints.\n    *   **Verification Step:**\n        *   Deterministic code checks the proposed time against all constraints.\n        *   The code generates a detailed conflict report (e.g., \"Conflict with John's schedule on Tuesday from 10:00-11:00\").\n    *   **Iteration 2 (if needed):**\n        *   The conflict report is fed back to the LLM.\n        *   The LLM refines the proposed time, addressing the reported conflicts and explaining its updated reasoning.\n    *   **Stop Condition:** Iterate until a valid meeting time is found or a maximum number of attempts is reached (e.g., 3 iterations).\n\n3.  **Implement Few-Shot Learning:**\n    *   Provide the LLM with 3-5 examples of scheduling problems and their correct solutions.\n    *   In each example, explicitly demonstrate:\n        *   How constraints are identified and extracted.\n        *   How conflicts are resolved.\n        *   How preferences are considered.\n        *   The reasoning process used to arrive at the final solution.\n4.  **Enhanced Output:**\n    *   Modify the output format to *include the reasoning* behind the proposed time. This is critical for debugging. For example:\n        `Proposed Time: Monday, 9:30-10:00 (Chosen because Emily is available from 9:00-12:00, John is available all day, and this is the earliest time slot available).`\n        * Even better would be showing why it *didn't* pick other solutions. Something like \"Didn't pick 9:00-9:30 because Emily requested meeting at their earliest availability, and 9:30 is the earliest time slot possible with the 30 minute duration\".\n\n5.  **Max Attempts:** Make sure to include max attempts on any iterative loops or recursive function calls to prevent unbounded execution.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, capabilities are stable at a very low level (0% accuracy). The next iteration should provide measurable improvements if the recommendations are implemented correctly.\n\nBy focusing on these actionable recommendations, you can create a more robust and reliable scheduling system. Remember, the key is to enable the LLM to reason effectively with the scheduling constraints and to provide visibility into its decision-making process.\n",

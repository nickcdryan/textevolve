  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM with multi-example prompting and verification. The problem is decomposed into analyzing visual features and applying the transformation. The LLM acts as a visual feature analyst and transformation applier. The functions used are `solve_grid_transformation`, `analyze_visual_features`, `apply_transformation`, and `call_llm`. The workflow involves `solve_grid_transformation` calling `analyze_visual_features` to get a transformation description, then `apply_transformation` to generate the final grid, using `call_llm` to interface with the LLM.",

The outputs suggest that the system is producing simplified representations instead of transformed grids, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the task's requirements.\n2.  **Output Format:** The system consistently outputs a `[[8, 7], [6, 5]]` format. This indicates a severe misunderstanding of the expected output, as it should be a grid of the same dimensions as the input grids. This suggests that the task is being misinterpreted as some kind of summarization or dimensionality reduction problem.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Incorrect Pattern Recognition:** The system fails to correctly learn and apply the grid transformation rules from the training examples. It's not recognizing the relationships between input and output grids.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Output Format:** The system generates outputs in an inappropriate format (2x2 matrix) rather than the expected full grid.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe dominant error pattern is the generation of a 2x2 matrix as the output, regardless of the input grid's dimensions or the specific transformation required.

The system is consistently producing a small matrix as output, ignoring the grid structure and specific element-wise transformations demonstrated in the training examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Pattern Recognition/Learning:** The system needs a more robust pattern recognition mechanism to correctly identify relationships between input and output grids in the training examples.\n2.  **Output Generation:** The output generation module needs to be constrained to produce grids of the correct dimensions, matching the input grids. The task requirements must be reinforced: \"Transform the test *grid* according to the pattern...\".\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Re-evaluate Training Strategy:** The training process should be carefully re-evaluated to ensure the system is being trained to learn the correct type of transformation. Augment the training set with more diverse examples or examples that explicitly show the relationship between pixel changes.\n2.  **Explicitly Define Output Shape:** The code should include explicit checks and enforcement of the output grid's shape. Before returning an answer, verify that the output has the same dimensions as the input.\n3.  **Introduce Intermediate Representation:** Consider adding an intermediate representation of the transformation rules. For instance, attempt to express the relationship between input and output cells as a set of mathematical operations or conditional statements.\n4.  **Implement a \"Grid Transformation\" specific module:** Design a module specifically focused on grid transformation. This module should encapsulate the logic for analyzing training examples, identifying patterns in element changes, and applying those patterns to new grids.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracts the grid).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (doesn't enforce output grid dimensions).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generates incorrect matrix instead of grid).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (doesn't verify output against task requirements).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selects an inappropriate matrix).\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracts the grid).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (doesn't enforce output grid dimensions).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generates incorrect matrix instead of grid).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (doesn't verify output against task requirements).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selects an inappropriate matrix).\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracts the grid).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (doesn't enforce output grid dimensions).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generates incorrect matrix instead of grid).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (doesn't verify output against task requirements).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selects an inappropriate matrix).\n",

It can parse the input and output the result in the defined format, but it fails to perform the actual transformation.  It struggles significantly with:\n\n*   **Understanding Task Requirements:** The system profoundly misunderstands the nature of the task (grid transformation).\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Application:** It cannot identify patterns in training examples and apply them to new inputs.\n*   **Output Generation:** The system produces outputs that violate the fundamental constraints of the task (grid dimensions).\n\nOverall, the system is functioning at a near-zero level of competency for this particular task.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Parsing Ability:** The system can successfully parse input and output within defined markers. This is an important baseline capability.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Application (CRITICAL):** The inability to learn and apply transformation rules is the most significant weakness.  It's the core function the system is failing to perform.\n*   **Output Format Enforcement (CRITICAL):**  The failure to produce an output grid of the correct dimensions undermines the entire process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **PATTERN RECOGNITION AND APPLICATION**.  Until the system can correctly identify and apply transformation rules, it will not be able to solve these problems.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere's a list of actionable recommendations, prioritized by impact and ease of implementation:\n\n1.  **Implement Output Shape Validation:**  *Before* outputting the grid, add code to *explicitly verify* that the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.  If it doesn't, raise an error or return a default grid.  This is a simple, high-impact fix.\n2.  **Debug Hardcoded Output:**  Trace the execution path to understand *why* the system is consistently outputting `[[8, 7], [6, 5]]`.  This suggests a critical flaw in the logic or a hardcoded result used for testing that was not removed. Remove any and all hardcoded values.\n3.  **Simplify the Problem (for Debugging):** Create a drastically simplified version of the task with trivial transformations (e.g., \"invert the colors,\" \"shift all pixels one position to the right\").  This will make it easier to debug the pattern recognition and application logic. Start with a very small grid (2x2 or 3x3) for easier visualization.\n4.  **Focus on a Single Transformation Type:** Initially focus on training the system for one specific *type* of grid transformation (e.g., color mapping, rotation, reflection).  Once it masters that, gradually introduce more complexity.\n5.  **Visualize Intermediate Steps:**  Insert debugging code to print out the intermediate representations of the grids and the identified transformation rules.  This will help understand where the system is going wrong.\n6.  **Review Training Data:** Ensure the training data is correctly formatted and that the input-output pairs are clear and consistent. It might also be beneficial to create synthetic training data that highlight the specific transformations.\n7.  **Isolate and Test Pattern Recognition Module:** Isolate the pattern recognition module and thoroughly test it with various input/output pairs to see if it's capable of identifying the correct transformations.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **STABLE (at a very low level)**.  Without significant changes to the core logic, the system is unlikely to improve.  It's effectively producing random output that happens to be in a matrix form.\n",

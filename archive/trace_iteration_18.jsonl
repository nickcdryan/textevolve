You will take the given transformation rule and iteratively improve it to ensure accuracy and generalizability."}, "output": "Okay, I will now focus on refining the **Reverse Transformation Rule**. The initial version was good, but let's make it more precise and robust.\n\n**Current Reverse Transformation Rule:**\n\n1.  Divide the 9x9 grid into nine 3x3 blocks.\n2.  For each 3x3 block, take the value of any cell within the block (since they are all the same) and assign it to the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid.\n\n**Refinements and Considerations:**\n\n*   **Input Validation:** The rule assumes the input is *always* a 9x9 grid and that all cells within each 3x3 block *are always the same*. We should add a check for this, or at least acknowledge the potential for errors if this isn't true.  If the input isn't valid, we could either return an error, or define a specific behavior (e.g., taking the most frequent value in the block).\n*   **Explicit Indexing:**  Using explicit row and column indices will make the rule clearer and less ambiguous.\n*   **Error Handling (Optional):** While not strictly necessary, we could include a mechanism to handle cases where the 3x3 blocks don't have uniform values.\n\n**Refined Reverse Transformation Rule (with Error Handling):**\n\nGiven a 9x9 input grid, create a 3x3 output grid.\n\n1.  **Input Validation:** Verify that the input grid is indeed 9x9. If not, return an error or a predefined null value.\n2.  **Iterate through Blocks:** For each cell (i, j) in the *output* 3x3 grid (where i and j range from 0 to 2):\n    *   Define the corresponding 3x3 block in the *input* 9x9 grid.  This block will have its top-left corner at position (3\\*i, 3\\*j).\n    *   **Value Extraction:**\n        *   Check that all the values inside corresponding 3x3 block are equal.\n        *   If equal, assign that value to output grid.\n        *   If *not* equal (error condition), return an error or an indication of inconsistency (e.g., a special \"undefined\" value). Alternatively, choose the most frequent value in the 3x3 block and proceed with a warning.\n\n**Python-like Implementation (Illustrative):**\n\n```python\ndef reverse_transform(input_grid):\n    if len(input_grid) != 9 or any(len(row) != 9 for row in input_grid):\n        return \"Error: Input grid must be 9x9\" # Input Validation\n\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n\n    for i in range(3): # Output row\n        for j in range(3): # Output col\n            block_values = []\n            for row in range(3*i, 3*i + 3):\n                for col in range(3*j, 3*j + 3):\n                    block_values.append(input_grid[row][col])\n\n            #Check uniformity\n            if len(set(block_values)) != 1:\n                return \"Error: Inconsistent 3x3 block at position ({}, {})\".format(i, j) # Error condition\n\n            output_grid[i][j] = block_values[0] # All values are the same, so take the first\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n**Why these refinements are important:**\n\n*   **Robustness:** The rule now explicitly handles invalid inputs, making it more reliable.\n*   **Clarity:** The use of indices makes the logic easier to follow.\n*   **Completeness:** The error handling makes the rule more complete by considering edge cases.\n\n**Final Answer: Refined Reverse Transformation Rule:**\n\nGiven a 9x9 input grid, create a 3x3 output grid.\n\n1.  **Input Validation:** Verify that the input grid is indeed 9x9. If not, return an error.\n2.  **Iterate through Blocks:** For each cell (i, j) in the output 3x3 grid (where i and j range from 0 to 2):\n    *   Define the corresponding 3x3 block in the input 9x9 grid, starting at position (3\\*i, 3\\*j).\n    *   **Value Extraction and Validation:**\n        *   Verify that all the values within the 3x3 block are equal. If they are not, return an error.\n        *   If all values are equal, assign that value to the output_grid[i][j].\n3.  Return the resulting 3x3 output grid.\n", "status": "success"}

I need to analyze the provided transformation rule based on the training examples, identify its shortcomings, refine it for better accuracy and generalizability, and also provide a reverse transformation.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the current rule:\n\n**Current Transformation Rule:** The transformation rule is to expand the original grid into a 9x9 grid where each cell in the original grid is expanded into a 3x3 block in the new grid, with the value of the original cell populating the entire corresponding block.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe current rule seems accurate based on the provided training examples. Each input grid cell's value is replicated into a 3x3 block in the output grid. The output grid is always 9x9 since the input grids are all 3x3.\n\n**Reverse Transformation Rule:**\n\nTo reverse this transformation, we need to take a 9x9 grid and collapse it into a 3x3 grid. The value of each cell in the 3x3 grid would be the value of the corresponding 3x3 block in the 9x9 grid.\n\nReverse Rule:\n1. Divide the 9x9 grid into nine 3x3 blocks.\n2. For each 3x3 block, take the value of any cell within the block (since they are all the same) and assign it to the corresponding cell in the 3x3 output grid.\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe initial rule is already quite precise. So, to enhance clarity and formality, I'll rephrase it slightly and include information on input and output dimensions:\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule:**\n\nGiven a 3x3 input grid, create a 9x9 output grid.  Each cell (i, j) in the input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output grid, starting at position (3*i, 3*j).  The value of the input cell (i, j) is replicated across all cells within its corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid.\n\n**Applying the Refined Transformation Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nTest Input:\n```\n[\n  [7, 0, 7]\n  [7, 0, 7]\n  [7, 7, 0]\n]\n```\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n[\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]\n  [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7]\n  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n  [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Explanation of applying the rule to the test input:**\n\n*   Input cell (0,0) = 7.

I need to analyze the given transformation rule, refine it based on the training examples, and provide a reverse transformation rule. Let's start by analyzing the current rule and the provided examples.\n\n**Current Transformation Rule:** In each row, fill the empty cells (0) between the first and last non-zero numbers with a '5'.\n\n**Analysis of the Rule and Examples:**\n\nThe rule seems to capture the core logic. It identifies the first and last non-zero elements in each row and fills the intervening zeros with 5.\n\n*   **Example 1:** The first non-zero is 1, the last is 2. The zeros between them are replaced by 5.\n*   **Example 2:** The first non-zero is 3, the last is 7. The zeros between them are replaced by 5.\n\n**Refinement of the Rule:**\n\nThe current rule is functionally correct and clear. However, for better clarity and explicitness, we can rephrase it:\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule:** For each row in the grid, identify the indices of the first and last non-zero elements. If such elements exist, replace all elements between these indices (inclusive of the start and end indices) with the value 5, with the exception of the first and last non-zero elements themselves which should remain unchanged.\n\n**Reverse Transformation Rule:**\n\nTo reverse the transformation, we need to identify the '5's that were added and revert them back to '0's.  However, we need to be careful not to revert the original 5's that may have been in the input.\n\n**Reverse Transformation Rule:** For each row in the grid, locate the first and last non-zero elements. Then, iterate from the index after the first non-zero element to the index before the last non-zero element. Replace any '5' found in this range with '0'.\n\n**Applying the Refined Rule and Reverse Rule to the Test Input:**\n\n**Test Input:**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n]\n```\n\n**Applying the Refined Transformation Rule:**\n\n*   **Row 1:** No non-zero elements, so no change.\n*   **Row 2:** First non-zero is 4 (index 0), last non-zero is 8 (index 10).  Replace elements between indices 1 and 9 inclusive with 5.\n*   **Row 3:** No non-zero elements, so no change.\n*   **Row 4:** No non-zero elements, so no change.\n*   **Row 5:** First non-zero is 6 (index 0), last non-zero is 9 (index 10). Replace elements between indices 1 and 9 inclusive with 5.\n\n**Transformed Output:**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [6, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9]\n]\n```\n\n**Applying the Reverse Transformation Rule:**\n\nLet's apply the reverse transformation to the transformed output above to see if we get back the original test input.\n\n*   **Row 1:** No non-zero elements, no change.\n*   **Row 2:** First non-zero is 4 (index 0), last non-zero is 8 (index 10).  Iterate from index 1 to 9. Replace any 5's with 0.\n*   **Row 3:** No non-zero elements, no change.\n*   **Row 4:** No non-zero elements, no change.\n*   **Row 5:** First non-zero is 6 (index 0), last non-zero is 9 (index 10). Iterate from index 1 to 9. Replace any 5's with 0.\n\n**Reversed Output:**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n]\n```\n\nThe reverse transformation successfully recovers the original test input.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule:** For each row in the grid, identify the indices of the first and last non-zero elements. If such elements exist, replace all elements between these indices (inclusive of the start and end indices) with the value 5, with the exception of the first and last non-zero elements themselves which should remain unchanged.\n\n**Reverse Transformation Rule:** For each row in the grid, locate the first and last non-zero elements. Then, iterate from the index after the first non-zero element to the index before the last non-zero element. Replace any '5' found in this range with '0'.\n\n\n    Example:\n    Problem:\n    Input Grid: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n    Transformation Rule: Reverse each row.\n    Transformed Grid: [[2, 1], [4, 3]]\n\n    Transformed Grid:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are a highly skilled transformation agent.

You will take the given transformation rule and iteratively improve it to ensure accuracy and generalizability."}, "output": "Okay, I agree with the refined transformation rule. It seems accurate and well-defined. Now, let's work on the reverse transformation rule. As I mentioned before, perfectly reversing the transformation is impossible because we've lost the original values that were replaced by zeros. Therefore, the reverse transformation will focus on *introducing* zeros.\n\n**Understanding the Challenge**\n\nThe core challenge is that the forward transformation is *lossy*.  We can't perfectly reconstruct the original grid from the transformed grid. Any reverse transformation will necessarily be an approximation or involve making arbitrary choices about where to introduce zeros.\n\n**Reverse Transformation Rule (Introducing Zeros):**\n\nThe most sensible approach for a reverse transformation is to introduce zeros in a way that, if the *forward* transformation were applied, it would result in something *similar* to the original transformed grid.  We can't guarantee an exact match, but we can aim for a reasonable approximation.\n\nHere's a possible reverse transformation rule:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n1.  **Decide on a \"zeroing probability\" (e.g., 20%).** This determines how likely we are to replace a non-zero value with zero. This probability should be a hyperparameter of the reverse transformation.\n\n2.  **Iterate through each cell in the row.**\n\n3.  **Generate a random number between 0 and 1.**\n\n4.  **If the random number is less than the zeroing probability:**\n\n    *   Replace the current cell's value with 0.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   This rule randomly introduces zeros into the grid. The `zeroing probability` controls the density of zeros that are introduced.\n*   Applying the *forward* transformation after this reverse transformation will *tend* to fill in the introduced zeros with values similar to their neighbors (because that's how the forward transformation works).\n*   Higher values of the `zeroing probability` will result in more zeros and a greater change from the original transformed grid.\n*   Lower values will result in fewer changes and a closer approximation to the original transformed grid.\n\n**Why this approach?**\n\n*   **Simplicity:** It's relatively easy to implement.\n*   **Control:** The `zeroing probability` allows you to control the degree of \"reversal\".\n*   **Plausibility:** It creates zeros that, when filled in by the forward transformation, will result in values that are contextually similar to the existing values in the row.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n*   This is not a *true* reverse. It's more of a \"zero introducer.\"\n*   The resulting grid after applying the forward and reverse transformations will not be identical to the original transformed grid.\n*   The choice of the `zeroing probability` is critical and may require experimentation to find a suitable value.\n\n**Complete Answer:**\n\n```\nRefined Transformation Rule (Forward):\nFor each row in the grid:\n1. Iterate through the cells from left to right.\n2. If a cell contains a '0':\n    a. Count the number of non-zero values to its left in the current row.\n    b. If the count is zero, replace the '0' with '1'.\n    c. Otherwise, replace the '0' with the value at index `(current_column_index % non_zero_count)` in the current row.\n\nReverse Transfomation Rule (Introducing Zeros):\nFor each row in the grid:\n1.  Choose a zeroing probability (e.g., 0.2). This is a hyperparameter that controls the density of introduced zeros.\n2.  Iterate through each cell in the row.\n3.

test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples.\n    Transformation Rule: Okay, I understand the task. I need to analyze the provided examples, identify the transformation rule being applied, and then refine that rule to be as accurate and generalizable as possible. I will also provide a reverse transformation rule to verify my understanding of the transformation.\n\nLet's analyze the examples.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   The output grids are the same as the input grids, except for the zero values.\n*   In the output grids, the zero values in the input grids are replaced with values such that the columns are made to look like the non-zero columns.\n\n**Initial Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe transformation rule appears to be to replace zeros in the grid with non-zero values from earlier columns within the row, effectively filling in the gaps based on repeating patterns. Let's try to be more precise. The values are replaced by taking the mod of the column index with respect to the number of non-zero elements to the left in the row.\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule:**\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n1.  Iterate through the cells from left to right.\n2.  If a cell contains a '0', find the index of the first non-zero value to its left.\n3.  Fill the zero with the value obtained by (column\\_index modulo non\\_zero\\_count).\n\n**Reverse Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe reverse transformation is impossible since we do not know what the previous values were. The reverse transformation should be more along the lines of introducing zero values at specific locations.\n\n**Let's test this refined rule against the examples, step-by-step:**\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput:\n\n```\n[\n  [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n  [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n  [1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 0, 0, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5]\n  [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 0, 0, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2]\n  [1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4]\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n  [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5]\n  [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2]\n  [1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5]\n  [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 1, 4, 2]\n  [1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4]\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]\n  [1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5]\n]\n```\n\nRow 1:  `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`\n\n*   The first zero at index 3. non\\_zero\\_count = 3. value = grid\\[row]\\[3 % 3] = grid\\[row]\\[0] = 1\n*   The second zero at index 4. non\\_zero\\_count = 3. value = grid\\[row]\\[4 % 3] = grid\\[row]\\[1] = 1\n\nThis matches the output.

Only replace empty spaces if there is a non-zero number in the original grid.\" is too simplistic. It doesn't explain:\n\n*   How far the '3' extends.\n*   The specific pattern of replacement surrounding the non-zero numbers.\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule (Attempt 1):**\n\n1.  **Preserve Non-Zero Values:** Iterate through the input grid and copy all non-zero values and their positions directly to the output grid.\n\n2.  **Surround with '3':** Iterate through the output grid. For each cell containing a non-zero value, examine its neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals). If a neighbor is a zero, replace it with '3'. Repeat this for values in a wider range.\n\n3.  **Fill Remaining Zeroes:** After the neighbor replacement, any remaining zeroes in the output grid should also be changed to '3'.\n\n**Reverse Transformation Rule (Attempt 1):**\n\n1.  **Preserve Non-Zero Values:** Iterate through the output grid, copy all non-zero values to the input grid.

The reverse rule also doesn't guarantee perfectly recreating the original input if the '3' area overlaps between different non-zero values.\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule (Attempt 2):**\n\n1.  **Preserve Non-Zero Values:** Copy non-zero values from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.\n\n2. **Iterate and Replace:** Iterate through the entire grid.

I need to analyze the provided training examples, identify the underlying transformation logic, and then refine the given transformation rule to accurately reflect that logic. I also need to provide a reverse transformation rule.\n\nLet's analyze the examples:\n\n**Observations from Training Examples:**\n\n*   The core change involves replacing zeroes with '3', but only in areas surrounding non-zero numbers.\n*   The non-zero numbers themselves are preserved in their original locations.\n*   The \"area of influence\" of a non-zero number seems to extend outwards, potentially filling adjacent zeroes. It's not just direct neighbors; sometimes it extends further.\n*   The values of the non-zero numbers are also present in the output grid\n*   The '3' seems to act as a border or background.\n\n**Critique of Current Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe current rule \"Replace all non-zero numbers in the input grid with themselves and fill the empty spaces (zeroes) with '3'. Only replace empty spaces if there is a non-zero number in the original grid.\" is too simplistic. It doesn't explain:\n\n*   How far the '3' extends.\n*   The specific pattern of replacement surrounding the non-zero numbers.\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule (Attempt 1):**\n\n1.  **Preserve Non-Zero Values:** Iterate through the input grid and copy all non-zero values and their positions directly to the output grid.\n\n2.  **Surround with '3':** Iterate through the output grid. For each cell containing a non-zero value, examine its neighbors (up, down, left, right, and diagonals). If a neighbor is a zero, replace it with '3'. Repeat this for values in a wider range.\n\n3.  **Fill Remaining Zeroes:** After the neighbor replacement, any remaining zeroes in the output grid should also be changed to '3'.\n\n**Reverse Transformation Rule (Attempt 1):**\n\n1.  **Preserve Non-Zero Values:** Iterate through the output grid, copy all non-zero values to the input grid. Store their positions.\n2.  **Replace '3' with '0':** Replace all '3' with '0' in the input grid.\n\n**Analysis of Attempt 1 and Reverse Rule:**\nThis is still a bit vague. The \"examine its neighbors\" part needs to be more precise. The reverse rule also doesn't guarantee perfectly recreating the original input if the '3' area overlaps between different non-zero values.\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule (Attempt 2):**\n\n1.  **Preserve Non-Zero Values:** Copy non-zero values from the input grid to the corresponding positions in the output grid.\n\n2. **Iterate and Replace:** Iterate through the entire grid. For each cell, check if the original input grid had any non-zero value in its 3x3 neighbourhood, replace the corresponding cell in the output grid with the original value. Fill the rest with 3.\n**Reverse Transformation Rule (Attempt 2):**\n\n1.  **Preserve Non-Zero Values:** Iterate through the output grid, copy all non-zero values to the input grid, and store their positions.\n2.  **Replace '3' with '0':** Replace all '3' with '0' in the input grid.\n\n**Analysis of Attempt 2 and Reverse Rule:**\nThis second attempt is more precise and addresses the neighbor issue with a fixed 3x3 area. The reverse rule remains the same, but its effectiveness is improved by the refined transformation.\n\n**Refined Transformation Rule (Attempt 3):**\n\n1.  **Create Output Grid:** Create a new grid of the same dimensions as the input grid and fill it entirely with the value `3`.\n2.  **Copy Non-Zero Values:** Iterate through the input grid.  If a cell contains a non-zero value, copy that value to the corresponding cell in the output grid.\n**Reverse Transformation Rule (Attempt 3):**\n\n1.  **Copy Non-Zero Values:** Iterate through the output grid, copy all non-zero values to the input grid. Replace the rest with '0'.\n2.  **Fill the Rest:** Fill the rest of the input grid with 0.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\nOkay, let's apply the Refined Transformation Rule (Attempt 3) to the test input:\n\n**Test Input:**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n1.  **Create Output Grid (filled with 3):**\n\n```\n[\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n]\n```\n\n2.  **Copy Non-Zero Values:**\n\n```\n[\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n]\n```\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```\n[\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n]\n```\n\n    Example:\n    Problem:\n    Input Grid: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n    Transformation Rule: Reverse each row.\n    Transformed Grid: [[2, 1], [4, 3]]\n\n    Transformed Grid:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are a highly skilled transformation agent.

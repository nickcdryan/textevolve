  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using a \"Meta-Pattern Extraction and Transformation\" approach, leveraging multi-example prompting and the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into three main steps: extracting the transformation intent, identifying the meta-pattern, and applying the transformation, using the LLM for each. The agent acts as an expert at identifying and applying grid transformation patterns.\n\nThe main functions used are `main`, `solve_grid_transformation`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function calls the `solve_grid_transformation` function to start the process, which then sequentially calls `call_llm` with different prompts to extract intent, identify the meta-pattern, and generate the transformed grid. The overall workflow involves feeding a problem to the LLM, extracting the transformation intent, identifying the meta-pattern, and then applying the transformation based on the intent and meta-pattern, with the `call_llm` function handling the LLM interaction.",

      "output": "Transformation Intent: The transformation appears to involve localized averaging or smoothing, where elements in the grid are influenced by their immediate neighbors. More specifically, values within certain blocks or regions seem to be getting averaged or replaced with dominant values found within those local neighborhoods. The specific neighborhood and replacement logic may vary between examples. Looking at Example 4, it can be seen that it's not simply averaging values in neighborhoods, some transformations happen column-wise or row-wise. Thus, the transformation is to smooth the grid while preserving the edges.\n\nMeta-Pattern: Smoothing with Edge Preservation\n\nTransformed Grid: ```python\ndef solve():\n    input_grid = [\n

        "output": "Transformation Intent: The transformation appears to involve localized averaging or smoothing, where elements in the grid are influenced by their immediate neighbors. More specifically, values within certain blocks or regions seem to be getting averaged or replaced with dominant values found within those local neighborhoods. The specific neighborhood and replacement logic may vary between examples. Looking at Example 4, it can be seen that it's not simply averaging values in neighborhoods, some transformations happen column-wise or row-wise. Thus, the transformation is to smooth the grid while preserving the edges.\n\nMeta-Pattern: Smoothing with Edge Preservation\n\nTransformed Grid: ```python\ndef solve():\n    input_grid = [\n

This is evident in the incorrect transformation applied in error case 1.\n*   **Inability to generalize to unseen grids:** The system struggles to apply the learnt transformation rules to new grids, even when the grids follow the same pattern (error case 1).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inaccurate pattern recognition and rule extraction:** The system fails to accurately identify and extract the exact rules governing the grid transformations. It often oversimplifies or misinterprets the relationships between the input and output grids.\n*   **Poor mapping of transformation rules to code:** Even with the right transformation recognised, the code generated sometimes doesn't correctly implement it - most obvious in how the output grid in example 1 has little to no similarity with the golden answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of local vs. global transformations:** The system sometimes focuses on local patterns without understanding the global structure of the transformation (e.g. local 'smoothing', when global structure is conserved).\n*   **Incorrect replication/shifting implementations:** Even when a general direction is correct, the specific implementation has significant deviations - the program generated fails to correspond with the expected output.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inaccurate extraction and implementation of grid transformation rules from the training examples. It fails to translate observed patterns into precise and robust code that can be generalized to unseen input grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Enhanced Pattern Recognition:** Develop more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms that can identify complex relationships between grid elements.\n*   **Rule Extraction:** Design a mechanism to extract explicit transformation rules from training examples. This could involve representing transformations as symbolic expressions or using a more structured representation.\n*   **Code Generation:** Improve the mapping from extracted rules to code. This could involve using a code generation template or a more advanced synthesis technique.\n*   **Verification:** The generated code should also have a component which validates the code, and compares that to the expected output before delivering.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Introduce a symbolic representation:** Represent grid transformations using symbolic expressions. For instance, represent averaging or shifting operations using mathematical notation.\n*   **Implement a rule learning algorithm:** Use a rule learning algorithm to automatically extract transformation rules from the training examples. This could involve using techniques from inductive logic programming or program synthesis.\n*   **Refine code generation templates:** Develop more specific and detailed code generation templates that can accurately translate extracted rules into code.\n*   **Implement a rule validation step:** Use some simple sanity checks after code generation.

However, the transformation applied is incorrect. The system correctly identifies \"Element Displacement\" as the Meta-Pattern, however the code places the shifted elements in the *wrong* position. The intended logic was not correctly translated.

However, it struggles to accurately interpret transformation rules, generalize to unseen grids, and precisely translate rules into functional code. The system correctly recognizes Meta-Patterns, but translating this into the correct algorithm is the biggest issue. There is also no safety net to catch very obvious issues.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Meta-Pattern Recognition:** Consistent identification of the general transformation type (e.g., Element Displacement, Tiling, Smoothing).\n*   **Syntactically Correct Code Generation:** The system reliably produces Python code free of syntax errors, providing a solid base for further development.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Rule Extraction & Implementation:** The system fails to accurately capture and implement the *specific* transformation rules governing the input and output grids. This is the core issue driving errors.\n*   **Lack of Generalization:** The system struggles to apply learned transformation rules to new, unseen grid configurations, even when following the same pattern.\n*   **Insufficient Solution Verification:** The system lacks an internal verification mechanism to assess the correctness of the generated code and its output. Obvious mistakes are not flagged.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\n*   **Accurate Rule Extraction & Implementation:** This is the **most critical area** to improve. A precise understanding of the transformation, and the ability to translate that into the correct code is the core issue.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Symbolic Rule Representation:**\n    *   **Implementation:** Introduce a system to represent transformation rules using symbolic expressions (e.g., mathematical notation for shifting, averaging, replication).\n    *   **Rationale:** This will provide a more precise and machine-readable representation of the rules, facilitating accurate code generation.\n\n2.  **Rule Learning Algorithm:**\n    *   **Implementation:** Integrate a rule learning algorithm (e.g., inductive logic programming, program synthesis) to automatically extract transformation rules from training examples.\n    *   **Rationale:** Automating the rule extraction process will reduce reliance on manual encoding and improve the system's ability to learn complex transformations.\n\n3.  **Code Generation Templates with Finer Granularity:**\n    *   **Implementation:** Refine the existing code generation templates to be more specific and detailed. Create templates tailored to different types of transformations (e.g., shifting, averaging, tiling) with customizable parameters.\n    *   **Rationale:** Finer-grained templates will improve the accuracy of the code generation process by providing more precise instructions for translating rules into code.\n\n4.  **Solution Verification Step:**\n    *   **Implementation:** Implement a verification module that assesses the generated code and its output against the expected behavior. This could involve sanity checks to identify gross errors, comparing statistical properties of the input and output grids (e.g. mean, standard deviation), or using simpler rule based pattern matching.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will help the system identify and correct errors before delivering the solution, improving overall accuracy. The verifier needs to confirm that there is any resemblance at all.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **stable with marginal improvement**. The system shows a basic understanding of grid transformations, but its inability to accurately extract and implement rules, coupled with the lack of solution verification, limits its overall effectiveness. Implementing the recommended improvements should drive a positive trend in future iterations.\n",

This is evident in the incorrect transformation applied in error case 1.\n*   **Inability to generalize to unseen grids:** The system struggles to apply the learnt transformation rules to new grids, even when the grids follow the same pattern (error case 1).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inaccurate pattern recognition and rule extraction:** The system fails to accurately identify and extract the exact rules governing the grid transformations. It often oversimplifies or misinterprets the relationships between the input and output grids.\n*   **Poor mapping of transformation rules to code:** Even with the right transformation recognised, the code generated sometimes doesn't correctly implement it - most obvious in how the output grid in example 1 has little to no similarity with the golden answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of local vs. global transformations:** The system sometimes focuses on local patterns without understanding the global structure of the transformation (e.g. local 'smoothing', when global structure is conserved).\n*   **Incorrect replication/shifting implementations:** Even when a general direction is correct, the specific implementation has significant deviations - the program generated fails to correspond with the expected output.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inaccurate extraction and implementation of grid transformation rules from the training examples. It fails to translate observed patterns into precise and robust code that can be generalized to unseen input grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Enhanced Pattern Recognition:** Develop more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms that can identify complex relationships between grid elements.\n*   **Rule Extraction:** Design a mechanism to extract explicit transformation rules from training examples. This could involve representing transformations as symbolic expressions or using a more structured representation.\n*   **Code Generation:** Improve the mapping from extracted rules to code. This could involve using a code generation template or a more advanced synthesis technique.\n*   **Verification:** The generated code should also have a component which validates the code, and compares that to the expected output before delivering.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Introduce a symbolic representation:** Represent grid transformations using symbolic expressions. For instance, represent averaging or shifting operations using mathematical notation.\n*   **Implement a rule learning algorithm:** Use a rule learning algorithm to automatically extract transformation rules from the training examples. This could involve using techniques from inductive logic programming or program synthesis.\n*   **Refine code generation templates:** Develop more specific and detailed code generation templates that can accurately translate extracted rules into code.\n*   **Implement a rule validation step:** Use some simple sanity checks after code generation.

Are numbers consistent?\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to accurately extract transformation rules.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated incorrect code based on the misinterpretation of the rules.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed to recognize the solution deviated significantly.\n",

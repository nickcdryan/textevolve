  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting meeting information using an LLM with multi-example prompting and verification, and then scheduling the meeting with another LLM, incorporating extracted info and question context. The `extract_meeting_info` function extracts details, while the `schedule_meeting` function proposes a valid meeting time and validates it. The `call_llm` function serves as an interface to the Gemini LLM. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `extract_meeting_info` and `schedule_meeting` sequentially to first extract the information, then generate a meeting schedule.",

There are no explicit `JSONDecodeError` or `TypeError` errors, but the \"Extraction failed\" message hints at a parsing or logical error during information extraction.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system correctly identifies that Mason and Evelyn are free the entire day.\n2.  The system attempts to find the intersection of available times for all participants, demonstrating a general understanding of the problem.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system fails to correctly extract and represent Jose's schedule constraints, specifically regarding the time after which he cannot meet. The prompt makes it obvious and this failure leads to a cascading effect on subsequent reasoning.\n2.  The system seems to arbitrarily choose one of the valid time slots instead of applying a more sophisticated decision-making process, which leads to an incorrect proposed time slot.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Inaccurate extraction of participant schedules and constraints is a critical bottleneck. This leads to incorrect calculations and incorrect candidate time slots.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** The system fails to effectively incorporate all constraints during information extraction itself.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary error pattern is inaccurate information extraction, particularly related to correctly interpreting and representing constraints on availability. This results in incorrect reasoning about available time slots.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the failure to accurately extract and represent constraints on participant schedules during the initial information extraction phase. The \"Jose can not meet on Monday after 15:30\" constraint is explicitly provided and should have been incorporated into Jose's availability from the beginning.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the robustness and accuracy of information extraction, especially regarding constraints. This can be done with more sophisticated prompting and LLM architectures.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** Strengthen the constraint handling mechanism to ensure all constraints are actively considered. This can be done by explicitly representing all constraints and the steps taken to enforce them, instead of just modifying available times.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhance Information Extraction Prompt:** Refine the information extraction prompt to specifically request the extraction of constraints, including those limiting availability windows. Include more diverse examples of constraints in the prompt's few-shot examples.\n2.  **Explicit Constraint Representation:** Introduce an explicit representation of constraints separate from availability. For instance, the system could maintain a list of constraints like `{\"participant\": \"Jose\", \"type\": \"unavailable_after\", \"time\": \"15:30\"}`.\n3.  **Verification Step for Extraction:** Add a verification step immediately after information extraction to check that all stated constraints have been correctly captured. If any constraint is missing, re-prompt the extraction process with specific feedback.\n4.  **Add reasoning before picking the answer:** Instead of arbitrarily choosing one of the time slots, have the system explain the rationale behind choosing the answer. This will help in debugging this specific component of the reasoning, and also improve answer quality.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed\n    *   solution_generation: Partially failed (generated a valid time but not the correct one)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (arbitrarily chose time slot)\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the provided information, with a focus on actionable improvements:\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\n*   **Sample 1:** Correctly identifies available slots for Amy and Kevin and proposes a valid meeting time. The reasoning is clear and step-by-step.\n*   **Sample 2:**  Experiences a clear information extraction failure. The \"Extraction failed\" message explicitly indicates the system *knows* it has missed a constraint (\"Jose can not meet on Monday after 15:30\"). Despite knowing the schedule is incorrect, the system proceeds with flawed data, leading to an incorrect final suggestion. This suggests a failure to halt execution and re-attempt extraction when errors are detected. The choice of 12:30-13:00 or 15:00-15:30 is an arbitrary choice that suggests a lack of sophistication in the final decision.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system demonstrates a moderate capability for scheduling meetings when provided with clean, accurate information. However, it is highly susceptible to errors stemming from inaccurate information extraction, particularly related to constraints.  It exhibits limited error handling and recovery. The reasoning component works adequately when the extracted data is correct, but lacks robustness to handle incomplete or inaccurate information.  Final decision-making is simplistic.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Reasoning with Available Times:** The system can successfully reason about the intersection of available times when given accurate input.\n*   **Clear Step-by-Step Reasoning (in Correct Cases):** The system presents its reasoning in a relatively clear, step-by-step manner when extraction is correct, which aids in understanding and debugging.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The error case indicates that the system *can* identify missing constraints during the extraction process.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Information Extraction (Constraints):** The primary weakness is the inaccurate extraction of scheduling constraints. This is a critical failure point.\n*   **Error Handling and Recovery:** The system fails to halt execution and re-attempt extraction when constraint extraction errors are detected, continuing with incorrect information.\n*   **Constraint Enforcement:** There's no explicit mechanism to ensure constraints are enforced throughout the reasoning process.\n*   **Arbitrary Decision-Making:** The system arbitrarily chooses time slots instead of using more sophisticated selection criteria.\n*   **Lack of Sophistication in Decision-Making:** The system lacks a sophisticated approach to choosing the *best* time slot, merely settling for a valid one.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction Accuracy**, with a particular emphasis on robustly extracting and representing constraints on participant availability.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Enhanced Information Extraction Prompt & Examples (Exploitation):** Refine the information extraction prompt to be more specific and include more diverse examples of availability constraints.  The examples should demonstrate how to handle constraints that limit availability windows (e.g., \"not after 3:30 PM\").  Exploit the current extraction logic but enhance it with these better prompts.\n2.  **Explicit Constraint Representation (Exploration):**  Implement an explicit representation of constraints as separate data structures.  For example:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"participants\": {\n        \"Jose\": {\n          \"available\": [\"9:00-17:00\"],\n          \"constraints\": [\n            {\"type\": \"unavailable_after\", \"time\": \"15:30\"}\n          ]\n        }\n        // Other participants\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This requires exploration to implement a new representation.\n3.  **Verification Loop with Specific Feedback (Exploration):** Implement a verification loop *immediately* after information extraction.  The verification should specifically check for the presence and correct interpretation of all stated constraints. Use the LLM to identify any missing or misinterpreted constraints, and provide targeted feedback to the extraction process:\n\n    ```python\n    def verify_extraction(extracted_data, original_text):\n        verification_prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Here is the original text: {original_text}\n        Here is the extracted data: {extracted_data}\n\n        Analyze the extracted data and verify that ALL availability constraints mentioned in the original text are correctly captured.\n        Provide a JSON response in this format:\n        {{\n          \"is_valid\": true/false,\n          \"missing_constraints\": [ // List of constraints mentioned in original text that are NOT in extracted_data ]\n          \"incorrect_constraints\": [ // List of constraints in extracted_data that are misinterpreted, with explanation ]\n        }}\n        \"\"\"\n        verification_result = call_llm(verification_prompt)\n        return json.loads(verification_result)\n\n    # In main process:\n    extracted_data = extract_info(input_text)\n    verification = verify_extraction(extracted_data, input_text)\n\n    if not verification[\"is_valid\"]:\n        print(\"Extraction error detected!\")\n        # Re-prompt extraction with verification feedback\n        revised_prompt = f\"Re-extract the information, paying close attention to these constraints: {verification['missing_constraints'] + verification['incorrect_constraints']}\"\n        extracted_data = extract_info(revised_prompt) # Try again!\n\n    ```\n\n    This recommendation necessitates exploration.\n4.  **Reasoning Before Decision:** Add an explanation step before arbitrarily picking an answer. Have the system explicitly reason about *why* it's choosing a particular time slot (e.g., \"This slot is chosen because it maximizes the available time for all participants\"). This makes the decision-making process more transparent and easier to debug. This requires exploration to implement new reasoning logic.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the current data, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, the presence of a clear extraction failure that the system *recognizes* suggests that some underlying understanding is present. Implementation of the above recommendations should result in significant improvement.\n\nBy focusing on improving information extraction accuracy and implementing better error handling, the AI system can become far more reliable and effective at scheduling meetings. The exploration of explicit constraint representation is critical to make this more reliable.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe error case output shows an \"Extraction failed\" error and indicates an error in Jose's schedule extraction. There are no explicit `JSONDecodeError` or `TypeError` errors, but the \"Extraction failed\" message hints at a parsing or logical error during information extraction.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system correctly identifies that Mason and Evelyn are free the entire day.\n2.  The system attempts to find the intersection of available times for all participants, demonstrating a general understanding of the problem.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system fails to correctly extract and represent Jose's schedule constraints, specifically regarding the time after which he cannot meet. The prompt makes it obvious and this failure leads to a cascading effect on subsequent reasoning.\n2.  The system seems to arbitrarily choose one of the valid time slots instead of applying a more sophisticated decision-making process, which leads to an incorrect proposed time slot.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Inaccurate extraction of participant schedules and constraints is a critical bottleneck. This leads to incorrect calculations and incorrect candidate time slots.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** The system fails to effectively incorporate all constraints during information extraction itself.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary error pattern is inaccurate information extraction, particularly related to correctly interpreting and representing constraints on availability. This results in incorrect reasoning about available time slots.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the failure to accurately extract and represent constraints on participant schedules during the initial information extraction phase. The \"Jose can not meet on Monday after 15:30\" constraint is explicitly provided and should have been incorporated into Jose's availability from the beginning.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the robustness and accuracy of information extraction, especially regarding constraints. This can be done with more sophisticated prompting and LLM architectures.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** Strengthen the constraint handling mechanism to ensure all constraints are actively considered. This can be done by explicitly representing all constraints and the steps taken to enforce them, instead of just modifying available times.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhance Information Extraction Prompt:** Refine the information extraction prompt to specifically request the extraction of constraints, including those limiting availability windows. Include more diverse examples of constraints in the prompt's few-shot examples.\n2.  **Explicit Constraint Representation:** Introduce an explicit representation of constraints separate from availability. For instance, the system could maintain a list of constraints like `{\"participant\": \"Jose\", \"type\": \"unavailable_after\", \"time\": \"15:30\"}`.\n3.  **Verification Step for Extraction:** Add a verification step immediately after information extraction to check that all stated constraints have been correctly captured. If any constraint is missing, re-prompt the extraction process with specific feedback.\n4.  **Add reasoning before picking the answer:** Instead of arbitrarily choosing one of the time slots, have the system explain the rationale behind choosing the answer. This will help in debugging this specific component of the reasoning, and also improve answer quality.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed\n    *   solution_generation: Partially failed (generated a valid time but not the correct one)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (arbitrarily chose time slot)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the provided information, with a focus on actionable improvements:\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\n*   **Sample 1:** Correctly identifies available slots for Amy and Kevin and proposes a valid meeting time. The reasoning is clear and step-by-step.\n*   **Sample 2:**  Experiences a clear information extraction failure. The \"Extraction failed\" message explicitly indicates the system *knows* it has missed a constraint (\"Jose can not meet on Monday after 15:30\"). Despite knowing the schedule is incorrect, the system proceeds with flawed data, leading to an incorrect final suggestion. This suggests a failure to halt execution and re-attempt extraction when errors are detected. The choice of 12:30-13:00 or 15:00-15:30 is an arbitrary choice that suggests a lack of sophistication in the final decision.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system demonstrates a moderate capability for scheduling meetings when provided with clean, accurate information. However, it is highly susceptible to errors stemming from inaccurate information extraction, particularly related to constraints.  It exhibits limited error handling and recovery. The reasoning component works adequately when the extracted data is correct, but lacks robustness to handle incomplete or inaccurate information.  Final decision-making is simplistic.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Reasoning with Available Times:** The system can successfully reason about the intersection of available times when given accurate input.\n*   **Clear Step-by-Step Reasoning (in Correct Cases):** The system presents its reasoning in a relatively clear, step-by-step manner when extraction is correct, which aids in understanding and debugging.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The error case indicates that the system *can* identify missing constraints during the extraction process.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Information Extraction (Constraints):** The primary weakness is the inaccurate extraction of scheduling constraints. This is a critical failure point.\n*   **Error Handling and Recovery:** The system fails to halt execution and re-attempt extraction when constraint extraction errors are detected, continuing with incorrect information.\n*   **Constraint Enforcement:** There's no explicit mechanism to ensure constraints are enforced throughout the reasoning process.\n*   **Arbitrary Decision-Making:** The system arbitrarily chooses time slots instead of using more sophisticated selection criteria.\n*   **Lack of Sophistication in Decision-Making:** The system lacks a sophisticated approach to choosing the *best* time slot, merely settling for a valid one.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction Accuracy**, with a particular emphasis on robustly extracting and representing constraints on participant availability.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Enhanced Information Extraction Prompt & Examples (Exploitation):** Refine the information extraction prompt to be more specific and include more diverse examples of availability constraints.  The examples should demonstrate how to handle constraints that limit availability windows (e.g., \"not after 3:30 PM\").  Exploit the current extraction logic but enhance it with these better prompts.\n2.  **Explicit Constraint Representation (Exploration):**  Implement an explicit representation of constraints as separate data structures.  For example:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"participants\": {\n        \"Jose\": {\n          \"available\": [\"9:00-17:00\"],\n          \"constraints\": [\n            {\"type\": \"unavailable_after\", \"time\": \"15:30\"}\n          ]\n        }\n        // Other participants\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    This requires exploration to implement a new representation.\n3.  **Verification Loop with Specific Feedback (Exploration):** Implement a verification loop *immediately* after information extraction.

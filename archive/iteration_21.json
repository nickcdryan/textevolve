  "approach_summary": "The script implements a retrieval-augmented generation approach to answer questions using an LLM. It decomposes the problem into information extraction, search query generation, search (simulated with an LLM), answer extraction with confidence scoring, and answer validation. The agent roles are information extractor, search query generator, search engine, answer extraction expert, and answer validator. The main function orchestrates the process, calling `extract_information` to get entities and constraints, `generate_search_query` to create a search query, `call_llm` to simulate search, `extract_answer` to find the answer and confidence, and `validate_answer` to check the correctness of the response, returning the extracted answer if valid, otherwise an error message.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError in the provided error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1. **Effective Information Extraction:** The system accurately extracts key entities and temporal contexts from the questions. This is evident in the \"Extracted Info\" sections of the outputs.\n2. **Constraint Recognition:** The system correctly identifies constraints within the questions, such as \"sole survivor\" or \"21st place skaters\".\n3. **Search Query Generation:** The system generates reasonable search queries based on the extracted information and constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Over-Reliance on Initial Search Results:** The system seems to strongly trust the initial search results, even when they might be inaccurate or incomplete. The \"Validation Result\" incorrectly validates inaccurate information.\n2. **Inability to Resolve Conflicting Information:** The system doesn't seem to have a mechanism to handle conflicting information. In Sample ID 0, the search result states \"there were no survivors,\" but the golden answer indicates a survivor. The system accepts the search result without further investigation.\n3. **Lack of Deeper Reasoning:** The system's reasoning is shallow. It extracts information, forms a search query, and accepts the first answer it finds without critical evaluation.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Inadequate Solution Verification:** The \"Validation Result\" step is flawed, as it often validates incorrect answers directly extracted from search results. The system lacks the ability to critically assess and cross-validate information.\n2. **Insufficient Error Handling and Conflicting Information Resolution:** The system needs a better strategy for handling conflicting information from different sources. It needs to identify potential contradictions and resolve them through further investigation or more sophisticated reasoning.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe primary error pattern is the acceptance of inaccurate information from search results without sufficient validation. This leads to the \"VALID\" tag being applied to incorrect answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **overly trusting nature of the solution verification process**, which leads to the validation of incorrect information extracted from search results. This is coupled with a **lack of critical assessment of the search results**.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Solution Verification:** The solution verification process needs significant improvement. It should not blindly accept the first answer found in the search results.\n2. **Information Reconciliation:** The system needs to be able to identify and reconcile conflicting information from different sources.\n3. **Search Strategy:** The search strategy could be improved to include techniques that promote diverse results and discourage biased or incomplete information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement Cross-Validation:** Modify the solution verification step to cross-validate the extracted answer against multiple independent sources. If discrepancies are found, trigger a more in-depth investigation.\n2. **Enhance Search Query Refinement:** If the initial search results are inconclusive or contradictory, refine the search query to be more specific or to target different sources.\n3. **Implement Confidence Scoring:** Assign confidence scores to information extracted from different sources. Use these scores to weigh the evidence and resolve conflicts. A low confidence score from a single source should trigger further investigation.\n4. **Introduce a \"Fact-Checking\" Module:** Incorporate a fact-checking module that specifically identifies potentially inaccurate or misleading information. This module could leverage external knowledge bases or expert systems.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:** solution_verification, information_reconciliation\n*   **Sample ID 1:** solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:** solution_verification\n",

The system accurately extracts entities and constraints, formulates reasonable search queries, and identifies potential answers. However, it then *blindly trusts* the first promising answer from the search results, marking it as \"VALID\" without proper verification.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The search clearly states \"there were no survivors,\" directly contradicting the golden answer (which presumably indicates a survivor). The system incorrectly validates this false information.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** While the generated response appears correct, the fact it was validated with an accuracy of 0% reveals the same underlying flaw in the verification step.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** Similarly to sample 1, the response is correct. But again, validated with an accuracy of 0%.\n\nThis demonstrates a fundamental flaw in the \"Validation Result\" component, rendering it essentially useless and detrimental to the overall system performance. The system is essentially reporting confidence in incorrect information, masking the underlying issue.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates a **low overall capability** for accurately answering questions. While it possesses strengths in information extraction and query generation, its failure to validate information effectively negates these strengths. The system acts more as a naive information retriever than a reasoning engine.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Accurate identification of entities, constraints, and temporal contexts from input questions.\n*   **Search Query Generation:** Ability to formulate relevant search queries based on extracted information.\n\nThese strengths provide a solid foundation, but are currently overshadowed by critical weaknesses.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Flawed Solution Verification:** The system's validation process is the primary weakness. It lacks the ability to critically assess the accuracy of information retrieved from search results.\n*   **Lack of Cross-Validation:** The system doesn't cross-validate the extracted information with other potential sources of information.\n*   **Insufficient Error Handling:** The system doesn't detect or handle conflicting information effectively. It simply accepts the first seemingly relevant answer.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe **most critical area for improvement is the Solution Verification process**. Improving this process is paramount to increasing the overall accuracy of the system. Without accurate validation, the other strengths are rendered largely irrelevant.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo significantly improve the system, the following changes should be implemented immediately:\n\n1.  **Redesign the Validation Module:**\n    *   **Implement Multi-Source Verification:** The \"Validation Result\" module should be re-engineered to cross-validate potential answers against *multiple* independent sources, not just the initial search result. Aim for at least 2-3 distinct sources.\n    *   **Incorporate Discrepancy Detection:** The module must include logic to detect discrepancies between sources. When discrepancies are found, trigger a \"disagreement resolution\" process (see below).\n\n2.  **Develop a \"Disagreement Resolution\" Process:**\n    *   **Refine Search Query:** When discrepancies are detected, refine the search query to be more specific, targeting sources known for high accuracy or expertise in the specific domain.\n    *   **Implement Confidence Scoring:** Assign confidence scores to each potential answer based on the source's reliability, frequency of the answer across multiple sources, and other relevant factors.\n\n3.  **Introduce a Threshold for Validation:**\n    *   The system should *not* validate any answer unless it meets a predefined confidence threshold based on cross-validation and source reliability.\n    *   Answers below the threshold should trigger further investigation or be marked as \"Uncertain.\"\n\nThese changes should dramatically reduce the false validation of incorrect answers and improve the overall accuracy of the system.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the consistently incorrect validation results and overall 0% accuracy, the **capability trend is currently declining**. The validation process is actively hurting the system by falsely validating inaccurate information. Addressing the issues outlined above is critical to reverse this trend and begin improving system capabilities.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError in the provided error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1. **Effective Information Extraction:** The system accurately extracts key entities and temporal contexts from the questions. This is evident in the \"Extracted Info\" sections of the outputs.\n2. **Constraint Recognition:** The system correctly identifies constraints within the questions, such as \"sole survivor\" or \"21st place skaters\".\n3. **Search Query Generation:** The system generates reasonable search queries based on the extracted information and constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Over-Reliance on Initial Search Results:** The system seems to strongly trust the initial search results, even when they might be inaccurate or incomplete. The \"Validation Result\" incorrectly validates inaccurate information.\n2. **Inability to Resolve Conflicting Information:** The system doesn't seem to have a mechanism to handle conflicting information. In Sample ID 0, the search result states \"there were no survivors,\" but the golden answer indicates a survivor. The system accepts the search result without further investigation.\n3. **Lack of Deeper Reasoning:** The system's reasoning is shallow. It extracts information, forms a search query, and accepts the first answer it finds without critical evaluation.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Inadequate Solution Verification:** The \"Validation Result\" step is flawed, as it often validates incorrect answers directly extracted from search results. The system lacks the ability to critically assess and cross-validate information.\n2. **Insufficient Error Handling and Conflicting Information Resolution:** The system needs a better strategy for handling conflicting information from different sources. It needs to identify potential contradictions and resolve them through further investigation or more sophisticated reasoning.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe primary error pattern is the acceptance of inaccurate information from search results without sufficient validation. This leads to the \"VALID\" tag being applied to incorrect answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **overly trusting nature of the solution verification process**, which leads to the validation of incorrect information extracted from search results. This is coupled with a **lack of critical assessment of the search results**.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Solution Verification:** The solution verification process needs significant improvement. It should not blindly accept the first answer found in the search results.\n2. **Information Reconciliation:** The system needs to be able to identify and reconcile conflicting information from different sources.\n3. **Search Strategy:** The search strategy could be improved to include techniques that promote diverse results and discourage biased or incomplete information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement Cross-Validation:** Modify the solution verification step to cross-validate the extracted answer against multiple independent sources. If discrepancies are found, trigger a more in-depth investigation.\n2. **Enhance Search Query Refinement:** If the initial search results are inconclusive or contradictory, refine the search query to be more specific or to target different sources.\n3. **Implement Confidence Scoring:** Assign confidence scores to information extracted from different sources. Use these scores to weigh the evidence and resolve conflicts. A low confidence score from a single source should trigger further investigation.\n4. **Introduce a \"Fact-Checking\" Module:** Incorporate a fact-checking module that specifically identifies potentially inaccurate or misleading information. This module could leverage external knowledge bases or expert systems.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:** solution_verification, information_reconciliation\n*   **Sample ID 1:** solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:** solution_verification\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using LLM-driven rule extraction, refinement, and application. It employs a chain-of-thought approach, where the problem is decomposed into extracting a transformation rule, refining it, and then applying it to a test input grid. Three LLM agent roles are used: an expert grid transformation expert, an expert grid transformation agent for refinement, and another expert grid transformation agent for applying the rule.\n\nThe core functions are `rule_extraction`, `refine_rule`, and `apply_rule`, which sequentially use the LLM to extract, refine, and apply transformation rules. `call_llm` is used by all three functions to interact with the Gemini LLM. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow: `rule_extraction` extracts a rule from the question, `refine_rule` corrects any errors in the extracted rule, and `apply_rule` transforms the input grid using the refined rule, with regex used to extract the test input grid from the question.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Date:** October 27, 2023\n**System Version:** N/A (Based on provided information)\n**Analyst:** AI System Capability Analyst\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output is a large grid filled mostly with zeros, with a scattering of 5s and 8s. It bears little resemblance to any plausible transformation of a simpler input grid. This indicates a fundamental failure in pattern recognition and application. Furthermore, the presence of \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags but not a code block suggests the system did not generate code for this sample, violating the implicit requirement of code generation.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The output is a grid filled with the value '3'. This is an extremely simplistic and incorrect output, suggesting a complete misunderstanding of the required transformation. The presence of a code block within the \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags means that it did follow directions on output format, but failed to output correct code.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The output contains Python code (correctly enclosed in a code block) that attempts to perform a transformation. However, the transformation logic is flawed. It only checks the third row (index 2) and modifies the fifth row (index 4) based on values in that row. This is overly specific and misses the broader pattern. The final grid presented also seems to be incorrect given the provided code. It appears there is some post-processing confusion.\n*   **General Observations:** All three samples resulted in completely wrong answers (accuracy of 0.00). The system struggles to generate relevant code that generalizes to unseen data, and it is not even following the code correctly. The outputs also demonstrate a lack of self-verification. The model generated code, but does not apply that code to a correct answer or provide any reasoning.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates extremely limited capabilities in solving grid transformation problems. While it can generate Python code and perform basic grid manipulations, its core abilities in pattern recognition, generalization, and solution verification are severely deficient. The system effectively fails at its intended purpose.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation (Potential):** The system can generate *some* Python code, but the generated code is typically flawed. This capability could be a strength if the quality and relevance of the generated code are drastically improved.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Unable to identify and understand patterns from training examples.\n*   **Generalization:** Fails to apply learned patterns to new, unseen inputs.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Lacks any mechanism to verify the correctness of its solutions.\n*   **Instruction Following**: Struggles to follow basic instructions, like output format.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**. Without this, the system cannot perform the core task it is designed for.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Revise Training Data and Methodology:**\n    *   **Data Augmentation:** Significantly increase the diversity of the training data. Generate variations of existing examples by applying slight modifications to the input and output grids.\n    *   **Curriculum Learning:** Start with simpler patterns and gradually introduce more complex transformations as the system improves.\n\n2.  **Refine the Code Generation Strategy:**\n    *   **Abstract Code Generation:** Encourage the system to generate code using variables, loops, and conditional statements instead of hardcoded values. This will promote generalization.\n    *   **Intermediate Representation:** Explore using an intermediate representation (e.g., a symbolic representation of the transformation rules) to facilitate the translation from pattern recognition to code generation.\n\n3.  **Implement a Solution Verification Module:**\n    *   **Scoring Function:** Develop a scoring function that evaluates the transformed output grid based on its similarity to the training examples and its adherence to potential transformation rules (e.g., symmetry, element changes).\n    *   **Iterative Refinement:** Use the scoring function to guide an iterative refinement process, where the system repeatedly generates code and evaluates the resulting output until a satisfactory solution is found.\n\n4. **Integrate Print Statements:**\n    * Include print statements within the generated code for debugging purposes.\n    * Print the intermediate states of the grid at different stages of the transformation to understand where the logic is failing.\n\n5.  **Reinforcement Learning Reward Shaping:**\n    *   Use Reinforcement Learning with reward shaping in order to better follow output instructions.\n    *   Reward outputs that have code blocks inside the \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags.\n    *   Penalize outputs that have any text outside of those tags.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. Without significant improvements in pattern recognition and generalization, there is little prospect of progress.\n",

    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Date:** October 27, 2023\n**System Version:** N/A (Based on provided information)\n**Analyst:** AI System Capability Analyst\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output is a large grid filled mostly with zeros, with a scattering of 5s and 8s. It bears little resemblance to any plausible transformation of a simpler input grid. This indicates a fundamental failure in pattern recognition and application. Furthermore, the presence of \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags but not a code block suggests the system did not generate code for this sample, violating the implicit requirement of code generation.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The output is a grid filled with the value '3'. This is an extremely simplistic and incorrect output, suggesting a complete misunderstanding of the required transformation. The presence of a code block within the \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags means that it did follow directions on output format, but failed to output correct code.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The output contains Python code (correctly enclosed in a code block) that attempts to perform a transformation. However, the transformation logic is flawed. It only checks the third row (index 2) and modifies the fifth row (index 4) based on values in that row. This is overly specific and misses the broader pattern. The final grid presented also seems to be incorrect given the provided code. It appears there is some post-processing confusion.\n*   **General Observations:** All three samples resulted in completely wrong answers (accuracy of 0.00). The system struggles to generate relevant code that generalizes to unseen data, and it is not even following the code correctly. The outputs also demonstrate a lack of self-verification. The model generated code, but does not apply that code to a correct answer or provide any reasoning.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates extremely limited capabilities in solving grid transformation problems. While it can generate Python code and perform basic grid manipulations, its core abilities in pattern recognition, generalization, and solution verification are severely deficient. The system effectively fails at its intended purpose.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation (Potential):** The system can generate *some* Python code, but the generated code is typically flawed. This capability could be a strength if the quality and relevance of the generated code are drastically improved.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Unable to identify and understand patterns from training examples.\n*   **Generalization:** Fails to apply learned patterns to new, unseen inputs.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Lacks any mechanism to verify the correctness of its solutions.\n*   **Instruction Following**: Struggles to follow basic instructions, like output format.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**. Without this, the system cannot perform the core task it is designed for.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Revise Training Data and Methodology:**\n    *   **Data Augmentation:** Significantly increase the diversity of the training data. Generate variations of existing examples by applying slight modifications to the input and output grids.\n    *   **Curriculum Learning:** Start with simpler patterns and gradually introduce more complex transformations as the system improves.\n\n2.  **Refine the Code Generation Strategy:**\n    *   **Abstract Code Generation:** Encourage the system to generate code using variables, loops, and conditional statements instead of hardcoded values. This will promote generalization.\n    *   **Intermediate Representation:** Explore using an intermediate representation (e.g., a symbolic representation of the transformation rules) to facilitate the translation from pattern recognition to code generation.\n\n3.  **Implement a Solution Verification Module:**\n    *   **Scoring Function:** Develop a scoring function that evaluates the transformed output grid based on its similarity to the training examples and its adherence to potential transformation rules (e.g., symmetry, element changes).\n    *   **Iterative Refinement:** Use the scoring function to guide an iterative refinement process, where the system repeatedly generates code and evaluates the resulting output until a satisfactory solution is found.\n\n4. **Integrate Print Statements:**\n    * Include print statements within the generated code for debugging purposes.\n    * Print the intermediate states of the grid at different stages of the transformation to understand where the logic is failing.\n\n5.  **Reinforcement Learning Reward Shaping:**\n    *   Use Reinforcement Learning with reward shaping in order to better follow output instructions.\n    *   Reward outputs that have code blocks inside the \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags.\n    *   Penalize outputs that have any text outside of those tags.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. Without significant improvements in pattern recognition and generalization, there is little prospect of progress.\n"

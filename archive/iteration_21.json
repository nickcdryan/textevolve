  "approach_summary": "This script uses an LLM-driven approach to transform grids by converting them to visual representations and applying analogy reasoning based on training examples. The problem is decomposed into preprocessing the input, converting the grid to a visual, transforming the visual using analogy, and converting the transformed visual back to a grid. The script implicitly uses multiple agent roles as specified in each function that calls the LLM, such as \"expert in converting grids to visual representations\" or \"AI expert in visual transformation and analogy reasoning\".\n\nHere is a brief list of the functions used:\n- `main`: Orchestrates the overall transformation process.\n- `preprocess_question`: Extracts training examples and test input from the input question.\n- `grid_to_visual`: Converts the test input grid into a visual representation using an LLM.\n- `transform_visual_analogy`: Transforms the visual representation based on training examples using an LLM and analogy reasoning.\n- `visual_to_grid`: Converts the transformed visual representation back into a grid using an LLM.\n- `call_llm`: Calls the Gemini LLM with a prompt and system instruction.\n\nThe overall workflow involves extracting the necessary information from the question, transforming the grid into a visual representation, transforming the visual representation using training examples and analogy reasoning with the LLM, and finally converting the transformed visual back into a grid.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nBased on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and capability mapping, here's a thorough capability assessment:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal significant issues:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The output is a near-empty grid populated mostly with zeros, with a small cluster of 1s and 2s in the top left. This bears no resemblance to any plausible transformation from an input grid, indicating a complete failure to learn or apply the intended pattern.\n*   **Sample 1:** The output is a grid filled with repeating sequences of 1s and 2s, with some isolated instances of 3s scattered throughout. Again, there's no clear correlation to the input grids or any discernible logic behind the generated pattern. It appears to be generating repeating patterns without understanding the underlying task.\n*   **Sample 2:** This output is almost entirely filled with the value '1', with some small clusters of '6' and '9'. This shows some attempt to modify the input, but the transformation is completely off, introducing values that aren't consistently linked to the training data.\n\nIn summary, the system hallucinates patterns and struggles to map input values to output values correctly, indicating a severe breakdown in its reasoning process. The output format generation is the only consistently present aspect, but the content is largely nonsensical.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates extremely limited capability in solving the grid transformation task.  It can generate a grid-like structure containing numerical values, but it completely fails to identify and apply the underlying transformation patterns present in the training examples. Its accuracy is effectively zero. The system appears to be randomly generating patterns rather than learning from the provided data.  The primary capabilities (information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation) are all severely deficient.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Format Adherence:** The system consistently generates output in the correct grid format.\n*   **Numerical Awareness:** The system uses numerical values, suggesting an understanding of the data type requirements.\n*   **Attempted Transformation:** The system tries to transform the input, rather than simply returning it, implying an attempt to learn patterns.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The system's inability to generalize learned patterns to the test input is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Value Mapping Accuracy:** The system's value mapping is completely flawed, leading to the introduction of irrelevant values and incorrect transformations.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** The system lacks the ability to understand the context of each grid cell and apply transformations selectively.\n*   **Constraint Adherence:** The system ignores or fails to learn constraints implied by the training examples (e.g., which cells should remain unchanged).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. The system must learn to identify and apply the underlying logic of the grid transformations from the training examples to the test input. Without significant improvement in this area, the system remains essentially non-functional.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a CNN-based Pattern Recognition Module:**  Integrate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically designed to identify spatial patterns in grid data.  Train this CNN on the input/output pairs from the training examples.  This module should output a representation of the learned pattern.\n2.  **Develop a Value Mapping Module with Attention:** Create a module that learns the relationships between input and output values. Use an attention mechanism to allow the module to focus on relevant regions of the input grid when determining the output value for a given cell. The attention mechanism should learn to highlight areas of the grid that influence the value of the current cell. This could be achieved using transformers.\n3.  **Introduce Explicit Constraint Handling:** Define a set of rules based on the training examples. These rules should explicitly specify constraints on the transformations, such as which values should remain unchanged under specific conditions. Example: \"If the surrounding cells are all 0, the center cell remains unchanged.\"\n4.  **Intermediate Reasoning Output:** Add detailed logging and print statements to display the CNN's pattern recognition output, the value mapping module's predictions, and the application of constraints at each cell. This will allow for detailed debugging and analysis of the system's reasoning process.\n5.  **Implement \"Copy Unchanged\" Logic:** Explicitly implement a step where unchanged regions of the input grid are copied directly to the output grid before applying any transformations.  This will help preserve existing correct values and enforce the constraint that some cells should remain untouched.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the 0% accuracy and the analysis of the execution outputs, the capabilities are currently **Declining**. The system's current approach is not effective and likely worsening due to random pattern generation. Immediate and significant changes are required to reverse this trend.\n",

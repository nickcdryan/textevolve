This noise is then resolved through a 'verification' and 'repair' mechanism,\n    mimicking how an LLM might handle ambiguous or incomplete information.\n\n    The key innovation is the introduction of deliberate imperfection in information extraction, followed by a\n    resolution stage, making the system more robust to variations in input phrasing.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    try:\n        # 1.

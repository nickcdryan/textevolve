  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven decomposition approach to solve grid transformation problems. It identifies a transformable subgrid, derives transformation rules for that subgrid, and applies the transformation to generate the output. The `find_transformable_subgrid` function identifies the subgrid, `derive_subgrid_transformation_rule` determines the transformation rule, and `apply_transformation_to_grid` applies the rule to the input grid. The `call_llm` function is used by all functions to interface with the Gemini LLM, while `main` orchestrates the overall workflow.",

Values are misplaced, suggesting faulty indexing or coordinate mapping during the transformation. The output grid is of the correct dimensions, but the internal data is nonsensical.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system *incorrectly* identifies the transformation rule as inapplicable. This suggests a failure in understanding or parsing the input data and/or a problem with its initial decision-making process. The system is basically throwing its hands up and saying its unable to process.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system produces a grid, but the data is wrong. Furthermore, the JSON formatting, while technically valid JSON, has unnecessary newlines and spaces. This demonstrates that the system doesn't understand the format.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a *very limited* capability in solving the grid transformation task. While it attempts to recognize patterns and generate grid outputs, its accuracy is nonexistent. The core weakness lies in its ability to correctly generalize and apply transformation rules. The system has rudimentary pattern recognition and grid manipulation abilities, but lacks the precision and robustness necessary for accurate performance.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Rudimentary Pattern Recognition:** The system attempts to identify patterns, which indicates some level of pattern recognition capability.\n*   **Grid Generation:** The system successfully generates output in the expected grid format, although the content is incorrect.\n*   **Attempt to Apply Transformations:** The system tries to apply transformations, even if the applications are incorrect.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Failure to Generalize Transformation Rules:** The system cannot extrapolate transformation rules from training data to new inputs.\n*   **Flawed Transformation Logic:** The core logic responsible for transforming grids is demonstrably incorrect, leading to misplacement of values.\n*   **Poor Decision-Making:** In at least one case (sample\\_id 1), the system incorrectly concludes that no transformation is applicable.\n*   **JSON Formatting Issues:** Issues with JSON formatting indicate a lack of understanding of structured data requirements.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary improvement focus should be on **enhancing the system's ability to generalize transformation rules**. If the system can't accurately discern and apply the correct rules, all other capabilities are irrelevant.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Detailed Debugging & Logging:** Insert extensive logging throughout the transformation logic. Specifically, log:\n    *   Input data (training examples and test input)\n    *   Intermediate state of the grid at each transformation step\n    *   Values being moved, and their source and destination coordinates\n    *   The transformation rule identified (if any)\n    *   Confidence score of the identified transformation rule\n    These logs should allow you to trace exactly where the system goes wrong and why.\n\n2.  **Develop Targeted Unit Tests:** Create unit tests that focus on specific transformation rules and grid sizes. Start with very simple transformations and gradually increase complexity. Verify the correctness of individual transformation steps (e.g., shifting a row, swapping columns).\n\n3.  **Implement a Rule Application Confidence Score:** When the system identifies a potential transformation rule, assign it a confidence score based on the strength of the pattern match. If the confidence score is below a certain threshold, reject the rule and try alternative approaches or indicate that no suitable rule was found. This directly addresses the problem highlighted in sample\\_id 1.\n\n4.  **Refactor Coordinate Mapping:** The misplacement of values strongly suggests problems with coordinate mapping. Refactor the coordinate mapping logic, ensuring it correctly translates between different grid representations or coordinate systems used during the transformation process. Use unit tests to rigorously validate this logic.\n\n5.  **Standardize JSON Serialization:** Implement a dedicated function or library call for JSON serialization to ensure consistent and correct formatting. Avoid manual string concatenation or formatting.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining.** The system's performance is at 0% accuracy, indicating no improvement or potential regression in its core capabilities. Immediate and focused intervention is required to reverse this trend. The system is demonstrably not learning from its inputs.\n",

  "approach_summary": "This script uses LLM-driven chain-of-thought reasoning and verification to answer questions, first determining if the question is numerical or general. Numerical questions are processed by extracting numbers and performing calculations, while general questions are decomposed into sub-questions, have information extracted for each, and then synthesize an answer. The script defines specialized agents for question type determination, numerical information extraction, calculation, question decomposition, information extraction, and answer synthesis; each leverages examples and a validation step.\n\nThe functions used are:\n- `main()`: Orchestrates the entire process.\n- `determine_question_type()`: Determines question type.\n- `process_numerical_question()`: Processes numerical questions.\n- `extract_numerical_info()`: Extracts numerical data.\n- `calculate_answer()`: Calculates numerical answers.\n- `process_general_question()`: Processes general questions.\n- `decompose_question()`: Decomposes complex questions.\n- `extract_information()`: Extracts information from decomposed questions.\n- `synthesize_answer()`: Synthesizes the final answer.\n- `call_llm()`: Calls the Gemini LLM with a prompt.\n\nThe overall workflow is as follows: `main()` calls `determine_question_type()`, then either `process_numerical_question()` which uses `extract_numerical_info()` and `calculate_answer()`, or `process_general_question()` which uses `decompose_question()`, `extract_information()`, and `synthesize_answer()`, with all *process, extract, calculate, decompose, and synthesize* functions using `call_llm()` to interact with the LLM.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Church of Ireland, at 2.7% of the population, is the second largest Christian denomination. Membership declined throughout the twentieth century, but experienced an increase early in the 21st century, as have other small Christian denominations. Significant Protestant denominations are the Presbyterian Church and Methodist Church. Immigration has contributed to a growth in Hindu and Muslim populations. In percentage terms, Orthodox Christianity and Islam were the fastest growing religions, with increases of 100% and 70% respectively. Ireland's patron saints are Saint Patrick, Saint Bridget and Saint Columba. Saint Patrick is the only one commonly recognised as the patron saint. Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated on 17 March in Ireland and abroad as the Irish national day, with parades and other celebrations. As with other predominantly Catholic European states, Ireland underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late twentieth century. In 1972, the article of the Constitution naming specific religious groups was deleted by the Fifth Amendment in a referendum. Article 44 remains in the Constitution: \"The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.\" The article also establishes freedom of religion, prohibits endowment of any religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner. Religious studies was introduced as an optional Junior Certificate subject in 2001.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Coming off their commanding road win over the Browns, the Cowboys played their Week 2 home opener under the MNF spotlight.  In the last MNF game at Texas Stadium, Dallas would duel with their NFC East foe, the Philadelphia Eagles.  In the first quarter, the Cowboys trailed early as Eagles kicker David Akers got a 34-yard field goal.  Dallas would answer in their first possession with QB Tony Romo completing a 72-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Philadelphia replied with Akers kicking a 44-yard field goal, yet the 'Boys immediately added to their lead with rookie RB Felix Jones returning a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles would take the lead with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 6-yard TD pass to RB Brian Westbrook, along with LB Chris Gocong recovering a Romo fumble in the Cowboys' endzone for a touchdown.  Dallas immediately responded with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again on a 4-yard TD pass. On Philadelphia's next drive, the referees made two suspect decisions. The first was a non-call on a very obvious facemask on Brian Westbrook that would have given the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54.

Membership declined throughout the twentieth century, but experienced an increase early in the 21st century, as have other small Christian denominations. Significant Protestant denominations are the Presbyterian Church and Methodist Church. Immigration has contributed to a growth in Hindu and Muslim populations. In percentage terms, Orthodox Christianity and Islam were the fastest growing religions, with increases of 100% and 70% respectively. Ireland's patron saints are Saint Patrick, Saint Bridget and Saint Columba. Saint Patrick is the only one commonly recognised as the patron saint. Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated on 17 March in Ireland and abroad as the Irish national day, with parades and other celebrations. As with other predominantly Catholic European states, Ireland underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late twentieth century. In 1972, the article of the Constitution naming specific religious groups was deleted by the Fifth Amendment in a referendum. Article 44 remains in the Constitution: \"The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God. It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.\" The article also establishes freedom of religion, prohibits endowment of any religion, prohibits the state from religious discrimination, and requires the state to treat religious and non-religious schools in a non-prejudicial manner. Religious studies was introduced as an optional Junior Certificate subject in 2001. Although many schools are run by religious organisations, a secularist trend is occurring among younger generations.",

Patriots QB Tom Brady was intercepted four times in the defeat, and Colts LB Cato June intercepted two of those passes. Also of note, Colts WR Marvin Harrison had 8 catches in the game for 145 yards and two touchdowns. The victory marked the Colts' second straight versus the Patriots after having lost the previous six. With the win, the Colts became just the second team in NFL history to begin consecutive seasons 8-0 (the Green Bay Packers began three consecutive seasons 8-0 from 1929 to 1931).

In the last MNF game at Texas Stadium, Dallas would duel with their NFC East foe, the Philadelphia Eagles.  In the first quarter, the Cowboys trailed early as Eagles kicker David Akers got a 34-yard field goal.  Dallas would answer in their first possession with QB Tony Romo completing a 72-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Philadelphia replied with Akers kicking a 44-yard field goal, yet the 'Boys immediately added to their lead with rookie RB Felix Jones returning a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles would take the lead with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 6-yard TD pass to RB Brian Westbrook, along with LB Chris Gocong recovering a Romo fumble in the Cowboys' endzone for a touchdown.  Dallas immediately responded with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again on a 4-yard TD pass. On Philadelphia's next drive, the referees made two suspect decisions. The first was a non-call on a very obvious facemask on Brian Westbrook that would have given the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker Nick Folk getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54. In the third quarter, the 'Boys regained the lead with Romo's 17-yard TD pass to RB Marion Barber. In the fourth quarter, the Eagles once again took the lead with Westbrook's 1-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Cowboys rallied with Folk nailing a 47-yard field goal and Barber getting a 1-yard TD run. The Eagles had a chance for a game-winning drive, but Dallas' defense stiffened for the victory, sacking the very elusive McNabb twice. In a game that had 9 lead changes, it also set different point records, including most first half points in MNF history (54) and most combined points in the rivalry's history (78). Also, Terrell Owens (3 receptions for 89 yards and 2 touchdowns) reached 132 career touchdown catches, placing him 2nd on the NFL's all-time touchdown receptions list (behind only Jerry Rice's record of 197).",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error across all error cases is: \"Error in determining question type: Failed to determine the question type successfully.\" This indicates a fundamental failure in the system's ability to categorize and understand the question being asked. The error occurs despite the system passing the \"Question type validation\" check, which suggests a disconnect between the validation logic and the actual question type determination process.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the absence of success cases and the consistent failure in question type determination, it's difficult to definitively identify strengths. However, the following observations can be made:\n\n1.  **Question Validation:** The system has a \"Question type validation\" step that attempts to verify the validity of the question. While this validation is currently ineffective (passing even when the question type determination fails), the existence of this step suggests an awareness of the importance of question understanding.\n2.  **Multiple Attempts:** The system attempts the question type validation multiple times (3 attempts). This shows an attempt to handle potential transient errors or uncertainties.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Question Type Determination:** The core weakness is the inability to accurately determine the question type. This failure cascades through the entire problem-solving process, preventing the system from applying the appropriate reasoning and extraction strategies.\n2.  **Ineffective Validation:** The \"Question type validation\" is currently ineffective. It's passing even when the question type determination fails, indicating a flaw in the validation logic itself.\n3.  **Lack of Fallback Mechanisms:** When question type determination fails, the system doesn't have any fallback mechanisms or alternative strategies. It simply returns an error message.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Question Type Understanding:** The inability to accurately determine the question type is the primary bottleneck. Without this, the system cannot apply the correct logic to extract relevant information and generate a correct answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent \"Error in determining question type\" message across all error cases suggests a systematic failure in the question understanding module. The validation logic always passes, giving a false sense of security before the crucial question type determination step fails, causing downstream processes to terminate prematurely.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the failure of the question type determination module. This module needs to be redesigned or debugged to correctly classify the types of questions being asked (e.g., comparison, extraction, calculation). The validation logic needs to be checked for correctness or adjusted.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Question Understanding:** Improve the accuracy and robustness of the question type determination module. This might involve using more sophisticated NLP techniques, training on a larger and more diverse dataset, or incorporating external knowledge sources.\n2.  **Validation Logic:** Correct the \"Question type validation\" logic to ensure it accurately reflects the success or failure of the question type determination process. The validation should be sensitive to the determined question type.\n3.  **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling mechanisms. When question type determination fails, the system should attempt alternative strategies or provide more informative error messages. Perhaps it could try to classify into broader categories before narrowing it down or simply use keyword extraction based on expected answer types (names, dates, numbers).\n4. Add print statements at various stages of question type analysis to see exactly what information the program is considering.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refactor Question Type Determination:** Re-evaluate the algorithm or model used for question type determination. Consider using a pre-trained language model fine-tuned for question classification. If currently rule-based, transition to a machine-learning approach, or augment the existing rule-based system with a learned component.\n2.  **Debug Validation Logic:** Thoroughly review the \"Question type validation\" code to identify why it's passing even when the question type determination fails. Add logging statements to track the input and output of the validation function.\n3.  **Implement Fallback Strategy:** If question type determination fails, implement a fallback strategy. This could involve attempting to extract keywords from the question and passage to identify potential answer candidates. Or categorize question into broader categories.\n4.  **Dataset Augmentation:** Expand the training dataset with more examples of various question types and negative examples of incorrect classifications.\n5.  **Implement Intermediate Output Logging:** Incorporate logging mechanisms to record the intermediate outputs of the question type determination process. This will allow for more detailed analysis of the reasoning path and identification of specific failure points.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 5:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 6:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 7:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 8:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 9:** information\\_extraction, decision\\_making\n",

This highlights a critical disconnect: the validation logic isn't accurately reflecting the system's ability to understand the question. The outputs reinforce the Error Analysis Report's finding that the validation mechanism is fundamentally flawed. The consistent and repetitive nature of the error across all samples indicates a systematic problem within the core question understanding component, not an intermittent or random glitch.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the AI system demonstrates a severe deficiency in understanding question types, rendering it practically non-functional. While it possesses a *validation* mechanism, this is demonstrably ineffective. The system is unable to progress beyond initial question processing, resulting in a complete failure to extract information or provide answers. The system, as it stands, does not exhibit the capabilities it's mapped to (information extraction, decision-making).\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempted Validation:** The inclusion of a \"Question type validation\" step, even if currently ineffective, indicates a recognition of the importance of question understanding. This provides a framework for improvement.\n*   **Multiple Attempts:** The system attempts question type validation multiple times (3 attempts), showcasing a rudimentary attempt to handle uncertainty.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Fundamental Failure in Question Type Determination:** The inability to accurately determine question type is the system's primary and most critical weakness.\n*   **Ineffective and Misleading Validation Logic:** The \"Question type validation\" module consistently provides a \"Valid\" result even when the question type determination fails, creating a false sense of security and masking the underlying problem. This is actively detrimental as it prevents early identification of errors.\n*   **Lack of Fallback Mechanisms:** Absence of alternative strategies or error handling procedures when question type determination fails results in complete system failure.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Question Understanding**, specifically the accuracy and reliability of the question type determination module. Correctly classifying question types is a fundamental prerequisite for all subsequent processes.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Prioritize Question Type Determination Module Debugging/Redesign:**\n    *   **Immediate Action:** Insert extensive logging within the question type determination module. Log the input question, intermediate processing steps, the criteria used for classification, and the final determined question type. This detailed logging is crucial for identifying *why* the classification is failing.\n    *   **Short-Term Action:** Replace the current question type determination logic with a simpler, more robust rule-based system or a fine-tuned pre-trained question classification model. The goal is to establish a baseline of acceptable performance, even if limited.\n2.  **Address the Flawed Validation Logic:**\n    *   **Immediate Action:** Revamp the \"Question type validation\" module. Instead of a simple \"Valid/Invalid\" output, the validation should assess the *confidence* of the question type determination. The validation logic should consider not just the *presence* of a question type, but also the *reliability* of the determined type.\n    *   **Short-Term Action:** If a reliable validation mechanism cannot be immediately implemented, temporarily *remove* the existing validation step. The false \"Valid\" signals are actively hindering debugging efforts.\n3.  **Implement a Basic Fallback Mechanism:**\n    *   **Short-Term Action:** Introduce a rudimentary fallback. If question type determination fails (or has low confidence based on the improved validation), trigger a keyword-based extraction strategy. For instance, if the question contains \"when,\" attempt to extract a date. This provides a minimal level of functionality even when question type identification fails.\n4.  **Dataset Analysis and Augmentation:**\n    *   **Ongoing Action:** Analyze the current training dataset (if applicable) to identify biases or gaps in coverage. Augment the dataset with more diverse question types, focusing on examples that are currently causing errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capabilities are currently **declining**. The system demonstrably lacks the core functionality it is intended to perform. Until the question type determination issue is resolved and the validation logic is corrected, the system's capabilities will remain severely limited.\n",

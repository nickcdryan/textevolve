  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using analogical reasoning via multiple LLM calls. It decomposes the problem into extracting training examples and the test input, applying analogical reasoning to each training example, and selecting the best output based on similarity. The agent roles are implicitly defined within each function's system instruction (e.g., \"You are an expert at extracting training examples.\"). The function names used and their relationships are: `solve_grid_transformation` (main solver), `extract_training_examples` (extracts training data), `extract_test_input` (extracts test data), `analogical_reasoning` (applies reasoning), `select_best_output` (selects best output), and `call_llm` (for calling the LLM). The workflow is sequential, starting with extraction, followed by reasoning and selection, using the LLM for each step.",

This suggests a disconnect between pattern recognition and action execution.\n*   **Lack of Output Verification:** The system lacks a robust mechanism for verifying whether the generated output grid aligns with the learned transformation. This allows partially-correct or incorrect outputs to be presented.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Incorrect Zeroing of Rows:** A recurring error is the incorrect placement of zeroes in the output grid. The system often zeros out rows that should contain transformed elements or fails to zero out rows that should be empty.\n*   **Misunderstanding of Element Movement:** A frequent error involves misinterpreting how elements are moved between rows and columns. For instance, the system might incorrectly shift elements, duplicate them, or leave them in their original positions.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **unreliable application of learned transformations to the test input**.

It defaults to a \"no pattern found\" state, hindering its ability to provide a solution. The output shows awareness of the lack of training data, but it doesn't attempt to find a solution from the potential outputs in this situation.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system attempts to reason about element positioning but generates an output with an incorrect size.

Although the output has an understandable base (matching positions of number '6'), it lacks verification of the overall transformation.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system correctly identifies the pattern of moving non-zero elements to the last row and zeroing out initial rows. However, it applies the transformation *partially*, failing to move *all* the non-zero elements as indicated by the identified pattern. It also recognizes that the \"closest match\" is not a perfect match, highlighting a problem with its validation system.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system exhibits limited capabilities in solving the ARC tasks.

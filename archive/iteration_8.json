  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-agent system with specialized LLM agents to solve grid transformation tasks through iterative refinement. The problem is decomposed into four main steps: data extraction, rule generation, rule refinement, and transformation application. Each step is handled by a dedicated function (`extract_and_structure_data`, `generate_transformation_rules`, `refine_transformation_rules`, `apply_transformation`) which leverages the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini LLM, using tailored prompts and system instructions to guide the LLM's behavior. The overall workflow involves extracting data from the question, generating transformation rules, refining these rules for accuracy, and then applying the refined rules to transform the input grid, with each step building upon the previous one.",

This could help identify the types of transformations being performed (e.g., shifts, rotations, value changes). The model should use similarity metric feedback as part of its loss function to prioritize rules that maximize similarity between predicted output and gold output.\n2.  **Implement Rule Validation with Error Reporting:** After generating a rule, apply it to all training inputs. If the generated outputs don't match the training outputs, generate an error report indicating which examples failed and the nature of the discrepancy.\n3.  **Focus on Minimal Changes:** Encourage the rule refinement process to prioritize rules that make the *smallest possible* changes to the input grid while still satisfying the training examples. Overly complex rules are more likely to be incorrect.\n4.  **Intermediate Output Logging:** Add print statements or logging mechanisms to show intermediate steps in the rule induction and application process. This will provide better visibility into the system's reasoning and help pinpoint where errors occur. Log the generated rule, the predicted output for each training example, and the comparison to the gold output.\n5. **Explicit Result Construction:** Ensure the system has an explicit step to *construct* the final output grid after the transformation rule has been applied.

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System Performance Analysis\n\nHere's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and my expertise in system capability analysis.\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis. The system consistently fails to generate correct outputs for the given tasks. The issues are multifaceted and stem from a flawed core reasoning and execution pipeline.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system correctly *identifies* that the transformation involves row duplication. However, the *rule itself* is incorrect. Furthermore, the output is a *description* of the rule, not the resulting grid. The \"Edge Cases and Considerations\" section, while displaying some awareness, contributes nothing to correcting the core error.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system returns a JSON grid, demonstrating an attempt to produce the desired format. *However*, the generated grid is completely unrelated to the input data or any potential transformation. This suggests a breakdown in the application of even a potentially flawed rule.\n*   **Sample 2:** Similar to Sample 0, the system describes a transformation (column shifting) but the rule is incorrect. The output is again a *description* of the rule, including extensive validation checks that are ultimately irrelevant because the core rule is wrong.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits a *very low* level of capability in solving the given tasks. It demonstrates an understanding of the *types* of transformations involved (row duplication, column shifting) and shows some awareness of edge cases and input validation. However, its ability to *induce* correct transformation rules, *apply* those rules, and produce the *correct output* is effectively non-existent.  The \"Rule refinement error\" messages highlight that the system is aware of a potential problem but unable to resolve it.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Rule Articulation (Theoretical):** The system can describe transformations in a structured manner, even if incorrect.\n*   **Edge Case Awareness:** The system considers edge cases like empty grids and mixed data types, indicating some understanding of data constraints.\n*   **Structured Reasoning (Attempted):** The step-by-step approach suggests an attempt at structured reasoning, although the reasoning is flawed.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Rule Induction (Critical):** The system *consistently* fails to induce the correct transformation rules from the training examples. This is the root cause of the low performance.\n*   **Abstraction vs. Application:** The system understands the *concept* of grid transformations but fails to translate that into concrete, accurate output.\n*   **Lack of Rule Validation (Critical):** There is no evidence of the system validating its refined rules against the training data before applying them. This allows incorrect rules to propagate and generate incorrect outputs.\n*   **Output Mismatch (Critical):** The system outputs *descriptions* of rules instead of the *resultant grid* in several cases. This indicates a failure to connect the rule induction and application logic with the final output generation.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **correct rule induction**. Without the ability to learn correct transformations from examples, all other efforts are futile.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Revamp the Rule Induction Algorithm:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace or significantly modify the current rule induction algorithm.\n    *   **Details:** Explore different approaches:\n        *   **Similarity-based methods:**  Implement a similarity metric between input and output grids to guide the rule search.  Use this metric within the loss function during training.\n        *   **Constraint-based methods:** Define constraints on the types of transformations allowed (e.g., row operations, column operations, rotations, reflections).  Search for rules that satisfy these constraints.\n        *   **Neural Network Approach:** Consider using a neural network architecture (e.g., a convolutional neural network) to learn the transformations directly from the pixel data.  This would require a large dataset of training examples.\n2.  **Implement Rule Validation with Error Reporting:**\n    *   **Action:**  After generating a rule, apply it to all training inputs and compare the generated outputs to the expected outputs.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   If there are *any* discrepancies, flag the rule as invalid.\n        *   Generate an error report for each failing example, indicating the specific nature of the discrepancy (e.g., \"Predicted row 2 is incorrect\").  Use this report to refine the rule.\n3.  **Enforce Resultant Grid Output:**\n    *   **Action:**  Ensure that the system *always* outputs the transformed grid, and *never* a description of the rule.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   Add a mandatory \"output formatting\" step to the end of the pipeline.\n        *   If the system attempts to output a rule description, raise an error and force it to generate a grid.\n4.  **Intermediate Output Logging:**\n     *   **Action:** Log the intermediate steps to see where the process fails.\n     *   **Details:**\n        *   Log the generated rule.\n        *   Log the predicted output for each training example based on the generated rule.\n        *   Log the similarity of the predicted output compared to the gold output.\n5. **Explicit Result Construction:**\n    *   **Action:** Ensure the system has an explicit step to *construct* the final output grid after the transformation rule has been applied.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   This step should take the intermediate result of the rule application and format it as a 2D array.\n        *   This will help decouple the rule application logic from the output formatting logic, making it easier to debug and improve.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level**. There is no evidence of improvement between the error samples.\n\nBy implementing the recommendations above, you can focus the next iteration on improving the core reasoning capabilities of the AI system, leading to a positive capability trend.\n",

If the generated outputs don't match the training outputs, generate an error report indicating which examples failed and the nature of the discrepancy.\n3.  **Focus on Minimal Changes:** Encourage the rule refinement process to prioritize rules that make the *smallest possible* changes to the input grid while still satisfying the training examples. Overly complex rules are more likely to be incorrect.\n4.  **Intermediate Output Logging:** Add print statements or logging mechanisms to show intermediate steps in the rule induction and application process. This will provide better visibility into the system's reasoning and help pinpoint where errors occur. Log the generated rule, the predicted output for each training example, and the comparison to the gold output.\n5. **Explicit Result Construction:** Ensure the system has an explicit step to *construct* the final output grid after the transformation rule has been applied. This step should take the intermediate result of the rule application and format it as a 2D array.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracted the need for grid transformation), but failed to grasp the specifics of the relationship between input/output.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generated an incorrect row duplication rule).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify the rule against the examples).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (chose the incorrect transformation).\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generated an incorrect grid).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed.\n    *   decision_making: Failed.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generated an incorrect column shifting rule).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed.\n    *   decision_making: Failed.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System Performance Analysis\n\nHere's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and my expertise in system capability analysis.\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis. The system consistently fails to generate correct outputs for the given tasks. The issues are multifaceted and stem from a flawed core reasoning and execution pipeline.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system correctly *identifies* that the transformation involves row duplication. However, the *rule itself* is incorrect. Furthermore, the output is a *description* of the rule, not the resulting grid. The \"Edge Cases and Considerations\" section, while displaying some awareness, contributes nothing to correcting the core error.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system returns a JSON grid, demonstrating an attempt to produce the desired format. *However*, the generated grid is completely unrelated to the input data or any potential transformation. This suggests a breakdown in the application of even a potentially flawed rule.\n*   **Sample 2:** Similar to Sample 0, the system describes a transformation (column shifting) but the rule is incorrect. The output is again a *description* of the rule, including extensive validation checks that are ultimately irrelevant because the core rule is wrong.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits a *very low* level of capability in solving the given tasks. It demonstrates an understanding of the *types* of transformations involved (row duplication, column shifting) and shows some awareness of edge cases and input validation. However, its ability to *induce* correct transformation rules, *apply* those rules, and produce the *correct output* is effectively non-existent.  The \"Rule refinement error\" messages highlight that the system is aware of a potential problem but unable to resolve it.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Rule Articulation (Theoretical):** The system can describe transformations in a structured manner, even if incorrect.\n*   **Edge Case Awareness:** The system considers edge cases like empty grids and mixed data types, indicating some understanding of data constraints.\n*   **Structured Reasoning (Attempted):** The step-by-step approach suggests an attempt at structured reasoning, although the reasoning is flawed.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Rule Induction (Critical):** The system *consistently* fails to induce the correct transformation rules from the training examples. This is the root cause of the low performance.\n*   **Abstraction vs. Application:** The system understands the *concept* of grid transformations but fails to translate that into concrete, accurate output.\n*   **Lack of Rule Validation (Critical):** There is no evidence of the system validating its refined rules against the training data before applying them. This allows incorrect rules to propagate and generate incorrect outputs.\n*   **Output Mismatch (Critical):** The system outputs *descriptions* of rules instead of the *resultant grid* in several cases. This indicates a failure to connect the rule induction and application logic with the final output generation.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **correct rule induction**. Without the ability to learn correct transformations from examples, all other efforts are futile.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Revamp the Rule Induction Algorithm:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace or significantly modify the current rule induction algorithm.\n    *   **Details:** Explore different approaches:\n        *   **Similarity-based methods:**  Implement a similarity metric between input and output grids to guide the rule search.  Use this metric within the loss function during training.\n        *   **Constraint-based methods:** Define constraints on the types of transformations allowed (e.g., row operations, column operations, rotations, reflections).  Search for rules that satisfy these constraints.\n        *   **Neural Network Approach:** Consider using a neural network architecture (e.g., a convolutional neural network) to learn the transformations directly from the pixel data.  This would require a large dataset of training examples.\n2.  **Implement Rule Validation with Error Reporting:**\n    *   **Action:**  After generating a rule, apply it to all training inputs and compare the generated outputs to the expected outputs.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   If there are *any* discrepancies, flag the rule as invalid.\n        *   Generate an error report for each failing example, indicating the specific nature of the discrepancy (e.g., \"Predicted row 2 is incorrect\").  Use this report to refine the rule.\n3.  **Enforce Resultant Grid Output:**\n    *   **Action:**  Ensure that the system *always* outputs the transformed grid, and *never* a description of the rule.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   Add a mandatory \"output formatting\" step to the end of the pipeline.\n        *   If the system attempts to output a rule description, raise an error and force it to generate a grid.\n4.  **Intermediate Output Logging:**\n     *   **Action:** Log the intermediate steps to see where the process fails.\n     *   **Details:**\n        *   Log the generated rule.\n        *   Log the predicted output for each training example based on the generated rule.\n        *   Log the similarity of the predicted output compared to the gold output.\n5. **Explicit Result Construction:**\n    *   **Action:** Ensure the system has an explicit step to *construct* the final output grid after the transformation rule has been applied.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   This step should take the intermediate result of the rule application and format it as a 2D array.\n        *   This will help decouple the rule application logic from the output formatting logic, making it easier to debug and improve.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level**. There is no evidence of improvement between the error samples.\n\nBy implementing the recommendations above, you can focus the next iteration on improving the core reasoning capabilities of the AI system, leading to a positive capability trend.\n"

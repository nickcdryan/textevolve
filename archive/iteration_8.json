  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-agent approach with LLMs to schedule meetings. It decomposes the problem into three steps: extracting constraints, scheduling the meeting, and verifying the schedule, each handled by specialized LLM agents through the functions `extract_constraints`, `schedule_meeting`, and `verify_schedule`. The overall workflow involves extracting constraints from the input question, using these constraints to generate a proposed meeting time, verifying the schedule against the constraints, and iteratively regenerating the schedule if verification fails, until it is valid. The `call_llm` function manages the interaction with the LLM.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and provided guidelines:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample 4:** The system correctly identifies the busy times for Ronald and Ann. The logic in listing available slots seems sound initially. However, it overlooks the fact that 12:30-13:00 would allow for a meeting start at 12:30 AND the required 1-hour meeting duration to end at 13:30 *before* Ronald's 13:00-13:30 meeting and Ann's 13:30-14:30 meeting. Furthermore, the system states the slot must be a *full hour*, which while technically true, suggests a misinterpretation that it cannot start *in* a time slot, and simply needs to *span* the required 1-hour duration.\n*   **Sample 5:** The system attempts a brute-force listing of availability, which is inefficient and prone to errors. The conclusion that the earliest available slot is 16:00-16:30 is almost certainly wrong given the complexity of the schedules. The output doesn't take Billy's preference against meetings after 15:00. This shows the biggest areas for improvement are calculating overlapping free time and preference handling.\n*   **Sample 9:** The system correctly deduces that Monday is not an option due to Deborah's unavailability. On Tuesday, it correctly identifies some constraints. However, it incorrectly concludes that 11:00-11:30 is a possible time slot despite Jason's being busy between 11:30-12:00. It also misses that 13:30-14:00 on Tuesday could be a possibility, as well.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of scheduling constraints and attempts to find feasible meeting times. However, its core capabilities related to constraint handling, especially those involving time intervals and overlapping schedules, are unreliable. It's also weak on incorporating preferences. The reasoning process is relatively transparent, which is a positive aspect for debugging.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Reasoning Transparency:** The system provides a clear step-by-step reasoning process.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The system identifies many, though not all, of the scheduling constraints.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Accurate Time Interval Calculation:** Calculating free time windows accurately when combining multiple schedules and spanning multiple days.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Consistently and correctly applying all constraints (hard and soft).\n*   **Optimal Solution Selection:** Choosing the *best* possible solution based on all criteria, including preferences.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Failing to verify that constraints are not violated by the proposed solution.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Accurate Time Interval Calculation and Constraint Handling:** The single most important area for improvement is the ability to accurately calculate available time slots based on participant schedules and consistently applying *all* constraints, whether they are explicit schedule conflicts or stated preferences. Without this, any further optimization is irrelevant.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Robust Time Interval Logic (Hybrid Approach):**\n    *   **Action:** Create a Python module using libraries like `intervaltree` or custom functions to handle time interval arithmetic (finding intersections, unions, gaps, etc.). This module should be designed to represent schedules and determine available time slots.\n    *   **LLM Integration:** The LLM should *call* this module, providing it with the necessary schedule information. It should not attempt to directly perform the time calculations itself. The LLM should focus on *reasoning* about the results from the module.\n    *   **Example:** The LLM extracts schedules and passes them to `time_interval_module.find_available_slots(schedules, duration)` which returns a list of available time intervals. The LLM *then* reasons about this list in relation to constraints/preferences.\n\n2.  **Structured Constraint Representation:**\n    *   **Action:** Represent constraints using a structured data format (e.g., a list of dictionaries), where each dictionary defines the constraint type, involved entities, and parameters.\n    *   **LLM Integration:** The LLM is responsible for *creating* this structured representation from the input text. Then, during solution generation and verification, *iterate* through this structured list to ensure each constraint is satisfied.\n\n3.  **Multi-Stage Solution Verification:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement a verification loop with at least three stages:\n        *   **Stage 1: Conflict Check:** Verify the proposed time slot doesn't conflict with any hard constraints (existing meetings).\n        *   **Stage 2: Preference Check:** Verify the proposed slot satisfies all preferences.\n        *   **Stage 3: Optimization:** If multiple valid slots exist, choose the one that *best* aligns with preferences. This requires a clear scoring system for preferences.\n    *   **LLM Integration:** The LLM should orchestrate these stages and use its reasoning ability to determine if each check passes.\n\n4.  **Few-Shot Example Refinement:**\n    *   **Action:** Create 3-5 *new* few-shot examples that specifically demonstrate:\n        *   Complex schedule overlaps and how to calculate availability.\n        *   How to consistently apply *all* hard and soft constraints.\n        *   How to *prioritize* solutions based on stated preferences.\n        *   How to resolve conflicting preferences.\n    *   **LLM Integration:** These examples should be included in the main prompt to guide the system's reasoning.\n\n5.  **Implement a \"Solution Critic\" Agent:**\n    *   **Action:** Create a separate LLM agent whose sole purpose is to critique proposed solutions. This agent receives the problem description and the generated solution.\n    *   **LLM Integration:** The critic agent is prompted to explicitly check the solution against all constraints and provide feedback if any constraint is violated or if the solution is suboptimal. The main agent then uses this feedback to refine its solution.\n    *    **Action:** Have the \"Solution Critic\" verify there is enough \"break time\" between meetings.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the capabilities appear to be relatively stable, with a moderate accuracy score. However, the specific errors reveal a lack of robustness in key areas. Without significant improvements, the system's capabilities are unlikely to improve substantially.\n\nBy focusing on these actionable recommendations, particularly the robust time interval logic and the multi-stage verification process, you should see a tangible improvement in the system's scheduling accuracy and constraint handling capabilities.\n",

Then, during solution generation and verification, *iterate* through this structured list to ensure each constraint is satisfied.\n\n3.  **Multi-Stage Solution Verification:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement a verification loop with at least three stages:\n        *   **Stage 1: Conflict Check:** Verify the proposed time slot doesn't conflict with any hard constraints (existing meetings).\n        *   **Stage 2: Preference Check:** Verify the proposed slot satisfies all preferences.\n        *   **Stage 3: Optimization:** If multiple valid slots exist, choose the one that *best* aligns with preferences. This requires a clear scoring system for preferences.\n    *   **LLM Integration:** The LLM should orchestrate these stages and use its reasoning ability to determine if each check passes.\n\n4.  **Few-Shot Example Refinement:**\n    *   **Action:** Create 3-5 *new* few-shot examples that specifically demonstrate:\n        *   Complex schedule overlaps and how to calculate availability.\n        *   How to consistently apply *all* hard and soft constraints.\n        *   How to *prioritize* solutions based on stated preferences.\n        *   How to resolve conflicting preferences.\n    *   **LLM Integration:** These examples should be included in the main prompt to guide the system's reasoning.\n\n5.  **Implement a \"Solution Critic\" Agent:**\n    *   **Action:** Create a separate LLM agent whose sole purpose is to critique proposed solutions. This agent receives the problem description and the generated solution.\n    *   **LLM Integration:** The critic agent is prompted to explicitly check the solution against all constraints and provide feedback if any constraint is violated or if the solution is suboptimal. The main agent then uses this feedback to refine its solution.\n    *    **Action:** Have the \"Solution Critic\" verify there is enough \"break time\" between meetings.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the capabilities appear to be relatively stable, with a moderate accuracy score. However, the specific errors reveal a lack of robustness in key areas. Without significant improvements, the system's capabilities are unlikely to improve substantially.\n\nBy focusing on these actionable recommendations, particularly the robust time interval logic and the multi-stage verification process, you should see a tangible improvement in the system's scheduling accuracy and constraint handling capabilities.\n"

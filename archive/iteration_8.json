  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with multiple LLM calls to solve the meeting scheduling problem. It decomposes the problem into three stages: extracting meeting constraints, finding available time slots, and verifying the proposed solution, with each stage handled by a separate LLM call. The agents involved are an expert meeting scheduler for constraint extraction, a meeting scheduling assistant for finding time slots, and a solution checker for verification, ensuring that the final solution satisfies all constraints.",

The system attempts to solve complex scheduling problems, indicating a general capability to handle multi-constraint reasoning.\n2.  The system outputs a clear error message (\"Could not extract meeting constraints\") when it fails, providing a helpful signal for debugging.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system frequently fails to extract meeting constraints, leading to a complete breakdown in problem-solving. This is evidenced by all 5 error cases.\n2.  The error message \"Could not extract meeting constraints\" is too generic; it doesn't pinpoint the specific reason for the failure (e.g., difficulty parsing date formats, inability to handle multiple participants, etc.).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Meeting Constraint Extraction:** The inability to reliably extract constraints from the text is the single biggest impediment to successful meeting scheduling. Without accurate constraint identification, no solution can be found.\n2.  **Lack of Granularity in Error Reporting**: The error message is a black box. The lack of detailed error messaging prevents the system from diagnosing why the extraction failed.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Constraint Extraction Failure**: The predominant pattern is the inability to extract meeting constraints. All error cases report this issue, regardless of the specific details of the question. This strongly suggests that the constraint extraction module is underperforming across a variety of input scenarios.\n2. **Large Number of Participants:** Example 2 involved many participants (Julie, Marilyn, Olivia, Emily, Bruce, Jeffrey and Kyle). This may indicate a failure mode of scaling to many participants\n3. **Complex Schedules:** The provided schedules have many different overlapping meetings and ranges. This might be a difficulty in correctly parsing the full schedules.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **failure of the constraint extraction module to robustly extract and represent the relevant scheduling constraints** (participants, meeting duration, time preferences, existing schedules) from the input text, particularly when handling multiple participants and complex schedules. The LLM is unable to understand or parse this specific text.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction (IE):** The most critical area for improvement is the robustness and accuracy of information extraction. This includes accurately identifying participants, extracting time constraints (both explicit and implicit), parsing existing schedules, and correctly interpreting preferences. Use an LLM to extract these values.\n2.  **Error Handling & Reporting:** Improve the error handling and reporting mechanism to provide more granular and informative error messages. Instead of \"Could not extract meeting constraints,\" the system should report *which* constraints it failed to extract and *why* (e.g., \"Failed to parse date format,\" \"Could not identify participant 'X' in schedule,\" \"Conflicting constraints detected\").\n3.  **Robustness of schedule extraction.** The current extraction method is failing in more complex schedule layouts.\n4.  **Multi-Participant Handling:** The system might be struggling with scenarios involving a large number of participants.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-driven Constraint Extraction:** Replace or augment the current constraint extraction method (likely regex-based) with an LLM-based approach. Use a chain-of-thought approach. Break down the extraction process into smaller steps:\n    *   *Step 1: Participant Identification:* Use the LLM to explicitly identify all participants mentioned in the text.\n    *   *Step 2: Schedule Extraction:* Extract each participant's schedule, breaking it down into individual busy intervals.\n    *   *Step 3: Constraint Identification:* Identify the explicit and implicit constraints on the meeting time (duration, preferred days/times, etc.).\n    *   *Step 4: Constraint Verification:* Use the LLM to verify that all extracted constraints are consistent and valid.\n2.  **Develop a Specialized Information Extraction Agent:** Create a dedicated \"Information Extraction Agent\" that is specifically trained to extract scheduling constraints from text. Fine-tune the agent on a large dataset of scheduling scenarios, including examples with varying numbers of participants, complex schedules, and different types of constraints.\n3. **Decompose the prompt with reasoning:** Use the decompose_problem_with_llm functionality from the prompt to better understand each component and extract information.\n4.  **Implement LLM-Based Validation of Extracted Constraints:** After extracting the constraints, use another LLM call to validate that they are consistent and make sense. This can catch errors early on.\n5.  **Implement more detailed error reporting:** When constraint extraction fails, use the LLM to generate a detailed error message that explains *why* the extraction failed. For example:\n    ```python\n    def extract_constraints(text):\n        try:\n            # LLM-driven constraint extraction logic here\n            constraints = llm_extract_constraints(text)\n            return constraints\n        except Exception as e:\n            error_message = llm_explain_extraction_failure(text, str(e))\n            raise Exception(error_message)\n    ```\n6. **Multi-agent System:** Create a parser agent and verifier agent. The parser agent will extract the text and the verifier agent will ensure that the extraction is consistent and make sense.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n",

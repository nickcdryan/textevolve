  "approach_summary": "The script solves meeting scheduling problems by using the LLM in a multi-agent system to extract participants and constraints from a question, then find and verify a suitable meeting time; this mimics a chain-of-thought process. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `extract_participants`, `extract_constraints`, `solve_meeting_problem`, and `verify_solution` sequentially. Each of these functions prompts the LLM with a specific system instruction and question to perform its respective task. The LLM acts as a different agent in each call.",

The times proposed (9:00, 13:30, 17:00) are broad and don't demonstrate fine-grained analysis of the participant's schedules.

This will make it easier to compare schedules algorithmically.  Use an LLM to extract the schedules from text into this format. This will make comparisons and application of the constraints much easier.\n\n```python\n# Example of desired schedule format:\n{\n    \"participant1\": [ {\"start\": \"09:00\", \"end\": \"10:00\"}, {\"start\": \"14:00\", \"end\": \"15:00\"} ],\n    \"participant2\": [ {\"start\": \"10:30\", \"end\": \"11:30\"} ]\n}\n```\n\n2.  **Develop Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm (Python Code):**  After schedule extraction, use a deterministic Python algorithm to identify valid meeting times that satisfy all constraints. This algorithm should systematically compare time slots and identify conflicts. This leverages the power of Python's precise mathematical calculations.\n3.  **Implement Solution Verification Agent (LLM):**  Create an LLM-powered agent specifically to *verify* proposed solutions. This agent would receive the proposed meeting time and all participant schedules and would be prompted to confirm that the time satisfies all constraints. Use multi-turn conversation to explicitly check the constraints.\n\n```python\n#Example prompt:\n\"\"\"\nProposed meeting time: Monday at 10:00\nParticipant schedules:\n  - Alice: Busy from 9:00-11:00\n  - Bob: Available all day\n  - Carol: Busy from 10:00-10:30\n\nDoes this time work for everyone?

This will force the system to learn to handle a wider range of scenarios.\n6. **Integrate a 'No Solution' Output:** Implement a mechanism for the system to recognize when no valid meeting time exists and to output a clear \"No Solution Found\" message instead of providing incorrect answers.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but low**.

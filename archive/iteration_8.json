  "approach_summary": "The script implements a multi-stage question answering system using the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The `analyze_question` function identifies the question type and keywords, then `extract_relevant_passage` retrieves relevant information. An initial answer is generated using `generate_answer` which is then validated by the `verify_answer` function. The overall workflow starts with `main`, which orchestrates calls to `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer`, with `call_llm` serving as a centralized method for LLM interactions.",

      "text_report": "Okay, I will provide a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs highlight the following issues:\n\n*   **Range Output (Sample ID 0):** The system provides a range (\"50000-60000\") when likely a more precise number was expected. This confirms the weakness in numerical range interpretation and output precision.\n*   **Successful Extraction and Precision (Sample ID 2):** The system successfully extracted the number \"72\", demonstrating that the numerical interpretation and extraction is possible.\n*   **Successful Extraction and Named Entity Recognition (Sample ID 3):** The system correctly extracted the name \"Darren Sharper\", showcasing its ability to perform entity recognition.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a baseline capability in information extraction, particularly for named entities and simple numerical values. However, its ability to consistently and accurately extract *all* relevant information and handle numerical ranges with the necessary precision is lacking. This inconsistency undermines its overall performance.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction:** Ability to identify and extract named entities (e.g., player names) and simple numerical values.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy (Conditional):** When correct information is extracted, calculations are generally performed correctly.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incomplete Information Extraction:** Failing to extract *all* relevant data needed for reasoning and calculation.\n*   **Numerical Range Misinterpretation/Imprecise Output:** Producing ranges when a specific number is expected.\n*   **Reasoning Gaps:** Struggles with multi-step reasoning and combining multiple pieces of information.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Consistent and Complete Information Extraction** is the single most important capability to focus on improving. Without reliably extracting all relevant information, the reasoning and calculation abilities are severely limited, and the output precision suffers.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement an Information Extraction Pipeline with Error Handling and Contextual Awareness:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Design a multi-stage information extraction pipeline. Start with coarse-grained extraction (identifying potential entities and numbers).  Follow with fine-grained extraction focused on relationships and specific attributes relevant to the question. Implement error handling to gracefully manage incomplete extraction.\n    *   **Rationale:** A pipeline allows for modular improvement and targeted error correction. Contextual awareness helps disambiguate information and identify relevant details.\n    *   **Example:** For Sample ID 7, a first stage could identify all touchdown runs. A second stage would filter these runs by yardage and aggregate the results.\n2.  **Implement Specific Rules for Handling Numerical Ranges:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Add rules to the output formatting module to analyze the question's requirements. If a single numerical answer is expected, implement a strategy for choosing a single number from a range (e.g., take the average or the most likely value based on context). Prioritize specific numbers over ranges.\n    *   **Rationale:** Provides a mechanism for handling imprecise output and improving accuracy.\n    *   **Example:** If the system extracts \"50000-60000\" and a single number is needed, attempt to calculate the average or median value. Consider adding a confidence score to the chosen value, indicating the uncertainty associated with it.\n3.  **Implement a Mechanism for Question Decomposition:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Before attempting to answer the question, decompose it into a series of sub-questions that explicitly identify the required information. Then, use these sub-questions to guide the information extraction process.\n    *   **Rationale:** Decomposing the question forces the system to identify *all* of the necessary information, improving the completeness of extraction.\n    *   **Example:** For a question requiring the total number of touchdown runs of 5 yards or less, decompose it into:\n        *   \"Identify all touchdown runs.\"\n        *   \"For each run, what is the yardage?\"\n        *   \"Filter runs where yardage is 5 or less.\"\n        *   \"Count the remaining runs.\"\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (70% accuracy) and the identified weaknesses, the capability trend is currently **stable but with potential for improvement**.  Addressing the information extraction bottleneck has the highest potential to improve the system's overall performance. Neglecting this aspect will likely result in a stagnant capability trend.\n",

The system must be more robust at identifying *all* relevant pieces of information needed to answer a given question, even when the information is not explicitly stated or requires aggregation.\n*   **Reasoning and Calculation:** Enhance the system's ability to perform multi-step reasoning and calculations based on the extracted information, including identifying instances with same numerical values and generating differences in the numbers.\n*   **Output Precision and Range Handling:** The system should be able to understand when the question requires a specific number versus a range and format its answer accordingly.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Information Extraction Module:**\n    *   Implement more sophisticated techniques for identifying entities, relationships, and attributes within the passage. This may involve using semantic parsing or relation extraction models.\n    *   Implement a system that breaks down complex extraction tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, ensuring that *all* relevant information is considered.\n    *   Add logic to specifically handle numerical ranges, identify the individual numbers and relationships between them.\n2.  **Improved Reasoning Engine:**\n    *   Develop a more robust reasoning engine that can chain together multiple inferences and calculations based on extracted information.\n    *   Implement a constraint satisfaction mechanism to ensure that the generated answers satisfy all constraints mentioned in the passage.\n3.  **Output Formatting and Precision Control:**\n    *   Add a module that analyzes the question to determine the expected output format (e.g., a specific number, a range, a named entity).\n    *   Fine-tune the system to provide precise answers whenever possible and to only provide ranges when the question explicitly asks for them or when uncertainty exists. Add a rule to consider the end-points of ranges as options.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate a precise number instead of range.\n*   **Sample ID 7:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to identify *all* touchdown runs with the same yardage.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated incorrect answer based on incomplete information.\n*   **Sample ID 8:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the relevant percentages for muslim and christian populations.\n    *   decision_making: The system incorrectly decided that it could not answer the question, despite some information being available.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, I will provide a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs highlight the following issues:\n\n*   **Range Output (Sample ID 0):** The system provides a range (\"50000-60000\") when likely a more precise number was expected. This confirms the weakness in numerical range interpretation and output precision.\n*   **Successful Extraction and Precision (Sample ID 2):** The system successfully extracted the number \"72\", demonstrating that the numerical interpretation and extraction is possible.\n*   **Successful Extraction and Named Entity Recognition (Sample ID 3):** The system correctly extracted the name \"Darren Sharper\", showcasing its ability to perform entity recognition.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a baseline capability in information extraction, particularly for named entities and simple numerical values. However, its ability to consistently and accurately extract *all* relevant information and handle numerical ranges with the necessary precision is lacking. This inconsistency undermines its overall performance.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction:** Ability to identify and extract named entities (e.g., player names) and simple numerical values.\n*   **Calculation Accuracy (Conditional):** When correct information is extracted, calculations are generally performed correctly.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incomplete Information Extraction:** Failing to extract *all* relevant data needed for reasoning and calculation.\n*   **Numerical Range Misinterpretation/Imprecise Output:** Producing ranges when a specific number is expected.\n*   **Reasoning Gaps:** Struggles with multi-step reasoning and combining multiple pieces of information.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Consistent and Complete Information Extraction** is the single most important capability to focus on improving. Without reliably extracting all relevant information, the reasoning and calculation abilities are severely limited, and the output precision suffers.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement an Information Extraction Pipeline with Error Handling and Contextual Awareness:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Design a multi-stage information extraction pipeline. Start with coarse-grained extraction (identifying potential entities and numbers).  Follow with fine-grained extraction focused on relationships and specific attributes relevant to the question. Implement error handling to gracefully manage incomplete extraction.\n    *   **Rationale:** A pipeline allows for modular improvement and targeted error correction. Contextual awareness helps disambiguate information and identify relevant details.\n    *   **Example:** For Sample ID 7, a first stage could identify all touchdown runs. A second stage would filter these runs by yardage and aggregate the results.\n2.  **Implement Specific Rules for Handling Numerical Ranges:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Add rules to the output formatting module to analyze the question's requirements. If a single numerical answer is expected, implement a strategy for choosing a single number from a range (e.g., take the average or the most likely value based on context). Prioritize specific numbers over ranges.\n    *   **Rationale:** Provides a mechanism for handling imprecise output and improving accuracy.\n    *   **Example:** If the system extracts \"50000-60000\" and a single number is needed, attempt to calculate the average or median value. Consider adding a confidence score to the chosen value, indicating the uncertainty associated with it.\n3.  **Implement a Mechanism for Question Decomposition:**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Before attempting to answer the question, decompose it into a series of sub-questions that explicitly identify the required information. Then, use these sub-questions to guide the information extraction process.\n    *   **Rationale:** Decomposing the question forces the system to identify *all* of the necessary information, improving the completeness of extraction.\n    *   **Example:** For a question requiring the total number of touchdown runs of 5 yards or less, decompose it into:\n        *   \"Identify all touchdown runs.\"\n        *   \"For each run, what is the yardage?\"\n        *   \"Filter runs where yardage is 5 or less.\"\n        *   \"Count the remaining runs.\"\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (70% accuracy) and the identified weaknesses, the capability trend is currently **stable but with potential for improvement**.  Addressing the information extraction bottleneck has the highest potential to improve the system's overall performance. Neglecting this aspect will likely result in a stagnant capability trend.\n"

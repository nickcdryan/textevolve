It first determines the question type, then extracts relevant information based on that type, and finally generates an answer using the extracted information. Three functions, `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, and `generate_answer`, each act as specialized agents with their own system instructions to classify the question, extract relevant information from a passage, and formulate an answer, respectively. `main` orchestrates the process by calling these functions sequentially, while `call_llm` is used by each of these functions to prompt the LLM and get a response.",

      "original_passage": "Still searching for their first win of the year, the Dolphins returned home for a Week 7 AFC East duel with the undefeated New England Patriots.  In the first quarter, Miami's struggles continued as Patriots QB Tom Brady completed a 30-yard TD pass to WR Dont&#233; Stallworth and a 2-yard TD pass to TE Kyle Brady.  In the second quarter, the Dolphins got their only score of the half with QB Cleo Lemon getting a 4-yard TD run.  Afterwards, New England continued its pounding with CB Willie Andrews returning a kickoff 77 yards for a touchdown, along with Brady and WR Randy Moss hooking up with each other on a 35-yard and a 50-yard TD pass.  The Patriots would end the half with Brady hooking up with WR Wes Welker on a 14-yard TD pass. After a scoreless third quarter, Miami tried to make a comeback in the fourth quarter.  It began with RB Patrick Cobbs getting a 1-yard TD run, along with DE Jason Taylor returning an interception 36 yards for a touchdown.  However, New England made sure that they sealed their victory with Brady hooking up with Welker again on a 16-yard TD pass.  Afterwards, the 'Fins ended the game with RB Jesse Chatman getting a 7-yard TD run. With the loss, not only did the Dolphins fall to 0-7 for the first time in franchise history, but they also lost RB Ronnie Brown for the year, as he tore his ACL in the third quarter while trying to stop an interception return.",

      "original_passage": "Coming off their dominating home win over the Rams, the Jets flew to Gillette Stadium for a Week 11 AFC East rematch with the New England Patriots on Thursday Night Football.  In the first quarter, New York took flight as QB Brett Favre completed a 7-yard TD pass to RB Leon Washington.  The Patriots would respond with kicker Stephen Gostkowski getting a 42-yard field goal.  The Jets would increase their lead as kicker Jay Feely made a 22-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New England would answer with Gostkowski making a 31-yard field goal, yet New York immediately replied as Washington returned the kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown.  Later, the Jets added onto their lead as Favre completed a 15-yard TD pass to WR Jerricho Cotchery to give the Jets a commanding 24-6 lead. The Patriots would get back into the game by closing out the half with a  QB Matt Cassel 19-yard TD pass to WR Jabar Gaffney. In the third quarter, New England hacked away at New York's lead as Cassel completed a 10-yard TD pass to TE Benjamin Watson (along with a 2-point conversion pass to Gaffney) on the final play of the 3rd quarter.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots completely erased the Jets' 18-point lead with Gostkowski kicking a 47-yard field goal.  New York would answer with RB Thomas Jones getting a 1-yard TD run, but New England tied the game with Cassel completing a 16-yard TD pass to WR Randy Moss, who had beaten Ty Law as time expired.  In overtime,  the Jets took the kickoff and marched straight down the field to win on Feely's 34-yard field goal. The drive included some clutch throws by Favre, particularly a connection with Dustin Keller on 3rd-and-17 from deep in the Jets' zone. It was Favre's 42nd game-winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime in his career. Washington was selected as AFC special teams player of the week for the first time in his career. His 92-yard touchdown was the fourth kick return TD of his career, surpassing Justin Miller for the club record.",

      "original_passage": "The rematch of these division rivals was a must-win game for the Giants in a season where every game was quickly becoming a must-win game for the Giants. A win would keep alive the Giants' hopes of winning the NFC East. Dallas receiver Roy Williams scored the game's first touchdown in the second quarter, on a 4-yard pass from Romo. Manning responded with a 21-yard shot to Nicks on the ensuing drive. On the Cowboys' next possession, Umenyiora picked up a Marion Barber fumble, which Jacobs later turned into a 1-yard touchdown run. In the third quarter, Romo found Williams in the end zone again, this time for 5 yards. But on the next play from scrimmage, Jacobs caught a 74-yard touchdown for the longest reception of his career. Another Giant set a personal record in the fourth quarter; Hixon's 79-yard punt return was the longest of his career, and it resulted in his second career return touchdown. In a late rally by the Cowboys, Miles Austin caught a 22-yard touchdown pass from Romo, but the ensuing onside kick resulted in a penalty on Sam Hurd for illegal touching and the Giants ran out the clock. The Giants had swept the Cowboys for the first time since 2004, and were now only one game behind in the division standings.",

This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Precise Information Extraction:** The system struggles to extract only the most relevant information, leading to over-inclusive and noisy answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Question Interpretation & Contextual Understanding:** The single most important capability to improve is the system's ability to accurately understand the user's intent and the context of the question. Without this foundation, other improvements will be less effective.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Question Understanding Module:** Integrate a dedicated module focused on understanding the question's intent. This could involve:\n    *   **Semantic Parsing:** Using semantic parsing techniques to break down the question into its component parts and understand its meaning.\n    *   **Question Type Classification:** Classifying the question into a specific type (e.g., comparison, calculation, fact retrieval) to guide the extraction process.\n    *   **Keyword Analysis with Context:** Improving keyword analysis to differentiate between core keywords and related terms based on context.\n2.  **Refine Information Extraction with Relevance Scoring:**\n    *   Develop a relevance scoring mechanism for extracted information. The score should be based on the information's relationship to the interpreted question intent.\n    *   Implement a threshold for relevance scores, excluding information below the threshold from the final answer.\n3.  **Constraint-Based Filtering:**\n    *   Create a mechanism to identify and apply constraints implied by the question.\n    *   Filter extracted information based on these constraints to ensure only relevant data is included in the response.\n4.  **Training Data Augmentation:**\n    *   Significantly increase the number of training examples, particularly for questions requiring very specific answers and those involving complex calculations.\n    *   Include negative examples (i.e., examples where the system should *not* extract or include certain information) to improve its ability to discriminate between relevant and irrelevant details.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the low accuracy and significant weaknesses, the capability trend is currently **STABLE, BUT UNSATISFACTORY**. Without significant changes focusing on question understanding, the system is unlikely to improve substantially. The actionable recommendations, if implemented, should lead to an **IMPROVING** trend in subsequent iterations.\n"

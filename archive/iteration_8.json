  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by combining LLM-driven information extraction with deterministic Python code for availability checking, using a ReAct-like loop for refinement. It extracts meeting details using `extract_meeting_info`, calculates available time slots with `calculate_available_slots`, proposes a time using `propose_meeting_time`, and verifies it using `verify_proposed_time`. The `call_llm` function is used throughout to interface with the Gemini API, while the main function orchestrates the scheduling process, handling exceptions and calling supporting functions. The overall workflow consists of extracting meeting details, calculating availability, proposing a time, and deterministically verifying the proposed time to schedule the meeting.",

The fact that it's occurring consistently in the verification stage suggests that this stage is particularly prone to code generation errors.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding:** The system seems capable of understanding the problem domain (scheduling meetings) and the general constraints involved.\n2.  **Information Extraction:** The questions are complex and the system seems to be extracting relevant information like participant schedules, duration, and time constraints.\n3. **Clear Error Reporting**: The error reporting consistently identifies that issues are occurring during the verification step.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Solution Verification:** The primary weakness is in the solution verification stage. The consistent \"invalid syntax\" error shows that the generated verification code is frequently flawed.\n2.  **Error Handling:** While the system reports an error, it doesn't provide details or recover from it.

This confirms the initial error analysis and indicates a systemic problem with the verification stage. There is no successful execution to analyze, as all samples fail during verification. This suggests that the core logic of the verification is fundamentally flawed, not just an occasional issue.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capability. While it appears to be able to parse input and extract information, the inability to reliably verify solutions renders it essentially useless for the intended purpose. The verification failure is not just a minor bug; it's a critical flaw that prevents the system from operating correctly.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding & Information Extraction:** Maintain the system's ability to understand scheduling problems and extract relevant information. This is the foundation upon which the rest of the system must be built.\n2.  **Clear Error Reporting**: The explicit error reporting is valuable for debugging.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Solution Verification:** The flawed solution verification process is the most significant weakness.\n2.  **Error Handling in Verification:** The inability to gracefully handle syntax errors during verification execution.\n3. **Code Generation Reliability:** The code generation component is not producing valid Python code, resulting in consistent failure.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Solution Verification**. The entire verification mechanism needs to be redesigned or significantly improved to avoid the \"invalid syntax\" errors. It's the primary bottleneck preventing any progress.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. **Implement Syntax Checking and Correction:**\n   - Before executing the generated Python code in the verification stage, use the `ast` module to check for syntax errors.\n   - If a syntax error is found:\n     - Log the generated code and the error message.\n     - Re-prompt the LLM with the error message and the generated code, asking it to correct the syntax. Give it a maximum of 2 attempts to correct it.\n     - If the syntax cannot be corrected after 2 attempts, skip the code execution and move to a different verification strategy.\n\n2. **Implement LLM-Driven Verification Alternative:**\n   - If the syntax-checked Python code is valid, proceed with execution.\n   - If the Python code fails to validate, use an alternative approach where the LLM directly evaluates the proposed solution against the constraints of the problem *without* generating Python code. Example prompt: *\"Based on the provided schedules and the meeting requirements, is this a valid meeting time? Explain your reasoning.\"*\n\n3. **Enhance Few-Shot Examples for Code Generation:**\n   - Review and enhance the few-shot examples provided to the LLM for generating verification code.\n   - Ensure the examples are clear, concise, and demonstrate correct Python syntax.\n   - Add examples that cover a variety of scheduling scenarios and constraints.\n\n4. **Detailed Error Logging:**\n    - Log the complete generated code and the full error message for every verification attempt. This will aid in debugging and identifying patterns in the code generation errors.\n    - Log the initial question, the proposed solution, and the verification reasoning process for all test samples.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining.** The system's accuracy is at 0%.

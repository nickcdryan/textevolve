  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage extraction approach with LLMs to schedule meetings by extracting participants, duration, days, work hours, and schedules. It decomposes the problem into smaller extraction tasks and a final slot-finding task, using `call_llm` to perform information extraction and validation, and employs an iterative validation loop with a dedicated validator agent in `find_available_slot`. The workflow is extraction of details then finding available slots and returning the proposed time. The functions used are: `call_llm`, `main`, `extract_participants`, `extract_duration`, `extract_days`, `extract_work_hours`, `extract_schedules`, `find_available_slot`.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) directly present in the provided 'output' fields. However, the consistent \"Could not find a suitable meeting time after multiple attempts\" and \"unable to determine a valid day for the meeting\" messages suggest that the core logic within the system is failing. These can be considered *logical runtime errors* where the program executes without crashing but fails to achieve the desired outcome due to flawed logic or inability to handle certain constraints. The phrase \"as those values are returning errors\" suggests some more specific underlying issues are not being surfaced correctly.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Explicit Error Handling:** The system is designed to explicitly state when it cannot find a solution, rather than providing a potentially incorrect one.\n2.  **Constraint Awareness:** The system is *attempting* to consider constraints related to participant availability, meeting duration, and time preferences.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inability to Parse Schedules Effectively:** The system fails to correctly parse and represent the availability schedules of participants, leading to errors in determining suitable meeting times or even valid days. This is indicated by messages such as \"unable to determine a valid day for the meeting\".\n2.  **Overly Restrictive Search Logic:** The system's search algorithm is too restrictive, quickly giving up and reporting that no suitable meeting time could be found. This suggests poor search space exploration and inefficient constraint satisfaction.\n3.  **Poor Error Reporting:** The errors that are surfaced are very generic (\"Could not find a suitable meeting time\"). The system is not correctly bubbling up the detailed root cause issues, like parsing failures or constraint conflicts.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Schedule Parsing and Representation:** The system's inability to accurately parse and represent participant schedules is the most critical bottleneck. This failure cascades into downstream components, preventing effective solution generation and verification.\n2.  **Inefficient Constraint Handling/Search:** Even if the schedules *were* parsed correctly, the system's core constraint satisfaction and search algorithm appears to be too simple and inflexible. It fails even when solutions clearly exist.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **\"No Solution Found\" Despite Existing Solutions:** The most common pattern is the system reporting \"Could not find a suitable meeting time\" or similar errors even when a valid solution exists according to the 'golden_answer'.\n2.  **Difficulty Determining Valid Days:** Several errors indicate the system struggles to determine a valid meeting day, suggesting a problem with parsing or applying date/day constraints.\n3.   **\"Returning Errors\" Messaging:** The presence of messages like \"as those values are returning errors\" implies that the root cause of issues are hidden in the process, not being clearly reported or handled.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the system's **failure to robustly and accurately extract and represent participant schedules and constraints**. This makes all downstream reasoning and problem-solving impossible. The \"returning errors\" messaging suggests underlying parsing or data access errors that are not being surfaced effectively.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Enhance the information extraction component to reliably parse and represent participant schedules and constraints. This may require more sophisticated LLM prompting techniques or a hybrid approach using both LLM-driven extraction and rule-based validation.\n2.  **Solution Generation:** Implement a more robust and intelligent search algorithm to explore potential meeting times, considering all constraints. This could involve techniques like constraint programming or simulated annealing.\n3. **Error Reporting:** Ensure that the system surfaces detailed, useful errors messages when the root cause of an issue is identified.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Information Extraction with Few-Shot Learning:**  Use a more robust few-shot learning approach to guide the LLM in extracting participant schedules and constraints.  Provide 3-5 diverse examples that cover different formatting styles and complexities.  This approach should move away from brittle regex and rely on LLM understanding of natural language.\n2.  **Implement a Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm:** Instead of a simple iterative search, use a more structured constraint satisfaction approach.  Represent the scheduling problem as a set of variables (e.g., meeting start time, day) and constraints (e.g., participant availability, meeting duration). Employ a constraint solver (perhaps implemented using a backtracking search with constraint propagation) to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.\n3.  **Introduce Verification Loop for Schedule Parsing:** After extracting schedule information, implement a verification loop that prompts the LLM to confirm its understanding. The LLM could be asked to summarize each participant's availability, and this summary could then be compared against the original text for consistency. If inconsistencies are found, the extraction process should be retried.\n4. **Implement Multi-Agent Verification:** Employ an additional LLM-driven agent to review the primary agent's extracted information, schedule, and constraints. This secondary agent acts as a critic to identify potential errors before proceeding with solution generation.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample 1:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample 3:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample 4:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's the comprehensive capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the issues identified in the Error Analysis Report.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Consistent Failure to Parse Schedules:** All three sample outputs demonstrate a fundamental failure to correctly interpret the schedule information. This is evident in the messages \"unable to determine participant availability\", \"as those values are returning errors\", and \"unable to determine a valid day for the meeting\". The system is effectively blind to the most crucial piece of information for the scheduling task.\n*   **Generic Default Responses:** When the system fails to parse the schedules, it resorts to generic default responses like \"Any Day, 9:00 - 9:30\". This indicates a lack of fallback reasoning; it doesn't attempt to make any intelligent inferences or ask clarifying questions.\n*   **\"Multiple Attempts\" Claim is Doubtful:**  The \"Could not find a suitable meeting time after multiple attempts\" message is misleading. Given the parsing failures, it's unlikely the system is actually exploring different scheduling options effectively. It seems to be failing early in the process. The core reasoning loop never actually executes.\n*   **Lack of Dynamic Error Handling:** The system doesn't dynamically adapt its responses to the specific parsing error. Instead, it relies on general error messages that don't provide specific feedback.\n*   **Hallucinated Information:** The phrase \"Here is the proposed time\" is misleading because it cannot propose a time due to underlying failures.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system currently has **very limited capability** in scheduling meetings. It fails to perform the most basic task of parsing schedule information and, therefore, cannot generate valid solutions. Its error handling is rudimentary and lacks dynamism. Its sole strength is providing an error message rather than incorrect data.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Explicit Error Handling:**  The system *attempts* to provide an error message when it cannot find a solution, preventing the possibility of returning potentially incorrect results. However, these errors are not granular enough.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Schedule Parsing:** The most critical weakness is the failure to accurately extract and represent participant schedules and constraints.\n*   **Solution Generation:** The system lacks a robust search algorithm to identify feasible meeting times once parsing occurs.\n*   **Error Reporting and Handling:** The system reports generic errors and lacks the ability to adapt its behavior or ask clarifying questions when parsing fails.\n*   **Reasoning:** Given failure of parsing, it cannot reasonably come up with possible options.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **robust and accurate schedule parsing (Information Extraction)**. Without this, the entire system is non-functional.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement Few-Shot Learning with Iterative Refinement and Verification:**\n\n    *   **Few-Shot Examples:** Create 5-10 diverse examples that cover various schedule formats (e.g., \"Mondays and Wednesdays 2-4 PM\", \"Tuesdays except for the first Tuesday of the month\", \"Available all day Friday\"). These examples should include variations in wording, date formats, and levels of complexity.\n    *   **Iterative Refinement:** After the LLM extracts the schedule, implement a verification step where the LLM summarizes its understanding of each participant's availability.\n    *   **Verification Loop:** Compare the LLM's summary with the original schedule text. If there's a discrepancy, re-prompt the LLM with specific feedback (e.g., \"Your summary of John's availability doesn't match the original text. Please try again.\"). Limit the number of retries to prevent infinite loops.\n    *   **Constraint handling:** Provide logic for handling exceptions.\n\n2.  **Implement LLM Driven Constraint Satisfaction:**\n\n    * **LLM Driven Reasoning:** Let the LLM use chain of thought to list constraints and suggest potential options.\n    * **Verification:** Once a potential solution is created, have an additional verification step to verify that constraints are correctly handled.\n\n3.  **Enhance Error Reporting:**\n\n    *   **Granular Error Messages:** Instead of generic messages like \"Could not find a suitable meeting time,\" provide specific details about the parsing failure (e.g., \"Failed to parse the day of the week in schedule text,\" \"Conflicting availability information for participant X.\").\n    *   **Debugging Data:** Include debugging data, like the raw schedule text and the LLM's extracted representation. This will aid in identifying and fixing parsing issues.\n\n4.  **Multi-Agent Verification Implementation:**\n\n    * Employ an additional LLM-driven agent to review the primary agent's extracted information, schedule, and constraints. This secondary agent acts as a critic to identify potential errors before proceeding with solution generation.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level.** The system consistently fails to parse schedules and, therefore, cannot perform its core function. Without significant improvements in schedule parsing, there is no upward trend. It may even be argued to be declining, as the system's hallucination may degrade trust.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting structured data using `extract_structured_data`, which uses an LLM to parse the input question into a JSON format, including participants, duration, and constraints, using few-shot examples. Then, `propose_and_validate_solution` attempts to generate a valid meeting time, using an LLM to propose a time and another LLM as a verifier to ensure it meets all constraints; this process repeats up to `max_attempts`. The overall workflow is `main` calls `extract_structured_data` and then `propose_and_validate_solution`; the `propose_and_validate_solution` in turn calls `call_llm` twice and `extract_structured_data` calls `call_llm` once; `call_llm` is the interface to the LLM. The system employs agent roles as an data extraction agent, meeting scheduler, and a verifier and uses a verification loop pattern to refine the solution.",

This error indicates a `JSONDecodeError`, which means the system is trying to parse a JSON string, but it's receiving either an empty string or a string that doesn't start with a valid JSON structure (e.g., doesn't begin with '{' or '[').\n\n## STRENGTHS\nBased on the problem description, the system *attempts* to incorporate several strengths:\n1. **Expert System Design:** Aims to mimic the reasoning process of a meeting scheduling expert.\n2. **Constraint-Awareness:** Tries to incorporate schedule constraints and preferences.\n3. **Problem Decomposition:** The system *attempts* to break down the scheduling problem.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **JSON Parsing Failures:** The system consistently fails to parse JSON, likely due to improper formatting or incomplete responses from the LLM.\n2. **Error Handling:** The system's error handling is rudimentary. A `JSONDecodeError` consistently halts execution instead of gracefully recovering or providing a meaningful alternative solution.\n3. **Lack of Robustness:** The system appears brittle and prone to failure with even minor variations in the input.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **LLM Output Reliability:** The LLM is likely producing inconsistent or malformed JSON output, which the parsing component cannot handle. This is the PRIMARY source of failure.\n2. **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system lacks proper input validation to ensure the LLM's response conforms to the expected JSON format BEFORE attempting to parse it.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe error pattern is consistent:\n1. The system receives a scheduling task.\n2. The LLM generates a response (presumably in JSON format).\n3. The Python code attempts to parse the LLM response as JSON.\n4. The parsing fails with `JSONDecodeError` due to malformed JSON or an empty string.\n5. The system halts execution.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe single most critical problem is the **unreliable JSON output from the LLM**. The system is not robust to variations in the LLM's response format and lacks proper input validation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **LLM Output Formatting:** Improve prompts to ensure the LLM consistently generates valid JSON, or use a more robust output format.\n2. **JSON Parsing Robustness:** Implement error handling to catch `JSONDecodeError` exceptions, and implement retry logic, or fallback mechanisms.\n3. **Input Validation:** Validate the LLM's response *before* attempting to parse it as JSON. Check if the response is empty or contains basic JSON structure.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Prompt Engineering:** Modify the LLM prompt to explicitly request a specific JSON structure and provide examples. Emphasize the importance of valid JSON output. Add instructions for the LLM to explicitly state when it is unable to provide a solution, returning a predefined JSON response like `{\"solution\": \"Unable to find a valid time\"}` instead of an empty or malformed JSON string.\n\n2. **Robust JSON Parsing with Fallback:**\n   ```python\n   import json\n\n   def parse_json(json_string):\n       try:\n           return json.loads(json_string)\n       except json.JSONDecodeError:\n           print(\"JSONDecodeError occurred.

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe runtime error \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" consistently appears across all execution samples. This definitively indicates that the Python `json.loads()` function is receiving an empty string or a non-JSON formatted string. The LLM is failing to produce valid JSON output in almost all cases. There's no variation in the error pattern, suggesting the issue is systemic and not specific to certain inputs. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` markers suggest that the system is correctly capturing the LLM's output, so the problem lies squarely with the *content* of that output.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe current system demonstrates extremely limited capability. While it attempts to implement a sophisticated scheduling system with constraint-awareness and problem decomposition, its fundamental inability to reliably parse JSON output renders these higher-level goals unattainable. The system is essentially non-functional in its current state. Its *potential* capabilities are masked by the consistent failure to handle LLM outputs.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\nThe attempted expert system design and constraint-awareness *could* be strengths if the system were functioning correctly. However, in its current state, there are no demonstrable strengths. The focus should be on establishing a functional baseline before optimizing for advanced features.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Unreliable JSON Output Handling:** The system's inability to parse LLM output due to malformed or empty JSON strings is the paramount weakness. This completely blocks the system's intended functionality.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The system crashes instead of gracefully recovering from JSON parsing errors. This makes the system extremely brittle.\n3.  **LLM Prompting Issues**: The prompts are not structured effectively to guarantee valid JSON responses.\n4. **Missing Input Validation**: There is no attempt to validate LLM output before attempting to parse it as JSON.\n5. **Limited Recovery Mechanisms**: The system fails to employ any mechanisms for recovering or retrying from errors.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **robust JSON parsing and handling of LLM outputs**. The system *must* be able to reliably process the information provided by the LLM, even when that information is imperfect. All other improvements are contingent on resolving this core issue.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Comprehensive Prompt Revision:** Redesign the LLM prompt to *force* a JSON response. Include multiple examples of the *exact* JSON structure you expect. Add specific instructions like: \"If you cannot find a valid schedule, return `{\"solution\": \"Unable to find a valid time\"}`. *Always* return valid JSON.\" Increase the prompting strength and reduce the LLM temperature to encourage more predictable outputs. Use few-shot examples that are extremely precise and detailed.\n2.  **Multi-Tiered JSON Parsing with Aggressive Recovery:** Implement a function like the `parse_json` example provided in the previous response. Augment this function with additional recovery steps:\n    *   If the initial `json.loads()` fails, attempt to strip any leading/trailing non-JSON text from the LLM output and retry.\n    *   Implement a simple state machine that attempts to find the start and end braces `{}` or brackets `[]`, and then attempts to parse the substring.\n    *   If all recovery attempts fail, return a *predefined* default JSON structure indicating failure, such as `{\"solution\": \"Error parsing LLM output\"}`.\n3.  **Pre-Parsing Input Validation:** *Before* attempting `json.loads()`, check:\n    *   Is the LLM output empty? If so, return the default failure JSON.\n    *   Does the output *start* with a `{` or `[`? If not, attempt to prepend a `{` or `[` to the beginning and append a `}` or `]` to the end and retry parsing. Log these attempts.\n4.  **Implement Retry Logic with Error Backoff**: Wrap the entire LLM call and JSON parsing process in a `try...except` block. If an error occurs (including `JSONDecodeError`), retry the call up to 3 times, with a short delay (e.g., 1 second) between retries. Add an increasing backoff for retries (e.g., 1s, then 2s, then 4s). Log all retry attempts.\n5.  **Monitor LLM Output Quality**: Log the *raw* LLM output for a sample of requests. This will allow you to continuously monitor the quality of the LLM's JSON generation and identify potential prompt drift.\n6. **Input Sanitization:** Add code to sanitize the LLM output string. Convert all single quotes to double quotes (as JSON requires), and escape any special characters that might interfere with parsing.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **stable at a very low level**. The system consistently fails due to JSON parsing errors. Until the actionable recommendations are implemented and the core JSON handling issue is resolved, there will be no improvement in capability. Without functional parsing, the system can't progress.\n",

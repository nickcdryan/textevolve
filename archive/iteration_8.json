  "approach_summary": "The script addresses grid transformation problems using a multi-step LLM-driven approach, incorporating rule extraction, verification, and application. It decomposes the problem into extracting transformation rules from input-output grid examples, verifying the extracted rules, and then applying the verified rule to generate the final output grid. Three agent roles are used: rule extraction expert, rule verification expert, and rule application expert. The function `call_llm` makes calls to the Gemini API with specific prompts and system instructions to fulfill each of these roles. The `analyze_grid_transformation` function orchestrates calls to `call_llm` with prompts for rule extraction, verification, and application, while `main` serves as the entry point, calling `analyze_grid_transformation` and returning the result.",

No, the extracted rule is incorrect.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe extracted rule attempts to generalize a pattern of mirroring adjacent rows and zeroing out the rest. However, the critical flaw lies in the ambiguity of which \"adjacent rows containing non-zero elements\" to select.\n\n*   In **Example 1**, it chooses the top two rows.\n*   In **Example 2**, it chooses rows 5 and 6.\n*   In **Example 3**, it chooses rows 1 and 2.\n\nThere's no consistent, logical criterion for *selecting* which adjacent rows to mirror. The rule doesn't provide any guidance on how to decide which pair of rows to use when multiple possibilities exist or why specific rows are chosen in each example.\n\nSince the rule lacks a deterministic method for selecting the rows to mirror, it's not a valid generalization of the transformation applied in the training examples. It's simply an observation of *one possible* action that *could* be taken, but without specifying *when* and *why*. Thus, applying it to new inputs will lead to inconsistent and unpredictable results. Furthermore, based on the rule, after mirroring the two chosen rows, we must set the other rows to be zero-filled.\n\nANSWER_END\n",

These models may be able to capture more complex relationships and generalize better than the current algorithm.\n    *   **Introduce Attention Mechanisms:** If using a neural network approach, incorporate attention mechanisms to allow the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input grids when extracting rules.\n2.  **Develop a Rule Validation Module (Improved Version):**\n    *   **Implement Robust Testing:** Create a module that explicitly validates the extracted rule against all training examples before applying it to the test input. This module should identify any inconsistencies or errors in the rule and provide feedback to the rule extraction algorithm.\n    *   **Implement Backtracking:** If the rule fails validation, implement a mechanism to backtrack and explore alternative rules.\n3.  **Enhance Output Generation Module:**\n    *   **Dedicated Output Generation:** Create a dedicated module for generating the output grid based on the extracted rule.\n    *   **Explicit Grid Checks:** Include explicit checks within the output generation module to ensure it produces a valid grid (e.g., correct dimensions, data types).\n4.  **Improve Debugging:**\n    *   **Extensive Print Statements:** Add print statements at key steps in the process (e.g., after rule extraction, before applying the rule to the test input, during output grid generation) to help debug the system and identify the source of errors. Print the exact state of all variables.\n    *   **Visualization Tools:** Consider creating visualization tools to help understand the system's internal state and the transformations it is performing.\n5.  **Increase the Training Dataset for Rule Validation Module:** Feed the rule validation module more data to improve its classification accuracy.\n6.  **Implement Edge Case Handling:** Add capabilities to handle edge cases.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0/3 accuracy), the system's capabilities are **stable at a low level.** Significant improvements are needed to demonstrate any positive trend. With the current action items, there is potential for improvements, but it is necessary to test and assess the effect of these changes.\n"

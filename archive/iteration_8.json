  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to answer questions by decomposing them into sub-questions, extracting information for each with confidence scores, synthesizing a final answer, and validating it. The problem is decomposed into question decomposition, information extraction with confidence scoring, answer synthesis, and validation. The script uses LLMs with different system instructions to emulate different expert agent roles for question decomposition, concise answer extraction, information synthesis, and answer validation.\n\nThe functions used are `call_llm` for interacting with the Gemini LLM and `main` which drives the overall workflow of question decomposition, information extraction, answer synthesis, and validation. `call_llm` is used by `main` with different prompts and system instructions to perform all LLM-related tasks.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and sample executions.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**SYSTEM NAME:** (Please insert system name here)\n**VERSION:** (Please insert version number here)\n**DATE:** October 26, 2023\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal significant shortcomings in the system's ability to accurately extract and reason with information.  Specifically:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system incorrectly identifies Robert V. Demicco as the recipient of the William Henry Twenhofel Medal in 1978. This suggests a failure in either information retrieval from the source document (the correct recipient should have been identified) or a lookup against an external knowledge base.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system incorrectly identifies Rajiv Gandhi as the Prime Minister during Pitroda's appointment and acknowledges that the answer seems wrong which indicates that the system is aware of an issue but cannot correct it. The system also fails to extract the appointment date, which should be a basic function. The system also failed to extract rank.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system indicates that Otto Schluter started and ended his professorship in the same year, highlighting a complete lack of temporal reasoning. The contradictory start and end dates went undetected, revealing a flaw in consistency checking.\n\nThe repeated failure across all samples, resulting in 0% accuracy, is indicative of a widespread issue, not isolated incidents.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates very limited capabilities in its current state. While it can generate sub-questions and attempt to assign confidence scores, the core capabilities of accurate information extraction, fact verification, and temporal reasoning are severely deficient. The system consistently fails to provide correct answers due to errors in these fundamental areas.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Sub-question Generation:** The system's ability to break down complex questions into smaller, more manageable sub-questions is a valuable asset. This should be preserved and refined.\n*   **Confidence Scoring (Potential):** While the confidence scores don't currently correlate well with accuracy, the inclusion of a confidence scoring mechanism is beneficial. This mechanism should be improved to provide more reliable estimates of the answer's correctness.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction:**  The system struggles to retrieve the correct information from the source data. This is a fundamental flaw that undermines all other capabilities.\n*   **Fact Verification:** The system lacks a robust mechanism to verify the accuracy of extracted information against external knowledge or the source document itself.\n*   **Temporal Reasoning:** The system is unable to accurately extract and reason with temporal data (dates, durations, etc.). This leads to incorrect answers for questions involving time periods.\n*   **Contextual Consistency:** The system does not adequately ensure that extracted information is consistent within the context of the given question and other extracted facts.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate information extraction**. If the system cannot reliably extract the correct information from the source data, all other capabilities are rendered useless.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Fact Verification Module (Priority):** Integrate a fact verification module into the information extraction pipeline. This module should cross-reference extracted information against external knowledge sources (e.g., a knowledge graph, Wikidata, reliable APIs). Focus on verifiable entities, relations, and attributes. For Sample 0, this could include a lookup of \"William Henry Twenhofel Medal\" recipients by year.\n\n2.  **Enhance Temporal Reasoning:**  Implement a temporal reasoning module using libraries like `dateutil` (Python) or similar tools. This will allow the system to parse dates, calculate durations, and perform comparisons. For Sample 2, the system should be able to determine that 1911-1911 represents a duration of 0 years, indicating a problem. This should trigger a re-evaluation and error.\n\n3.  **Improve Information Extraction with Focused Training:** Fine-tune the information extraction model with a dataset that emphasizes accuracy and includes negative examples (cases where the correct answer should *not* be extracted). Pay close attention to training the model to extract date information correctly, using a specific format.\n\n4.  **Implement Consistency Checks:** Introduce rules to check for contradictions in extracted information. For example:\n    *   If a start date and end date are identical, flag the answer as potentially incorrect.\n    *   If information extracted from different sentences contradicts each other, trigger a re-evaluation.\n\n5.  **Refine Confidence Scoring:**  Tie the confidence score to the output of the fact verification module. High confidence should only be assigned if the extracted information is consistent with external knowledge and internal consistency checks.  Consider lowering confidence if the information has been looked up but cannot be validated.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **declining**. The 0% accuracy rate indicates a significant problem. Immediate action is required to address the core weaknesses and prevent further degradation. Focusing on the recommendations above, especially the fact verification module, can help to revert this trend.\n",

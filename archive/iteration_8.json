  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-Guided Iterative Context Expansion & Focused Summarization (LLM-ICE-FS) to answer questions. It decomposes the problem into entity extraction, iterative context expansion, focused summarization, and answer verification. The agent roles include an entity extractor, information gatherer, summarizer, and validator, all implemented via prompting the LLM with specific system instructions.\n\nKey functions include: `extract_key_entities` (extracts entities from the question), `expand_context` (gathers information about entities), `summarize_context` (summarizes the context to answer the question), and `verify_answer` (verifies the answer). The overall workflow involves first extracting entities, then iteratively expanding the context around those entities, summarizing the context to generate an answer, and finally verifying the answer for accuracy.",

(All cases show this)\n3. **Verification step:** The system attempts to verify the answer against the context. (All cases show this)\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Inability to identify correct information within source material:** Even though the system knows to look for information on Myrtle Eagan's parents in the show \"Severance\", it incorrectly concludes that the information is not available.\n2. **Incorrect Validation:** The system validates an incorrect answer, indicating an issue with the validation logic or the information available to the validation step. The validation states that the show doesn't reveal the parents, when in fact the golden answer shows they are.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Depth of Knowledge Graph:** The system's knowledge graph or search mechanism appears limited in its ability to retrieve specific, less obvious information, even if it exists in the source material. It is too quick to assert that the information is \"not revealed.\"\n2. **Verification Logic Flaws:** The validation step fails to correctly assess the provided answer against the available evidence. It appears to confirm a negative assertion (\"not revealed\") too easily.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Premature Negative Assertion:** The system tends to conclude that information is not available even when it might be present but not easily found or explicitly stated.\n2. **Validation of Incorrect Negatives:** The \"VALID\" status is assigned even when the answer contradicts the golden answer, especially when the answer is a negative statement.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's premature conclusion that information is unavailable coupled with a flawed validation process that confirms this incorrect conclusion. This leads to the system failing to find and provide correct answers that require more in-depth search or inference.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Knowledge Retrieval:** Enhance the system's ability to find more nuanced or less directly stated information. This may involve improving search algorithms, expanding the knowledge graph, or implementing more sophisticated reasoning techniques.\n2. **Validation Logic:** Revise the validation logic to be more skeptical of negative assertions and to require stronger evidence before confirming that information is unavailable. It needs to be able to cross-reference with other sources or known facts more effectively.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a multi-stage search strategy:** Instead of a single search, try multiple searches with increasingly specific keywords and filters.\n2. **Improve Knowledge Graph Coverage:** Expand the knowledge graph with more detailed information about relationships between entities.\n3. **Refine Validation Criteria:** Make the validation step more rigorous, particularly when dealing with negative assertions. Consider adding a \"uncertain\" or \"needs more information\" state instead of immediately validating a negative. Use the validation stage to actively seek contradicting evidence.\n4. **Implement reasoning capabilities:** Use the context to derive information that is not explicitly stated in the source material.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Success (Identifies entities but fails to find specific information about parents)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (Generates an incorrect answer stating information is unavailable)\n    *   solution_verification: Failure (Incorrectly validates the incorrect answer)\n",

The validation step correctly confirms these answers.\n*   **Failure Case (Sample ID 2):**\n    *   The system correctly identifies the entities \"Myrtle Eagan\" and \"Severance.\"\n    *   It retrieves relevant context that contains the *incorrect* assertion that the parents are not revealed.\n    *   Critically, the system *validates* this incorrect assertion. This highlights a significant flaw in the verification logic.\n    *   The system is too quick to conclude that information is unavailable.\n    *   The system exhibits a strong bias towards trusting the initial context retrieved, even if that context is incorrect.\n\n**Patterns:**\n\n*   The system performs well when information is readily available and explicitly stated.\n*   The system struggles with negative queries or when the answer requires deeper reasoning or searching beyond the initially retrieved context.\n*   The validation step is unreliable, especially when dealing with negative assertions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic information retrieval and question answering capabilities. It can extract entities and retrieve context effectively. However, its ability to handle complex queries, perform nuanced searches, and validate information accurately is severely limited.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNone identified in the provided data.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1. **Effective Information Extraction:** The system successfully identifies key entities from the question, such as \"Myrtle Eagan\" and \"Severance.\" (Success case 0 and 1 also show this)\n2. **Context Retrieval:** The system attempts to retrieve relevant context related to the identified entities. (All cases show this)\n3. **Verification step:** The system attempts to verify the answer against the context. (All cases show this)\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Inability to identify correct information within source material:** Even though the system knows to look for information on Myrtle Eagan's parents in the show \"Severance\", it incorrectly concludes that the information is not available.\n2. **Incorrect Validation:** The system validates an incorrect answer, indicating an issue with the validation logic or the information available to the validation step. The validation states that the show doesn't reveal the parents, when in fact the golden answer shows they are.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Depth of Knowledge Graph:** The system's knowledge graph or search mechanism appears limited in its ability to retrieve specific, less obvious information, even if it exists in the source material. It is too quick to assert that the information is \"not revealed.\"\n2. **Verification Logic Flaws:** The validation step fails to correctly assess the provided answer against the available evidence. It appears to confirm a negative assertion (\"not revealed\") too easily.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Premature Negative Assertion:** The system tends to conclude that information is not available even when it might be present but not easily found or explicitly stated.\n2. **Validation of Incorrect Negatives:** The \"VALID\" status is assigned even when the answer contradicts the golden answer, especially when the answer is a negative statement.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's premature conclusion that information is unavailable coupled with a flawed validation process that confirms this incorrect conclusion. This leads to the system failing to find and provide correct answers that require more in-depth search or inference.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Knowledge Retrieval:** Enhance the system's ability to find more nuanced or less directly stated information. This may involve improving search algorithms, expanding the knowledge graph, or implementing more sophisticated reasoning techniques.\n2. **Validation Logic:** Revise the validation logic to be more skeptical of negative assertions and to require stronger evidence before confirming that information is unavailable. It needs to be able to cross-reference with other sources or known facts more effectively.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a multi-stage search strategy:** Instead of a single search, try multiple searches with increasingly specific keywords and filters.\n2. **Improve Knowledge Graph Coverage:** Expand the knowledge graph with more detailed information about relationships between entities.\n3. **Refine Validation Criteria:** Make the validation step more rigorous, particularly when dealing with negative assertions. Consider adding a \"uncertain\" or \"needs more information\" state instead of immediately validating a negative. Use the validation stage to actively seek contradicting evidence.\n4. **Implement reasoning capabilities:** Use the context to derive information that is not explicitly stated in the source material.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Success (Identifies entities but fails to find specific information about parents)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (Generates an incorrect answer stating information is unavailable)\n    *   solution_verification: Failure (Incorrectly validates the incorrect answer)\n",

The validation step correctly confirms these answers.\n*   **Failure Case (Sample ID 2):**\n    *   The system correctly identifies the entities \"Myrtle Eagan\" and \"Severance.\"\n    *   It retrieves relevant context that contains the *incorrect* assertion that the parents are not revealed.\n    *   Critically, the system *validates* this incorrect assertion. This highlights a significant flaw in the verification logic.\n    *   The system is too quick to conclude that information is unavailable.\n    *   The system exhibits a strong bias towards trusting the initial context retrieved, even if that context is incorrect.\n\n**Patterns:**\n\n*   The system performs well when information is readily available and explicitly stated.\n*   The system struggles with negative queries or when the answer requires deeper reasoning or searching beyond the initially retrieved context.\n*   The validation step is unreliable, especially when dealing with negative assertions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic information retrieval and question answering capabilities. It can extract entities and retrieve context effectively. However, its ability to handle complex queries, perform nuanced searches, and validate information accurately is severely limited.

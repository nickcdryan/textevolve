This agent should specifically check if any constraints or preferences are violated by the selected time slot. Use LLM-based reasoning to check if the chosen time conflicts with any of the participant's schedules or preferences",
        "4. Re-design the output format to be more informative. Instead of just providing the proposed time, include a brief explanation of why that time slot was chosen and how it satisfies all constraints. This will allow easier debugging and help identify if preferences are being considered during decision-making.",

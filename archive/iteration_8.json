  "approach_summary": "This script uses a multi-agent approach to schedule meetings, with specialized LLM agents for information extraction, time suggestion, and verification. The problem is decomposed into extracting relevant details from the input text, proposing a meeting time based on these details, and then verifying the validity of the suggested time against the initial constraints. The overall workflow involves sequentially calling these agents and returning a proposed time if verification succeeds.",

This moves the reasoning complexity to the LLM instead of brittle parsing.",
        "3. **Add a solution verifier agent**: Develop a verifier agent that takes the proposed solution and confirms that it satisfies all constraints, including the duration of the meeting and the availability of all participants. The verifier should produce a structured output stating which criteria were satisfied and which were not.",
        "4. **Improve Reasoning Capability for Time Intervals**: Provide more examples of time interval calculations during prompt creation. This way the LLM will be more likely to understand the constraints provided in the questions.",

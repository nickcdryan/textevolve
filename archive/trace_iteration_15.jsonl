The Patriots answered by reaching the Texans 25, but their stiff defense forced the Patriots to settle for a 43-yard field goal by Gostkowski. The Texans responded with a second straight field goal, this one a 45-yarder. After both teams traded punts, the Patriots took advantage of great field position (the Texans 41) and increased their lead to 17-6 with Brady's 1-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski with just 0:14 seconds left in the half. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the second half, and, despite only reaching the Texans 31, Gostkowski was good from 49 yards away, and the Patriots led 20-6. The Patriots forced another punt, but Martin muffed it with recovering at the Patriots 21. However, the Patriots stout defense only allowed 6 yards and the Texans turned the ball over on downs. Early in the fourth quarter, Sheard stripped Brian Hoyer with Malcolm Brown recovering at the Texans 7. Three plays later, James White scored on a two-yard touchdown run, putting the game out of reach. The Texans did nothing on their final two drives and the Patriots won the game. With the win, the Patriots improved to 11-2, and they clinched the AFC East title for a seventh straight season after the Giants defeated the Dolphins the following Monday night.

Chief Blount captured Chief Hancock, and the settlers executed him in 1712. In 1713 the Southern Tuscarora lost their Fort Neoheroka, located in Greene County. About 950 people were killed or captured and sold into slavery in the Caribbean or New England by Colonel Moore and his South Carolina troops. His forces were made up of 33 white men and more than 900 Native American allies, mostly Yamasee and Cherokee, historic competitors to the Tuscarora. At this point, the majority of the surviving Southern Tuscarora began migrating to New York to escape the settlers in North Carolina. Their leader declared that those remaining in the South after 1722 were no longer members of the tribe. They joined the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy, and were accepted as the sixth nation. The remaining Tuscarora signed a treaty with the settlers in June 1718. It granted them a tract of land on the Roanoke River in what is now Bertie County. This was the area already occupied by Tom Blount, and was specified as 56,000 acres ; Tom Blount was recognized by the Legislature of North Carolina as King Tom Blount. The remaining Southern Tuscarora were removed from their homes on the Pamlico River and forced to Bertie. In 1722 the colony chartered Bertie County. Over the next several decades, the remaining Tuscarora lands continually diminished as the tribe sold off land in deals which speculators designed to take advantage of them.\n\nQUESTION: Which were there more of, white men or Native American allies?\n    Answer: Native American allies, as there were 33 white men and more than 900 Native American allies.\n\n    Passage: His forces were made up of 33 white men and more than 900 Native American allies, mostly Yamasee and Cherokee, historic competitors to the Tuscarora.\n\n    Verification:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert at verifying answers, correcting them based on provided context and reasoning."}, "output": "Native American allies, as there were 33 white men and more than 900 Native American allies.\n", "status": "success"}

If a cell's value is the same in the input and output for *all* examples, it's part of a stable region. If a cell's value changes in *any* of the examples, it's part of a transformation region.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis**\n\n*   Input Grid: A 10x15 grid.\n*   Output Grid: A 10x15 grid.\n*   Transformation: Row 5 changes from `[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` to `[0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.\n*   Stable Regions: All rows except row 5.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis**\n\n*   Input Grid: A 12x12 grid.\n*   Output Grid: A 12x12 grid.\n*   Transformation: Top 5 rows transform `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n*   Stable Regions: Rows 6 through 12.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis**\n\n*   Input Grid: A 15x12 grid.\n*   Output Grid: A 15x12 grid.\n*   Transformation: Rows 6 through 15 transform `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n*   Stable Regions: Rows 1 through 5.\n\n**Consolidated Stable and Transformation Regions (Across ALL Examples)**\n\nTo determine the *overall* stable and transformation regions, we need to consider the smallest grid (10x12).\n\n*   **Rows 1 and 2:** Stable (all zeros in all examples).\n*   **Rows 3:** Mostly stable. Cells (0,0) to (0,2) and (0,8) to (0,11) are stable. (0,2) to (0,7) are transformation (Example 3).\n*   **Rows 4:** Mostly stable. Cells (0,0) to (0,2) and (0,8) to (0,11) are stable. (0,3) to (0,7) are transformation (Example 3).\n*   **Rows 5:** Mostly stable. Cells (0,0) to (0,3) and (0,6) to (0,11) are stable. (0,4) and (0,5) are transformation (Example 3).\n*   **Rows 6-9:** All cells are transformational.\n*   **Row 10:** All cells are stable (zeros in all examples).\n\n**Detailed Breakdown**\n\nGiven the limitations of describing this textually, I'll adopt a concise notation:\n\n*   `S`: Stable\n*   `T`: Transformational\n\nWe're considering a 10x12 grid.\n\n*   **Row 1:** `[S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S]`\n*   **Row 2:** `[S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S]`\n*   **Row 3:** `[S, S, T, T, T, T, T, S, S, S, S, S]`\n*   **Row 4:** `[S, S, S, T, T, T, T, S, S, S, S, S]`\n*   **Row 5:** `[S, S, S, S, T, T, S, S, S, S, S, S]`\n*   **Row 6:** `[T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T]`\n*   **Row 7:** `[T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T]`\n*   **Row 8:** `[T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T]`\n*   **Row 9:** `[T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T, T]`\n*   **Row 10:** `[S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S, S]`\n\n**Important Considerations and Improvements**\n\n*   **Overlapping Regions:** My analysis highlights where at least *one* transformation occurs. There might be overlapping transformation patterns within these regions. To precisely identify those you would need to provide more examples.\n*   **Rule Extraction:** This analysis is descriptive. To build a predictive model, you'd want to identify the *rules* that govern these transformations (e.g., \"if a cell is surrounded by 'x', change to 'y'\"). More examples are needed to infer the rules.\n\nI hope this comprehensive analysis is helpful! Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any aspect.\n\n    Transformation Constraints:\n    Based on the consolidated stable regions identified in the previous analysis, here are the transformation constraints.  I will express these as concisely as possible, focusing on what *must* remain unchanged:\n\n**Transformation Constraints:**\n\n1.  **Rows 1 and 2 are invariant:** The values in rows 1 and 2 must remain identical to their initial values during any transformation.\n\n2.  **Row 3 has partially stable regions:** Cells (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,8), (3,9), (3,10), and (3,11) must remain unchanged during the transformation.\n\n3.  **Row 4 has partially stable regions:** Cells (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10), and (4,11) must remain unchanged during the transformation.\n\n4.  **Row 5 has partially stable regions:** Cells (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), and (5,11) must remain unchanged during the transformation.\n\n5.  **Row 10 is invariant:** The values in row 10 must remain identical to their initial values during any transformation.\n\n    Transformed Grid:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert in applying grid transformations based on transformation regions and constraints."}, "output": "Okay, given the input grid, transformation regions (implicitly defined by what *isn't* constrained), and the transformation constraints, let's construct the transformed grid.

More examples are needed to determine the precise rule.\n*   **No Matching Row:** The current examples don't show what happens if *no* row has all identical values. That would be a crucial test case.\n*   **Multiple Matching Rows:** The current examples don't show what happens if *multiple* rows have all identical values. We need an example.\n\nTherefore, with more examples, we could make more definitive statements about stable regions, but with the existing information, the entire grid acts as a transformation region.\n\n    Transformation Constraints:\n    Okay, based on the analysis and identified transformation logic, here are the transformation constraints.  Since the entire grid is subject to change, the constraints are framed as rules governing the transformation process:\n\n**Transformation Constraints:**\n\n1.  **Row Matching Condition:** The transformation is triggered only when at least one row in the input grid has all identical values. If no such row exists, the transformation's behavior is undefined based on the provided examples (more examples are needed to define this).\n\n2.  **Row Index Significance:** The row index of the matched row (the row with all identical values) is crucial.  Let's call this index `matched_row_index`.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rules Based on `matched_row_index`:**\n\n    *   **Rows Above:** For all rows with index `i` where `i < matched_row_index`, all cells in row `i` of the output grid must be set to `0`.\n\n    *   **Matching Row:** For the row with index `matched_row_index`, all cells in that row of the output grid must be set to `5`.\n\n    *   **Rows Below:** For all rows with index `i` where `i > matched_row_index`, all cells in row `i` of the output grid must be set to `0` OR `5`.  *Further examples are needed to determine the precise rule for differentiating between 0 and 5 in these rows.*\n\n**Summary of Constraints in a More Formal Style:**\n\nLet:\n\n*   `input_grid[row][col]` represent the value at row `row`, column `col` of the input grid.\n*   `output_grid[row][col]` represent the value at row `row`, column `col` of the output grid.\n*   `N` be the number of rows (and columns) in the grid (in this case, `N = 3`).\n*   `matched_row_index` be the index of the row where all values are identical in the input grid.  If no such row exists, the transformation is undefined with the current information.\n\nThen:\n\n1.  **Condition:**  \u2203 `r` \u2208 {0, 1, ..., N-1} such that \u2200 `c1`, `c2` \u2208 {0, 1, ..., N-1}, `input_grid[r][c1] == input_grid[r][c2]`.  If this condition is false, the behavior is undefined.  Let `matched_row_index` be one such `r`.\n\n2.  **Constraints:**\n\n    *   \u2200 `row` \u2208 {0, 1, ..., `matched_row_index` - 1}, \u2200 `col` \u2208 {0, 1, ..., N-1}, `output_grid[row][col] = 0`.\n\n    *   \u2200 `col` \u2208 {0, 1, ..., N-1}, `output_grid[matched_row_index][col] = 5`.\n\n    *   \u2200 `row` \u2208 {`matched_row_index` + 1, ..., N-1}, \u2200 `col` \u2208 {0, 1, ..., N-1}, `output_grid[row][col] \u2208 {0, 5}`. (Requires more examples to refine).\n\nThese constraints capture the observed transformation logic.  The key uncertainty lies in how to determine whether rows below the `matched_row_index` should be filled with 0 or 5.\n\n    Transformed Grid:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert in applying grid transformations based on transformation regions and constraints."}, "output": "Okay, I've got the input grid, the transformation regions (which is the entire grid), and the transformation constraints.

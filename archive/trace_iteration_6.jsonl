This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game.

Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game.

Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line.

On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game. With their second consecutive overtime loss, the Steelers fell to 6-5.\n\nQUESTION: How many more points did the Ravens score than the Steelers?\n        Synthesized Answer: First, calculate the total points scored by the Ravens: 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 18 points\nNext, calculate the total points scored by the Steelers: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 points\nFinally, calculate the difference between the Ravens' score and the Steelers' score: 18 - 15 = 3 points\n\nFinal Answer: 3 points\n\n\n        Example:\n        Original Question: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?\n        Synthesized Answer: 59 yards\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Is the answer correct and complete?

Following the opening kickoff, Brady put together a 14-play 60-yard drive. The Patriots drove to the Saints 12, but on 3rd-and-7 Tom Brady was sacked for a 5-yard loss forcing them to settle for Stephen Gostkowski's 35-yard field goal to take the opening lead 3-0. The Saints went 3-and-out on their opening drive and the Patriots followed that with a 3-and-out of their own. The Saints responded by marching 73 yards taking over five minutes off the clock  with Drew Brees tossing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Travaris Cadet. The Patriots immediately responded by slowly moving 80 yards to take a 10-7 lead on Stevan Ridley's 1-yard touchdown run. The Saints went 3-and-out yet again on their next drive and the Patriots took advantage with a long drive taking up 4:52 seconds in 12 plays as they marched 69 yards to increase their lead to 17-7 on another Stevan Ridley touchdown run, this one from 4 yards out. Punts filled the&#160;!of the half and the Patriots led 17-7 at halftime. The Saints took the opening kickoff of the second half 70 yards to the Patriots 10, but the Patriots kept them out of the end zone and Garrett Hartley kicked a 28-yard field goal to trim the lead 17-10. After a Patriots 3-and-out, the Saints stormed 67 yards with Khiry Robinson rushing for a 3-yard touchdown to suddenly tie the game at 17. The Patriots managed to respond on the follow-up drive marching 54 yards in 12 plays, but settled for Gostkowski's 54-yard field goal to retake the lead 20-17. Early in the fourth quarter on 3rd-and-12, the Drew Brees called a timeout to avoid delay of game, but the referees didn't see it so Brees was forced to snap the ball. Brees forced a pass intended for Jimmy Graham, but was by Kyle Arrington at the Saints 25 and returned for 5 yards to the Saints 20. The Patriots managed to reach the Saints 5-yard line, but were kept out of the end zone and Gostkowski kicked a 23-yard field goal to increase th Patriots lead to 23-17. The Saints immediately responded by storming 81 yards in 5:05 with Brees connecting with Kenny Stills on a 34-yard touchdown pass on 3rd-and-20, giving the Saints their second lead of the night 24-23. Four straight incompletions from Brady on the next drive seemingly ended the game, but the Patriots held the Saints to only three yards and Hartley kicked a 39-yard field goal to increase the lead to 27-23. Brady threw a seemingly game deciding interception with just 2:16 remaining but once again, the Patriots defense managed to hold the Saints to a 3-and-out (mostly due to the Saints erratic play calling). Brady got the ball back at his own 30 with 1:13 remaining and no timeouts, and mounted his 39th career game-winning drive. Tom Brady hit Edelman for 23 yards on the first play to move the ball to the Saints 47. He then completed passes to Austin Collie for 15 yards and Aaron Dobson for 6 yards moving the ball to the Saints 26-yard line with 0:35 seconds left. Back-to-back incompletions set up a 4th-and-4. Brady completed a pass to Collie again for 9 yards. Brady spiked the ball at the 17 with&#160;:10 seconds remaining. On the very next play, Brady connected with Thompkins for a 7-yard touchdown pass with five seconds remaining on the clock giving the Patriots the 30-27 lead. The Saints attempted a hook-and-lateral on the kickoff, but Darren Sproles fumbled and Jamie Collins recovered to end the game. The win (his 28th comeback win and 40th game-winning 4th quarter drive) was also his first in four tries against a Drew Brees-quarterbacked team. With the exception of the final drive, the Patriots pass protection was horrid allowing 5 sacks. The Patriots pass defense played very well, with vaunted tight end Jimmy Graham not catching a single pass all night.\n\nQUESTION: How many yards was the longest drive of the first half?"}

The Patriots immediately responded by slowly moving 80 yards to take a 10-7 lead on Stevan Ridley's 1-yard touchdown run. The Saints went 3-and-out yet again on their next drive and the Patriots took advantage with a long drive taking up 4:52 seconds in 12 plays as they marched 69 yards to increase their lead to 17-7 on another Stevan Ridley touchdown run, this one from 4 yards out. Punts filled the&#160;!of the half and the Patriots led 17-7 at halftime. The Saints took the opening kickoff of the second half 70 yards to the Patriots 10, but the Patriots kept them out of the end zone and Garrett Hartley kicked a 28-yard field goal to trim the lead 17-10. After a Patriots 3-and-out, the Saints stormed 67 yards with Khiry Robinson rushing for a 3-yard touchdown to suddenly tie the game at 17. The Patriots managed to respond on the follow-up drive marching 54 yards in 12 plays, but settled for Gostkowski's 54-yard field goal to retake the lead 20-17. Early in the fourth quarter on 3rd-and-12, the Drew Brees called a timeout to avoid delay of game, but the referees didn't see it so Brees was forced to snap the ball. Brees forced a pass intended for Jimmy Graham, but was by Kyle Arrington at the Saints 25 and returned for 5 yards to the Saints 20. The Patriots managed to reach the Saints 5-yard line, but were kept out of the end zone and Gostkowski kicked a 23-yard field goal to increase th Patriots lead to 23-17. The Saints immediately responded by storming 81 yards in 5:05 with Brees connecting with Kenny Stills on a 34-yard touchdown pass on 3rd-and-20, giving the Saints their second lead of the night 24-23. Four straight incompletions from Brady on the next drive seemingly ended the game, but the Patriots held the Saints to only three yards and Hartley kicked a 39-yard field goal to increase the lead to 27-23. Brady threw a seemingly game deciding interception with just 2:16 remaining but once again, the Patriots defense managed to hold the Saints to a 3-and-out (mostly due to the Saints erratic play calling). Brady got the ball back at his own 30 with 1:13 remaining and no timeouts, and mounted his 39th career game-winning drive. Tom Brady hit Edelman for 23 yards on the first play to move the ball to the Saints 47. He then completed passes to Austin Collie for 15 yards and Aaron Dobson for 6 yards moving the ball to the Saints 26-yard line with 0:35 seconds left. Back-to-back incompletions set up a 4th-and-4. Brady completed a pass to Collie again for 9 yards. Brady spiked the ball at the 17 with&#160;:10 seconds remaining. On the very next play, Brady connected with Thompkins for a 7-yard touchdown pass with five seconds remaining on the clock giving the Patriots the 30-27 lead. The Saints attempted a hook-and-lateral on the kickoff, but Darren Sproles fumbled and Jamie Collins recovered to end the game. The win (his 28th comeback win and 40th game-winning 4th quarter drive) was also his first in four tries against a Drew Brees-quarterbacked team. With the exception of the final drive, the Patriots pass protection was horrid allowing 5 sacks.

Up 3-0, the Oakland defense took the field and was unable to stop the Seahawks from responding. Seattle took advantage of the multiple flags against the defense as Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson facilitated a 72-yard drive to score the game's first touchdown on a 3 yard run by Lynch.

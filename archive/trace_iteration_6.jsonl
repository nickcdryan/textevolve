In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.  In the second quarter, the Jaguars got on the board with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run.

Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 \u00b1 0.01 (2.45 \u00b7 108) centimetre\u00b7second\u22122, or approximately 250,000 of Earths gravity.\n\n    Keywords: star, mass, Nu Phoenicis, Gliese 915\n    Relevant Sentence: Gliese 915 has around 85% of the mass of the Sun.\n\n    Example 3:\n    Question: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown pass than the longest field goal?\n    Passage: Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West divisional rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome. Peyton Manning finished the day with the first 0.0 passer rating of his career.\n\n    Keywords: yards, longest touchdown pass, longest field goal\n    Relevant Sentence: The Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry.

In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.  In the second quarter, the Jaguars got on the board with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Colts replied with Manning and Clark hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, Jacksonville tried to come back as QB David Garrard completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Mercedes Lewis for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with Manning completing a 1-yard TD pass to RB Luke Lawton. Afterwards, Jacksonville tried to come back as Garrard completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt (along with getting the 2-point conversion run).

Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 \u00b1 0.01 (2.45 \u00b7 108) centimetre\u00b7second\u22122, or approximately 250,000 of Earths gravity.\n\n    Keywords: star, mass, Nu Phoenicis, Gliese 915\n    Relevant Sentence: Gliese 915 has around 85% of the mass of the Sun.\n\n    Example 3:\n    Question: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown pass than the longest field goal?\n    Passage: Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West divisional rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

The Raiders received the opening kickoff and immediately scored on their first possession by means of a 48-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. Up 3-0, the Oakland defense took the field and was unable to stop the Seahawks from responding. Seattle took advantage of the multiple flags against the defense as Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson facilitated a 72-yard drive to score the game's first touchdown on a 3 yard run by Lynch. Both teams went 3-and-out on their next offensive possession before Derek Carr was picked off by Seahawks LB Bruce Irvin who returned it 35 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Carr was intercepted again, this time by Richard Sherman. Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka added a field goal to put the Seahawks up 17-3. Meanwhile, the Raiders were unable to stop turning the ball over. After Hauschka's field goal, on the ensuing kickoff, T.J.

Use these keywords to find and extract the most relevant sentence from the original text.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Question: Which player kicked the only field goal of the game?\n    Passage: Game SummaryComing off their Thanksgiving road win over the Falcons, the Colts went home for a Week 13 AFC South rematch with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.  In the second quarter, the Jaguars got on the board with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Colts replied with Manning and Clark hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, Jacksonville tried to come back as QB David Garrard completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Mercedes Lewis for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with Manning completing a 1-yard TD pass to RB Luke Lawton. Afterwards, Jacksonville tried to come back as Garrard completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt (along with getting the 2-point conversion run). Indianapolis' defense managed to seal the deal. With their season-sweep over the Jaguars, the Colts improved to 10-2.

Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 \u00b1 0.01 (2.45 \u00b7 108) centimetre\u00b7second\u22122, or approximately 250,000 of Earths gravity.\n\n    Keywords: star, mass, Nu Phoenicis, Gliese 915\n    Relevant Sentence: Gliese 915 has around 85% of the mass of the Sun.\n\n    Example 3:\n    Question: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown pass than the longest field goal?\n    Passage: Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West divisional rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome. Peyton Manning finished the day with the first 0.0 passer rating of his career.\n\n    Keywords: yards, longest touchdown pass, longest field goal\n    Relevant Sentence: The Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass.

In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.  In the second quarter, the Jaguars got on the board with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome. Peyton Manning finished the day with the first 0.0 passer rating of his career.\n\n    Keywords: yards, longest touchdown pass, longest field goal\n    Relevant Sentence: The Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass.

In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.

Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

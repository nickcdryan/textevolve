  "approach_summary": "This script solves grid transformation problems by dissecting the grid into key values and assembling based on these values using the Gemini LLM. The problem is decomposed into identifying key components, determining assembly rules, and applying those rules to reconstruct the grid, with the LLM acting as an expert in grid transformation patterns. The script utilizes the functions `solve_grid_transformation` which orchestrates the process by calling `call_llm` to generate text-based responses, extracting key components, determining assembly rules, and generating the transformed grid. `call_llm` interfaces with the Gemini API and returns the text response. The overall workflow involves prompting the LLM to extract key components, determine assembly rules, and then apply those rules to transform the input grid, with basic validation to ensure the output resembles a grid.",

The transformation seems to involve expanding certain values around their original positions based on their neighbors or local patterns. Specifically, observe how values like '3', '4', '8', '1', and '2' tend to spread out or have neighboring values influence the expansion. From example 4 the neighbors expand toward the zero if they are similar numbers. In example 3, the 8's expand up and down to the same number.

The transformation seems to involve expanding certain values around their original positions based on their neighbors or local patterns. Specifically, observe how values like '3', '4', '8', '1', and '2' tend to spread out or have neighboring values influence the expansion. From example 4 the neighbors expand toward the zero if they are similar numbers. In example 3, the 8's expand up and down to the same number.

The generated code frequently misses nuances, fails to handle edge cases, or introduces unintended side effects.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Verification:** The system lacks a robust mechanism to verify the generated solution against the training examples. This makes it difficult to identify and correct errors in the code.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Misinterpretation of Expansion Rules:** A common error pattern is the misinterpretation of how different values should expand within the grid. The system often expands values in the wrong directions, to the wrong extent, or under incorrect conditions.\n2.  **Incorrect Rule Sequencing:** The system frequently applies the expansion rules in the wrong order, leading to incorrect intermediate states and a final output that deviates significantly from the expected result.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **inability to accurately translate observed grid transformation patterns into robust and correct executable code**. This manifests as flawed implementations of expansion rules, incorrect sequencing of operations, and a general lack of precision in capturing the nuances of the transformations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Refine Pattern-to-Code Translation:** Improve the system's ability to translate observed patterns into precise and robust code. This may involve incorporating more sophisticated techniques for rule extraction, constraint handling, and code generation.\n2.  **Implement Solution Verification:** Incorporate a robust solution verification mechanism that compares the generated output against the training examples.

This may involve analyzing the dependencies between rules and prioritizing them accordingly.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce Formal Rule Representation:** Instead of directly translating patterns to code, first represent the transformation rules in a formal, machine-readable format. This would allow for more precise reasoning and manipulation of the rules before code generation.\n2.  **Implement Test-Driven Development:** Encourage the system to generate unit tests based on the training examples. These tests can then be used to verify the correctness of the generated code and guide the debugging process.\n3.  **Enhance Spatial Reasoning:** Incorporate more sophisticated spatial reasoning capabilities into the system. This would allow it to better understand the relationships between different values within the grid and generate more accurate expansion rules.\n4.

However, the logic is complex and appears to have flaws in how it handles sequences and adjacent expansions. The generated code itself is verbose and could be simplified. The extracted key components description is verbose, but generally accurate.\n*   **Sample 1:** The extracted key components description appears to understand the desired transformation, but the transformed grid text is a fixed JSON output, regardless of the input. This indicates a complete failure in translating the observed pattern into a functional code solution.\n*   **Sample 2:** The extracted key components description correctly identifies the pattern (last three columns), but the generated code is a fixed JSON output and completely unrelated to the input grid, similar to Sample 1.\n\nThe \"Extracted Key Components\" sections are generally accurate in describing the intended transformation, suggesting the system *can* identify the correct pattern. However, the \"Transformed Grid Text\" sections reveal a significant disconnect between the perceived pattern and the actual code generated, highlighting the \"Pattern-to-Code Translation\" bottleneck.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system shows a basic ability to identify patterns in grid transformations and generate syntactically correct Python code. However, it struggles significantly with translating those patterns into precise, robust, and executable code. The system fails to verify its solutions, resulting in incorrect outputs. The system also lacks the ability to handle more complex rules and apply operations in the correct order.

Improving this will have the greatest impact on overall performance.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Formal Rule Representation Layer:**\n    *   Instead of directly translating patterns to code, introduce an intermediate step where the observed transformation rules are represented in a formal, machine-readable format (e.g., a set of logical statements or a domain-specific language).\n    *   This formal representation should capture the precise conditions, actions, and constraints of each rule.\n    *   This will allow for more precise reasoning, manipulation, and verification of the rules before code generation.  It decouples pattern understanding from code generation.\n2.  **Integrate Test-Driven Development Principles:**\n    *   Generate unit tests based on the training examples *before* generating the code. These tests should cover various scenarios and edge cases.\n    *   Use these tests to guide the code generation process and verify the correctness of the generated code.\n    *   The system should iteratively refine the code until it passes all the tests.\n3.  **Enhance Spatial Reasoning with Graph Structures:**\n    *   Represent the grid as a graph data structure, where each cell is a node and the connections represent spatial relationships (e.g., adjacency).\n    *   Use graph algorithms to identify patterns and relationships between cells, making it easier to define and implement expansion rules.\n4.  **Add Print Statements and Intermediate Outputs:**\n    *   Add print statements to your generated code at many places such that you can see the input grid and output grid at various times throughout the execution. It is especially important to print outputs after individual rules execute.\n    *   This will help to understand why certain numbers are being transformed in certain ways.\n5.  **Implement Input Validation**\n    *   Add input validation and exception handling that catches errors in the input grid and outputs a message indicating why it cannot transform the grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are currently **stable, but at a low level**.  Without significant changes focusing on the \"Pattern-to-Code Translation\" bottleneck, the system is unlikely to improve significantly.\n\nBy implementing the recommendations, the system should begin to show an upward trend in accuracy and robustness.\n",

On the third play of the Bills resulting possession, though, Kyle Orton was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Patriots 39-yard line. The Patriots marched 61 yards in just five plays to take the lead on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Tim Wright. After both teams punted, the Bills lugged 67 yards in just under 5 minutes to tie the game 7-7 on a Kyle Orton touchdown pass to Robert Woods. After a Patriots three-and-out, Orton was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Jones recovering at the Bills 24. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, however, but Gostkowski was successful on a 42-yard field goal try. With 0:06 seconds left in the half, the Bills were attempting to run out the clock, but McCourty stripped C. J. Spiller with Zach Moore recovering at the Bills 42. Brady hit Edelman on a quick 7 yards pass and Gostkowski kicked a 53-yarder for a 13-7 lead at the half. After receiving the opening kickoff of the second half the Patriots reached the Bills 43 in just five plays before Brady launched a bomb to Brian Tyms for a 43-yard touchdown, increasing the New England lead to 20-7. The Bills struck right back with a 13 play, 80-yard drive in just under 7 minutes, culminating in Fred Jackson scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Patriots marched 56 yards on their next possession with Gostkowski adding a 40-yard field goal to increase the lead to 23-14. After a Bills punt Brady led the Patriots down the field and, with just over 6 minutes remaining, found his favorite target, Gronkowski, for a 17-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for an offensive holding penalty on Jordan Devey. This would prove to just be a delay, because Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to LaFell two plays later, capping a 12 play, 80-yard drive. The Patriots now led 30-14 and looked to be well on their way to victory. However, the Bills wouldn't go away quietly. Kyle Orton calmly engineered an 8 play, 80-yard drive, aided by a 35-yard completion on 4th-and-2, that ended in his 8-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan, with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to one possession, 30-22. Starting at the Patriots 7, Brady converted a 3rd-and-16 with a 17-yard completion to Gronkowski, and a few plays later found LaFell on a medium pass, who turned upfield and raced down the sideline for a 56-yard touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 37-22. The Bills reached their own 42 on their final drive, but a sack by Rob Ninkovich and an incomplete pass intended for Scott Chandler on 4th-and-9 officially sealed the deal. Brady completed 27 of 37 passes for 361 yards, with 4 touchdowns and no interceptions. Kyle Orton was equally very impressive, finishing the game  24 of 38 for 299 yards, with 2 TDs and 1 INT. With 4 catches for 97 yards and 2 touchdowns, LaFell continued to be the Patriots awaited deep-threat at wide receiver. Both teams struggled to run the football. Stevan Ridley ran for only 23 yards on 10 carries, while Fred Jackson ran for only 26 yards on 10 carries. Unfortunately, it was later learned the Patriots lost Stevan Ridley and linebacker Jerod Mayo to season ending injuries.\n\nQUESTION: What yard line did both teams score from?"}

Orton was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Jones recovering at the Bills 24. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, however, but Gostkowski was successful on a 42-yard field goal try. Brady hit Edelman on a quick 7 yards pass and Gostkowski kicked a 53-yarder for a 13-7 lead at the half. After receiving the opening kickoff of the second half the Patriots reached the Bills 43 in just five plays before Brady launched a bomb to Brian Tyms for a 43-yard touchdown, increasing the New England lead to 20-7. The Bills struck right back with a 13 play, 80-yard drive in just under 7 minutes, culminating in Fred Jackson scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Patriots marched 56 yards on their next possession with Gostkowski adding a 40-yard field goal to increase the lead to 23-14. Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to LaFell two plays later, capping a 12 play, 80-yard drive. Kyle Orton calmly engineered an 8 play, 80-yard drive, aided by a 35-yard completion on 4th-and-2, that ended in his 8-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan, with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to one possession, 30-22. Starting at the Patriots 7, Brady converted a 3rd-and-16 with a 17-yard completion to Gronkowski, and a few plays later found LaFell on a medium pass, who turned upfield and raced down the sideline for a 56-yard touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 37-22.\n\n    Analysis: ```json\n{\"type\": \"fact extraction\", \"keywords\": [\"yard line\", \"teams\", \"score\"], \"requires_calculation\": false}\n```\n    Verification:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert answer verifier with numerical reasoning."}, "output": "1-yard and 8-yard lines\n", "status": "success"}

The first quarter was all Bears as they scored 17 unanswered points with Robbie Gould nailing a 47-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead followed up by Matt Forte's 5-yard touchdown run to make the score 10-0 and then Michael Bush's 1-yard touchdown run for a 17-0 lead.  The Steelers managed to get on the board in the 2nd quarter when Shaun Suisham nailed a 27-yard field goal to shorten the lead to 17-3, however the Bears increased their lead when Major Wright returned an interception 38 yards for a touchdown to make the score 24-3.  The Steelers came within 14 points at halftime as Ben Roetlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 33-yard touchdown pass to  shorten the score 24-10.  After the break, Gould kicked a 32-yard field goal increasing the Bears' lead to 27-10, but the Steelers answered with 13 straight points starting in the 3rd heading into the 4th quarter as Suisham nailed a 36-yard field goal for a 14-point deficit 27-13 and then a 21-yard pass to Brown from Roethlisberger again shortening the lead to 7 at 27-20.  In the 4th quarter, the Steelers came within 4 points as Suisham nailed a 44-yard field goal to make the score 27-23.  However, the Bears were able to seal the victory with Jay Cutler's 17-yard pass to Earl Bennett for a score of 34-23 and then Julius Peppers' 42-yard fumble return for a touchdown (with a failed PAT) for a final score of 40-23. With the loss, the Steelers dropped to 0-3 but on a positive note the team's 21-point deficit is the largest erased deficit in the franchise's history.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with examples to schedule meetings, decomposing the problem into information extraction, time slot finding, and solution verification steps. Specialized LLM agents are employed for each of these steps: information extraction expert, scheduling assistant, and solution verification expert. The overall workflow involves extracting relevant details, proposing a solution, and then verifying the solution against the initial problem statement.",

So we should change our results to:\n\n- Row 1: (1,1,1) and (1,0,1) => 2,0,2\n- Row 2: (0,1,0) and (1,0,1) => 0,0,0\n- Row 3: (1,0,1) and (0,1,0) => 0,0,0\n\n```python\n[\n  [2, 0, 2]\n  [0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n```python\n[\n  [2, 0, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

However, the system's answers are incorrect, indicating logical or reasoning errors rather than technical ones.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern recognition:** The system attempts to identify patterns in the training examples and apply them to the test input. This is evident in the explanation provided in the success case.\n*   **Structured reasoning:** The system tries to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps. For example, in the success case, it divides the input grid into left, middle, and right sections.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate pattern identification:** The system often misinterprets the patterns in the training examples, leading to incorrect transformations of the test input. This is the primary cause of the errors.\n*   **Lack of generalizability:** The system struggles to generalize the patterns it learns from the training examples to new, unseen inputs. This is evident in the failure to apply the correct transformations in the error cases.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Pattern Identification and Generalization:** The system's ability to correctly identify and generalize patterns is the most significant bottleneck. The system may overfit to the training examples or misinterpret the underlying logic.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect value placement:** In both error cases, the system places numbers in the output grid in positions that do not correspond to the patterns in the training examples. Specifically, the values '2', '4', '0', and '8' appear in incorrect locations.\n*   **Inability to deduce complex patterns:** The patterns in the examples seem more complex than the system can currently handle. The system simplifies the transformations too much, failing to account for subtle dependencies between input and output.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate pattern deduction from the training examples**. The system fails to correctly identify and generalize the transformation rules, leading to the generation of incorrect output grids. The system focuses on simple repetitions and adjacencies, while ignoring more nuanced relationships within the grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern recognition:** Enhance the system's ability to identify complex patterns and relationships in the training data.\n*   **Generalization:** Improve the system's ability to generalize learned patterns to unseen inputs.\n*   **Constraint handling:** Ensure the system correctly applies constraints during the transformation process (though the constraints are implicit in the pattern itself).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement a more robust pattern recognition algorithm:** Explore techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn spatial relationships in the grid.\n*   **Increase the number and diversity of training examples:** Provide the system with more examples to improve its ability to generalize. The examples should cover a wider range of possible patterns and transformations.\n*   **Introduce a mechanism for reasoning about constraints:** Explicitly model the constraints governing the transformations, such as relationships between rows, columns, and diagonals.\n*   **Add intermediate debugging outputs:** Insert `print` statements to expose the intermediate steps taken by the system during processing. This will allow for more precise debugging of the reasoning process and enable determination of where the reasoning goes wrong. Print statements should show the extracted left and right sections, the comparison results, and the partially constructed output grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information_extraction: Likely successful, extracting the input grid.\n*   constraint_handling: Failed, misinterpreting the pattern of number placement.\n*   solution_generation: Failed, generating an incorrect output grid.\n*   solution_verification: Failed, not recognizing the output grid as invalid.\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n\n*   information_extraction: Likely successful, extracting the input grid.\n*   constraint_handling: Failed, misinterpreting the pattern of number placement.\n*   solution_generation: Failed, generating an incorrect output grid.\n*   solution_verification: Failed, not recognizing the output grid as invalid.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample 1 (Success):** The system correctly identifies a pattern based on the position of '1's around the '5'. It correctly breaks the problem into sections, and attempts to compare the left and right sections. The explanation is coherent, and the final answer is correct (Accuracy = 0.33 or 1/3). The problem solving logic, however, is more convoluted than necessary. The logic and the comments do not align perfectly. The solution shows successful pattern recognition, logical reasoning, and output generation.\n*   **Sample 2 (Error):** The system returns a 7x7 grid filled with '4', '2', and '0'. There is no explanation provided. The output doesn't align with any apparent pattern derived from the input example sets, it suggests the model hallucinates numbers, suggesting a breakdown in pattern recognition. The result indicates a failure in pattern identification and a subsequent failure in applying transformation rules.\n*   **Sample 3 (Error):** The system generates a 11x10 grid filled with '0', '2', and '8'. There is no explanation provided. Similar to Sample 2, the output grid shows no clear relationship to any input grid, indicating a failure in pattern recognition and logical consistency. The result indicates a failure in pattern identification and a subsequent failure in applying transformation rules.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n*   **Inconsistent Output Dimensions:** The expected output dimension seems to be 3x3 or less, but the system is generating larger grids in error cases. This inconsistency is a major issue.\n*   **Lack of Explanation in Error Cases:** The system fails to provide explanations in the error cases, making debugging and understanding the reasoning process very difficult.\n*   **Repetitive Errors:** The recurrence of incorrect value placement across different inputs suggests a systemic flaw in the pattern deduction or transformation logic.\n*   **\"Hallucination\" of Numbers:** The error cases show the system randomly placing numbers ('2', '4', '8') in the output grid, indicating a possible over-reliance on memorization or an inability to generalize from the training examples.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a limited capability in pattern recognition and logical reasoning for grid-based problems.

The system is inconsistent and prone to generating nonsensical outputs.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (rudimentary):** The system can recognize and apply basic patterns in some cases (as seen in the successful sample).\n*   **Structured Reasoning (attempted):** The system attempts to break down the problem into smaller steps.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The system's inability to generalize learned patterns to new inputs is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Error Handling & Explanation:** The lack of explanations in error cases hinders debugging and improvement.\n*   **Output Consistency:** The inconsistent output dimensions indicate a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem constraints.\n*   **Robustness:** The system is not robust and easily breaks down when presented with unseen inputs.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. The system needs to be able to learn underlying rules and apply them to new and unseen data consistently.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Debugging Outputs:**\n    *   **Implement detailed logging/debugging outputs:** Add `print` statements (or use a proper logging library) at each step of the process.  Specifically, log the following:\n        *   The extracted \"left\" and \"right\" sections (or whatever sections are being used).\n        *   The comparison results between these sections.\n        *   The partially constructed output grid at each step.\n        *   The internal representation of the \"learned\" pattern.\n        *   The confidence scores (if any) associated with pattern matches.\n\n2.  **Output Dimension Constraints:**\n    *   **Enforce Output Dimensions:**  Ensure that the system *always* generates a 3x3 output grid (or whatever the consistent dimension is). This could involve adding a post-processing step to truncate or pad the output. Raise an error if the system cannot generate an output with the correct dimensions.\n\n3.  **Explanation Generation for All Cases:**\n    *   **Generate Explanations Even on Errors:** Modify the system to *always* generate an explanation, even when it makes a mistake. The explanation should describe the pattern it *thought* it saw and why it generated the output it did.  This will provide valuable insight into its reasoning process, even when that process is flawed.\n\n4.  **Improved Training Data:**\n    *   **Curate Training Data:** Carefully analyze the current training data. Is it diverse enough? Does it contain examples that explicitly address the types of errors the system is making? Consider adding more diverse examples to cover different patterns and edge cases. Consider generating synthetic data to augment the training set. Focus on examples that require more complex reasoning and constraint satisfaction.\n    *   **Data Augmentation:**  If possible, augment the existing data by creating variations of existing examples (e.g., rotating the grid, mirroring it, adding noise).\n\n5.  **Algorithm Refinement:**\n    *   **Constraint Embedding:** Design the algorithm to respect implicit constraints within the grid transformation.\n    *   **Test Simpler Algorithms First:** Before diving into complex neural networks, explore simpler algorithms (e.g., decision trees, rule-based systems) that might be easier to debug and understand. This can help you isolate the source of the problem.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is **stable with a very low baseline**. While the system shows a rudimentary pattern recognition ability in some cases, the frequent errors, inconsistent outputs, and lack of generalization indicate that the current capabilities are not improving on their own. Active intervention and the implementation of the recommendations above are necessary to drive improvement.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) in the provided error cases. However, the system's answers are incorrect, indicating logical or reasoning errors rather than technical ones.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern recognition:** The system attempts to identify patterns in the training examples and apply them to the test input. This is evident in the explanation provided in the success case.\n*   **Structured reasoning:** The system tries to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps. For example, in the success case, it divides the input grid into left, middle, and right sections.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate pattern identification:** The system often misinterprets the patterns in the training examples, leading to incorrect transformations of the test input. This is the primary cause of the errors.\n*   **Lack of generalizability:** The system struggles to generalize the patterns it learns from the training examples to new, unseen inputs. This is evident in the failure to apply the correct transformations in the error cases.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Pattern Identification and Generalization:** The system's ability to correctly identify and generalize patterns is the most significant bottleneck. The system may overfit to the training examples or misinterpret the underlying logic.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect value placement:** In both error cases, the system places numbers in the output grid in positions that do not correspond to the patterns in the training examples. Specifically, the values '2', '4', '0', and '8' appear in incorrect locations.\n*   **Inability to deduce complex patterns:** The patterns in the examples seem more complex than the system can currently handle. The system simplifies the transformations too much, failing to account for subtle dependencies between input and output.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate pattern deduction from the training examples**. The system fails to correctly identify and generalize the transformation rules, leading to the generation of incorrect output grids. The system focuses on simple repetitions and adjacencies, while ignoring more nuanced relationships within the grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern recognition:** Enhance the system's ability to identify complex patterns and relationships in the training data.\n*   **Generalization:** Improve the system's ability to generalize learned patterns to unseen inputs.\n*   **Constraint handling:** Ensure the system correctly applies constraints during the transformation process (though the constraints are implicit in the pattern itself).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement a more robust pattern recognition algorithm:** Explore techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn spatial relationships in the grid.\n*   **Increase the number and diversity of training examples:** Provide the system with more examples to improve its ability to generalize. The examples should cover a wider range of possible patterns and transformations.\n*   **Introduce a mechanism for reasoning about constraints:** Explicitly model the constraints governing the transformations, such as relationships between rows, columns, and diagonals.\n*   **Add intermediate debugging outputs:** Insert `print` statements to expose the intermediate steps taken by the system during processing. This will allow for more precise debugging of the reasoning process and enable determination of where the reasoning goes wrong. Print statements should show the extracted left and right sections, the comparison results, and the partially constructed output grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information_extraction: Likely successful, extracting the input grid.\n*   constraint_handling: Failed, misinterpreting the pattern of number placement.\n*   solution_generation: Failed, generating an incorrect output grid.\n*   solution_verification: Failed, not recognizing the output grid as invalid.\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n\n*   information_extraction: Likely successful, extracting the input grid.\n*   constraint_handling: Failed, misinterpreting the pattern of number placement.\n*   solution_generation: Failed, generating an incorrect output grid.\n*   solution_verification: Failed, not recognizing the output grid as invalid.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample 1 (Success):** The system correctly identifies a pattern based on the position of '1's around the '5'. It correctly breaks the problem into sections, and attempts to compare the left and right sections. The explanation is coherent, and the final answer is correct (Accuracy = 0.33 or 1/3). The problem solving logic, however, is more convoluted than necessary. The logic and the comments do not align perfectly. The solution shows successful pattern recognition, logical reasoning, and output generation.\n*   **Sample 2 (Error):** The system returns a 7x7 grid filled with '4', '2', and '0'. There is no explanation provided. The output doesn't align with any apparent pattern derived from the input example sets, it suggests the model hallucinates numbers, suggesting a breakdown in pattern recognition. The result indicates a failure in pattern identification and a subsequent failure in applying transformation rules.\n*   **Sample 3 (Error):** The system generates a 11x10 grid filled with '0', '2', and '8'. There is no explanation provided. Similar to Sample 2, the output grid shows no clear relationship to any input grid, indicating a failure in pattern recognition and logical consistency. The result indicates a failure in pattern identification and a subsequent failure in applying transformation rules.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n*   **Inconsistent Output Dimensions:** The expected output dimension seems to be 3x3 or less, but the system is generating larger grids in error cases. This inconsistency is a major issue.\n*   **Lack of Explanation in Error Cases:** The system fails to provide explanations in the error cases, making debugging and understanding the reasoning process very difficult.\n*   **Repetitive Errors:** The recurrence of incorrect value placement across different inputs suggests a systemic flaw in the pattern deduction or transformation logic.\n*   **\"Hallucination\" of Numbers:** The error cases show the system randomly placing numbers ('2', '4', '8') in the output grid, indicating a possible over-reliance on memorization or an inability to generalize from the training examples.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a limited capability in pattern recognition and logical reasoning for grid-based problems.

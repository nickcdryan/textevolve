  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-driven techniques to schedule meetings by extracting information, generating possible slots, filtering based on constraints, and selecting the best slot. The problem is decomposed into four main steps, each handled by a separate function that relies on the LLM for reasoning and decision-making. There is a single agent role in this script, which is an expert meeting scheduler. The functions used are `main`, `extract_meeting_info`, `generate_meeting_slots`, `filter_meeting_slots`, `select_best_meeting_slot`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow, calling the other functions in sequence to accomplish the scheduling task, where each function depends on the prior one to deliver the next step. `call_llm` is used by all the other function to talk with the LLM and it calls `extract_meeting_info` which calls `generate_meeting_slots` which then calls `filter_meeting_slots` and finally calls `select_best_meeting_slot`.",

      "text_report": "Okay, I will provide a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and the specified output format.\n\n```\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show the error message \"Error generating possible meeting slots.\" This confirms the error analysis report's finding of a critical flaw in the solution generation process. The consistent failure across multiple samples indicates a systematic issue rather than sporadic errors. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest proper output formatting, but the core content is consistently an error. There is no variation in the error, implying the system is hitting the same failure point in every execution.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system, in its current state, has extremely limited capability. While it can acknowledge the scheduling request and begin processing, its ability to generate valid meeting slots is non-existent. The system effectively functions as an error reporter rather than a meeting scheduler. The consistency of the failure highlights a fundamental design or implementation flaw. Based on the 0% accuracy, it is effectively non-functional.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\nThe most important strength to maintain, although minimal, is the system's clear demarcation of output with \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END.\" This ensures that, if a solution *were* generated, it could be easily parsed. The explicit error reporting is also a positive aspect, signaling the system recognizes its failure.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\nThe most critical weakness is the inability to generate valid meeting slots. This renders the system completely useless. Further, the lack of detailed error information hinders debugging and targeted improvements. The system's constraint handling, if present, seems to be ineffective or overly restrictive. The current system lacks any demonstrable ability to fulfill its core function of scheduling meetings.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **solution_generation**. The system *must* be able to generate possible meeting slots, even if initially only in simple scenarios. Without this core capability, all other potential features are irrelevant.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Basic Brute-Force Slot Generator:** As suggested in the provided Error Analysis, implement a simplified \"brute-force\" approach to slot generation.  Iterate through all possible time slots (e.g., 9 AM to 5 PM in 30-minute increments) and check each one against the provided constraints. This will provide a baseline working solution, even if not optimized for performance.\n2.  **Refactor Constraint Handling Logic:**  Completely review and refactor the code responsible for parsing and applying meeting constraints (attendee availability, meeting duration, etc.). Focus on ensuring the constraints are correctly interpreted and applied to the slot evaluation process. Use a series of unit tests to validate correct constraint handling.\n3.  **Enhance Error Logging:**  Add detailed logging statements throughout the `solution_generation` process. Log the following:\n    *   All available time slots being considered.\n    *   Each constraint being evaluated.\n    *   The outcome of each constraint evaluation (pass/fail).\n    *   Reasons for rejecting a particular time slot (which constraint failed and why).\n4.  **Implement Targeted Unit Tests:** Create a suite of unit tests for the `solution_generation` and `constraint_handling` components. These tests should cover a range of scenarios with varying constraints and attendee schedules.\n5. **LLM-Driven constraint understanding:** Instead of rigid code, have the LLM examine the constraints and user schedules. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to identify valid meeting times and potential violations.\n6. **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide the LLM with a few examples of how to extract time availabilities and avoid schedule collisions from the given text\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **stable - non-functional**. The system consistently fails to generate any valid meeting slots. There is no evidence of improvement or decline, as the system always produces the same error message. Substantial changes are required to move this system toward a functional state.\n```",

This approach might be less efficient, but it could be more reliable.\n2.  **Improve constraint parsing and handling:** Carefully review the code that parses and applies the constraints. Ensure that constraints are correctly interpreted and applied to the scheduling algorithm. Add unit tests to verify the correct behavior of constraint handling.\n3.  **Implement detailed logging and debugging:** Add logging statements to track the execution flow of the slot generation algorithm, the constraints being applied, and the available slots being considered. This will make it easier to identify the root cause of the errors.\n4.  **Add more specific error messages:** Instead of a generic \"Error generating possible meeting slots\" message, provide more detailed information about why the slots couldn't be generated. For example, report which constraints caused the failure or what available slots were considered.\n5.  **Introduce Unit Tests:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically for the slot generation and constraint handling logic. These tests should cover a variety of scenarios with different constraints and existing schedules.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** solution_generation, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample ID 1:** solution_generation, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample ID 2:** solution_generation, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample ID 3:** solution_generation, constraint_handling\n*   **Sample ID 4:** solution_generation, constraint_handling\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, I will provide a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and the specified output format.\n\n```\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show the error message \"Error generating possible meeting slots.\" This confirms the error analysis report's finding of a critical flaw in the solution generation process. The consistent failure across multiple samples indicates a systematic issue rather than sporadic errors. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest proper output formatting, but the core content is consistently an error. There is no variation in the error, implying the system is hitting the same failure point in every execution.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system, in its current state, has extremely limited capability. While it can acknowledge the scheduling request and begin processing, its ability to generate valid meeting slots is non-existent. The system effectively functions as an error reporter rather than a meeting scheduler. The consistency of the failure highlights a fundamental design or implementation flaw. Based on the 0% accuracy, it is effectively non-functional.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\nThe most important strength to maintain, although minimal, is the system's clear demarcation of output with \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END.\" This ensures that, if a solution *were* generated, it could be easily parsed. The explicit error reporting is also a positive aspect, signaling the system recognizes its failure.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\nThe most critical weakness is the inability to generate valid meeting slots. This renders the system completely useless. Further, the lack of detailed error information hinders debugging and targeted improvements. The system's constraint handling, if present, seems to be ineffective or overly restrictive. The current system lacks any demonstrable ability to fulfill its core function of scheduling meetings.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **solution_generation**. The system *must* be able to generate possible meeting slots, even if initially only in simple scenarios. Without this core capability, all other potential features are irrelevant.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Basic Brute-Force Slot Generator:** As suggested in the provided Error Analysis, implement a simplified \"brute-force\" approach to slot generation.  Iterate through all possible time slots (e.g., 9 AM to 5 PM in 30-minute increments) and check each one against the provided constraints. This will provide a baseline working solution, even if not optimized for performance.\n2.  **Refactor Constraint Handling Logic:**  Completely review and refactor the code responsible for parsing and applying meeting constraints (attendee availability, meeting duration, etc.). Focus on ensuring the constraints are correctly interpreted and applied to the slot evaluation process. Use a series of unit tests to validate correct constraint handling.\n3.  **Enhance Error Logging:**  Add detailed logging statements throughout the `solution_generation` process. Log the following:\n    *   All available time slots being considered.\n    *   Each constraint being evaluated.\n    *   The outcome of each constraint evaluation (pass/fail).\n    *   Reasons for rejecting a particular time slot (which constraint failed and why).\n4.  **Implement Targeted Unit Tests:** Create a suite of unit tests for the `solution_generation` and `constraint_handling` components. These tests should cover a range of scenarios with varying constraints and attendee schedules.\n5. **LLM-Driven constraint understanding:** Instead of rigid code, have the LLM examine the constraints and user schedules. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to identify valid meeting times and potential violations.\n6. **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide the LLM with a few examples of how to extract time availabilities and avoid schedule collisions from the given text\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **stable - non-functional**. The system consistently fails to generate any valid meeting slots. There is no evidence of improvement or decline, as the system always produces the same error message. Substantial changes are required to move this system toward a functional state.\n```"

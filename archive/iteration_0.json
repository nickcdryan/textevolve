  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach by decomposing the problem into constraint extraction, time slot finding, and solution verification. LLMs act as specialized agents to extract meeting constraints, find available time slots, and verify the proposed solution against the initial constraints. The overall workflow involves `extract_meeting_constraints` to extract constraints, `find_available_time` to propose a solution based on those constraints, and `verify_solution` to validate the proposed time; `call_llm` is used to interface with the LLM API. The `main` function orchestrates these steps to provide a final meeting time, returning an error message if no valid time can be found or the validation fails.",

The system consistently identifies constraints and available time slots correctly. However, it fails to select a single \"best\" time, presenting multiple options instead.

The one 'correct' answer is based on pure schedule availability but not using the preferences (in sample 1).\n\nThe system accurately parses participant schedules and identifies conflicts. It also correctly identifies the constraints and preferences. However, the final decision-making process is flawed. The prompt's requirement to find a *single* \"best\" time slot is not effectively translated into the execution output.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\nThe system demonstrates strong information extraction and constraint handling capabilities but is weak in decision-making and prioritization. It excels at identifying feasible options but struggles to select the optimal one. This is reflected in the low accuracy score and the error patterns observed in the outputs.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Accurately identifies and lists constraints from the problem statement.\n*   **Schedule Analysis:** Parses and analyzes participant schedules to identify available time slots.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n*   **Definitive Decision-Making:** Fails to select a single, optimal time slot, providing multiple options instead.\n*   **Preference Prioritization:** Does not consistently prioritize preferences when selecting the final answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n**Definitive Decision-Making:** The ability to commit to a single, optimal solution is crucial. This should be the primary focus of improvement efforts.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n1.  **Implement Scoring and Ranking:** Introduce a scoring mechanism that ranks potential time slots based on preference fulfillment, minimizing disruptions, and other relevant criteria. This scoring should factor into the final answer selection.\n\n    *   **Example Scoring Factors:**\n        *   Fulfillment of stated preferences (e.g., +1 point if Harold doesn't meet after 2pm)\n        *   Proximity to preferred times (e.g., +1 if meeting at 1pm instead of 4pm)\n        *   Equal distribution among days/times (so it doesn't always pick morning meetings)\n2.  **Prompt Refinement - Specific Examples:**\n    *   **Add to System Instruction:** \"Your FINAL ANSWER should be *one single time slot* that is the absolute best option for all parties, considering all factors.\"\n    *   **Add an Example (Few-Shot Learning):** Include an example problem and solution where the final answer is a *single* time slot, and explain why that specific time slot was chosen over other feasible options.\n\n    ```\n    Example Problem: ...[Previous Problem Example]...\n    Solution:\n    Possible Slots: ...[List of Possible Slots]...\n    Final Answer: Wednesday, 2:00-2:30.  While other slots are available, this one best accommodates Alexander's preference to not meet on Monday and Victoria's preference to not meet on Tuesday while also fitting within everyone's schedule.\n    ```\n3.  **Verification Agent Implementation:** Implement an agent that checks that only one slot is outputted. If multiple slots are present, the agent should re-prompt the main agent with this correction: \"Your output includes multiple potential time slots.

Provide the reasons for your choice.\" Limit attempts to prevent infinite looping.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\nThe system's capabilities are currently **stable** with respect to constraint handling and schedule analysis. However, decision-making capabilities are clearly **deficient**, leading to overall low accuracy. Implementing the actionable recommendations should lead to a **positive improvement trend** in the next iteration, specifically addressing the weakness in choosing the single best time slot and appropriately factoring in preferences.\n",

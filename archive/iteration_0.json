  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using the LLM to extract training examples and test input, analyze the transformation pattern from the examples, and apply this pattern to generate the transformed output. It decomposes the problem into extraction, analysis, transformation, and validation steps, using the LLM for each. The function `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process, calling `call_llm` with specific prompts and system instructions to delegate tasks to the LLM, and the workflow consists of extracting data, identifying patterns, applying the transformation, and validating the final output.",

(<string>, line 2)` - This indicates a `SyntaxError` during the parsing or evaluation of the provided input, most likely when the AI is attempting to interpret the input as a Python list/matrix. This directly prevents the system from proceeding.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   The system attempts to generalize from training examples to transform the test input grid.\n*   In Sample ID 1, the system attempts to generate a code-based solution for the grid transformation task, showcasing an effort to create a generalizable function.\n*   The system is able to identify individual transformations rules (sample ID 1).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Data Parsing Failures:** The system frequently fails to correctly parse the input data, leading to errors like the `SyntaxError` in Sample ID 0. This is a critical bottleneck.\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Logic:** Even when the input data is parsed successfully, the transformation logic generated by the system is often flawed, leading to incorrect outputs (Sample ID 1 & 2). The system appears to struggle with abstracting the underlying pattern in the training examples.\n*   **Brittle Code Generation:** The code generation in Sample ID 1 produces overly specific and brittle code that relies on particular indices and values of the input grid. It does not generalize well.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Data Parsing and Input Validation:** The inability to reliably parse the input data (particularly the grid format) is the most immediate bottleneck. This prevents any further processing from occurring.\n*   **Generalization of Transformation Rules:** The system fails to effectively generalize transformation rules from the provided examples. It produces code that is too specific to the training examples or generates incorrect output matrices directly.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **`SyntaxError` during Data Extraction:** This is a recurring problem, indicating a consistent failure to correctly interpret the input format.\n*   **Overly Specific Code Generation:** When attempting code generation, the system creates brittle code that is tailored to the specific values and indices present in the training examples.\n*   **Incorrect Matrix Transformations:** The system fails to perform the correct transformation of the input grid, suggesting a lack of understanding of the underlying patterns.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to reliably parse and interpret the input grid data due to `SyntaxError`. This prevents any correct transformations from being generated.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Data Parsing Robustness:** Improve the robustness of the data parsing component to handle variations in input formatting. Implement comprehensive error handling and input validation to gracefully handle malformed input.\n*   **Generalization of Transformation Rules:** Improve the system's ability to generalize transformation rules from the training examples, potentially through the use of more advanced pattern recognition techniques or more abstract reasoning about the grid structure.\n*   **Code Generation Abstraction:** When generating code, encourage the creation of more abstract and generalizable functions that do not rely on specific indices or values of the input grid. Instead, focus on identifying and applying the underlying transformation pattern.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Robust Data Parsing with Error Handling:** Rewrite the data parsing component to be more robust, including extensive error handling. Use try-except blocks to catch `SyntaxError` and other potential exceptions during parsing. Provide informative error messages to aid in debugging. Consider using a more structured approach to data representation, such as named tuples or custom classes, to improve data integrity.\n    ```python\n    def parse_grid(grid_string):\n        try:\n            grid = json.loads(grid_string) # Use json to load grids\n            # Add validation to confirm that `grid` is actually the correct size and is a list\n            if not isinstance(grid, list):\n                raise ValueError(\"Parsed grid is not a list\")\n            # Add a check that each row is also a list, and all rows have the same length.\n            row_len = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0  # Get the length of the first row\n            for row in grid:\n                if not isinstance(row, list):\n                    raise ValueError(\"Each row should be a list\")\n                if len(row) != row_len:\n                     raise ValueError(\"Rows have inconsistent lengths\")\n            return grid\n        except (SyntaxError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:\n            print(f\"Error parsing grid: {e}\")\n            return None # Return None instead of raising an error so that your AI can handle the error\n\n    # Use this function to parse any grid data\n    input_grid = parse_grid(input_grid_string)\n    ```\n2.  **Refine Few-Shot Examples for Pattern Generalization:** Carefully select and refine the few-shot examples to better illustrate the underlying transformation patterns. Include examples that demonstrate variations in the input grid while maintaining the same transformation rule. Consider adding examples with explanations of the reasoning behind the transformations. For example, for each training example:\n    *   Input grid\n    *   Output grid\n    *   Explanation of the rule, e.g. \"If a '1' exists in the corner, then a '2' appears in the corresponding corner of the output grid\"\n\n3.  **Incorporate Explicit Pattern Recognition Steps:** Before generating code, explicitly prompt the LLM to identify the underlying patterns in the training examples. Ask it to describe the relationship between the input and output grids in abstract terms. This will help the LLM generate more generalizable code.\n    *   \"Describe the transformation that occurs between the input and output grid.\"\n    *   \"What rules appear to govern how an input value affects output values and indices?\"\n\n4.  **Implement a Code Verification Loop:** After generating code, implement a verification loop that tests the generated code on a set of validation examples (separate from the training examples). If the code fails to produce the correct output for the validation examples, provide feedback to the LLM to refine the code.\n    *   Generate a series of new input grids\n    *   Apply your generated code, and see if the transformation produces the correct output grid, given the training examples you have\n    *   Tell the LLM which transformations were incorrect, and ask it to rewrite its code\n\n5.  **Encourage Abstract Code Generation:** When prompting the LLM to generate code, emphasize the importance of creating abstract and generalizable functions. Provide examples of well-structured and modular code that uses variables and loops to avoid hardcoding specific values and indices.\n    *   \"Write a function that takes an input grid and outputs a transformed grid according to the rules gleaned from the training examples.\"\n    *   \"Your function should be general so it can work on new input grids, even if the numbers change.\"\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed (SyntaxError)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful (parsed the grid but the code was brittle)\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (generated incorrect transformation logic)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (due to the lack of testing in the generated code)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Successful\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (generated incorrect output matrix)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Implicitly failed (no explicit check)\n",

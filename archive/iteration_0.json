  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using the LLM to infer patterns from example input-output grid pairs. It uses a detailed prompt that includes multiple examples and asks the LLM to transform a test grid based on the observed patterns, acting as an expert in grid transformations. The problem is decomposed into prompting the LLM with examples and a test case, then parsing the LLM's response as the transformed grid. The functions used are `main` to initiate the process, `solve_grid_transformation` to construct the prompt and handle the LLM call, and `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API. The workflow involves `main` calling `solve_grid_transformation`, which constructs a prompt and uses `call_llm` to get a transformed grid, and then returns the LLM's response.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) reported in the 'output' fields of the provided error cases. The errors are primarily logical, leading to incorrect outputs despite the code running without crashing.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Code Generation:** The system successfully generates Python code to address the grid transformation tasks.\n2.  **Example Incorporation:** The code attempts to incorporate information from the provided training examples, though the implementation of this is often flawed.\n3.  **Constraint Consideration:** The code attempts to incorporate the constraints and relationships present in the grid but the way it is doing it is ad-hoc and error prone.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to accurately identify and generalize the underlying patterns in the training examples. It often resorts to hardcoding rules based on specific values or positions, rather than identifying abstract relationships.\n2.  **Generalization:** The generated code is highly specific to the training examples and fails to generalize to the test input. The hardcoded rules prevent the code from adapting to slightly different input configurations.\n3.  **Logic Implementation:** The transformation logic within the generated code is often flawed, leading to incorrect outputs even when the code runs without errors.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Abstract Pattern Identification:** The inability to extract abstract, generalizable patterns from the training data is the primary bottleneck. The system needs to move beyond rote memorization and implement true pattern recognition.\n2.  **Robust Transformation Logic:** The hardcoded, brittle transformation logic prevents the code from generalizing and adapting to new inputs. A more robust and adaptable transformation algorithm is needed.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Hardcoded Rules:** The code relies heavily on hardcoded rules based on specific values and positions within the training grids. These rules are not generalizable and lead to incorrect outputs for the test input.\n2.  **Incomplete Logic:** The transformation logic is often incomplete or flawed, failing to account for all possible input configurations or relationships.\n3.  **Lack of Abstraction:** The system fails to abstract the underlying principles governing the transformations, leading to ad-hoc solutions that are specific to the training data.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to **learn and generalize abstract transformation rules** from the training examples. The system currently relies on brittle, hardcoded rules specific to the training data, which prevents it from correctly transforming the test input.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's ability to identify and extract abstract patterns from the training data. This might involve using machine learning techniques to identify relationships between input and output grids.\n2.  **Transformation Logic:** Develop a more robust and adaptable transformation algorithm that is not dependent on hardcoded rules. This could involve using a more structured approach to representing transformations, such as mathematical functions or graph-based representations.\n3.  **Constraint Handling:** Enhance the system's ability to identify and apply constraints correctly. This might involve using constraint programming techniques to explicitly model the constraints of the problem.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Machine Learning for Pattern Recognition:** Use machine learning techniques (e.g., neural networks, decision trees) to learn the relationship between input and output grids in the training examples.

It also uses ad-hoc checks based on the number of 1s in the grid and their distribution in even/odd columns. This approach is overly complex, brittle, and fails to generalize. The multiple nested `if` statements indicate a lack of a coherent transformation strategy. The final output, although syntactically correct (a 3x3 grid), is semantically incorrect and unrelated to the input.\n*   **Sample ID 1 & 2:** Output is not a grid transformation but seems to be either unrelated data or it is trying to output the whole grid.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a *very* limited capability to solve grid transformation problems. It can generate Python code that executes without runtime errors and attempts to incorporate training examples and constraints. However, its core reasoning and generalization abilities are severely lacking. The system is essentially memorizing specific features of the training data and applying them in a hardcoded manner, rather than learning the underlying transformation logic.  The system is not capable of extracting abstract patterns.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:**  The system *can* generate executable Python code. This provides a framework for improvement.\n*   **Example Incorporation (Attempted):** The system *attempts* to use training examples.  The intention is present, even if the implementation is flawed.\n*   **Constraint Consideration (Attempted):** The system *tries* to consider constraints and relationships.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:**  Extremely weak at identifying and generalizing underlying patterns. Relies on hardcoded rules.\n*   **Generalization:** The code is highly specific to training examples and fails completely on unseen inputs.\n*   **Logic Implementation:** Transformation logic is fundamentally flawed and lacks a robust or adaptable algorithm.\n*   **Abstraction:** System cannot abstract the underlying principles of the transformations.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition** (the ability to extract abstract, generalizable transformation rules from the training data). Without this, no amount of fine-tuning of the other components will lead to meaningful improvement.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Replace Hardcoded Rules with a Pattern Learning Module:**\n    *   **Immediate Action:** Remove all hardcoded `if` statements based on specific row/column positions and values within the transformation function (e.g., the many conditionals based on grid\\[r]\\[c] values in Sample ID 0).\n    *   **Implementation:** Introduce a separate module (or function) responsible for identifying patterns in the input and output grids of the training examples. This module should *not* directly modify the transformation function.\n    *   **Technique:**  Start with simpler pattern recognition techniques. Before resorting to complex ML, consider techniques like finding consistent differences between corresponding cells in input and output grids across *all* training examples.  For example, if cell (0,0) in the output is *always* the sum of cells (0,0) and (0,1) in the input, that's a potential pattern.\n2.  **Implement a Structured Transformation Algorithm (Phase 1 - Rule-Based):**\n    *   **Replace Ad-Hoc Logic:**  Get rid of the ad-hoc logic that modifies the output grid based on counting 1s or summing rows/columns. This is not a scalable or generalizable approach.\n    *   **Introduce Transformation Operations:**  Define a set of possible transformation operations (e.g., \"copy value from cell X to cell Y\", \"set cell Z to constant value C\", \"shift row R by N positions\", \"rotate subgrid\").\n    *   **Pattern-Based Transformation:**  The pattern recognition module (from Recommendation 1) should *output a sequence of these transformation operations* that are then applied to the input grid to generate the output grid. This creates a separation of concerns and makes the logic more modular.\n    *   **Example:** Instead of `if grid[1][1] == 1 and grid[1][3] == 5 and grid[1][5] == 1: output[1][1] = 2`,  the pattern recognition module might identify a pattern like \"if the middle row contains 1-5-1, set the center cell of the output to 2\". This would then be translated into transformation operations.\n3.  **Focus on Simple Transformations First:**\n    *   **Prioritize Core Functionality:** Don't try to solve all possible grid transformation problems at once. Start with a simplified subset of problems involving relatively simple transformations (e.g., mirroring, rotation, simple arithmetic operations between cells).  This provides a focused testing ground for the improved pattern recognition and transformation logic.\n\n4. **Increase number of examples**:\n    *   **More Data**: Provide the system with a larger number of training examples\n    *   **Different Types of Examples**: Provide different types of training examples to increase the generalizability of the Machine Learning implemented solution.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **stable, but at a very low level**.  Without fundamental changes to the pattern recognition and transformation logic, the system will remain ineffective.  Implementing the recommendations above should lead to a positive (improving) trend.\n",

The errors are primarily logical, leading to incorrect outputs despite the code running without crashing.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Code Generation:** The system successfully generates Python code to address the grid transformation tasks.\n2.  **Example Incorporation:** The code attempts to incorporate information from the provided training examples, though the implementation of this is often flawed.\n3.  **Constraint Consideration:** The code attempts to incorporate the constraints and relationships present in the grid but the way it is doing it is ad-hoc and error prone.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to accurately identify and generalize the underlying patterns in the training examples. It often resorts to hardcoding rules based on specific values or positions, rather than identifying abstract relationships.\n2.  **Generalization:** The generated code is highly specific to the training examples and fails to generalize to the test input. The hardcoded rules prevent the code from adapting to slightly different input configurations.\n3.  **Logic Implementation:** The transformation logic within the generated code is often flawed, leading to incorrect outputs even when the code runs without errors.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Abstract Pattern Identification:** The inability to extract abstract, generalizable patterns from the training data is the primary bottleneck. The system needs to move beyond rote memorization and implement true pattern recognition.\n2.  **Robust Transformation Logic:** The hardcoded, brittle transformation logic prevents the code from generalizing and adapting to new inputs. A more robust and adaptable transformation algorithm is needed.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Hardcoded Rules:** The code relies heavily on hardcoded rules based on specific values and positions within the training grids. These rules are not generalizable and lead to incorrect outputs for the test input.\n2.  **Incomplete Logic:** The transformation logic is often incomplete or flawed, failing to account for all possible input configurations or relationships.\n3.  **Lack of Abstraction:** The system fails to abstract the underlying principles governing the transformations, leading to ad-hoc solutions that are specific to the training data.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to **learn and generalize abstract transformation rules** from the training examples. The system currently relies on brittle, hardcoded rules specific to the training data, which prevents it from correctly transforming the test input.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's ability to identify and extract abstract patterns from the training data. This might involve using machine learning techniques to identify relationships between input and output grids.\n2.  **Transformation Logic:** Develop a more robust and adaptable transformation algorithm that is not dependent on hardcoded rules. This could involve using a more structured approach to representing transformations, such as mathematical functions or graph-based representations.\n3.  **Constraint Handling:** Enhance the system's ability to identify and apply constraints correctly. This might involve using constraint programming techniques to explicitly model the constraints of the problem.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Machine Learning for Pattern Recognition:** Use machine learning techniques (e.g., neural networks, decision trees) to learn the relationship between input and output grids in the training examples.

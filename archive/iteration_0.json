  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-based pattern recognition and transformation to solve grid transformation tasks. It decomposes the problem into analyzing the transformation pattern from training examples and then applying that pattern to a test input. Two agent roles are defined: a pattern analyst and a transformer, each with specific system instructions. The script uses `analyze_transformation_pattern` to extract the pattern, `apply_transformation` to apply the pattern, `call_llm` to interact with the LLM, and `main` to orchestrate the process. The overall workflow involves calling `analyze_transformation_pattern` to obtain a pattern description, then calling `apply_transformation` with the pattern description and question to obtain the transformed grid which is returned in `main`.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided information, formatted for clarity and actionability.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**AI System Description:**  This system appears to be designed to solve visual pattern recognition and transformation problems presented as grids. It receives an input grid and training examples (input/output grid pairs) and is expected to generate the corresponding output grid for the test input.\n\n**Performance Summary:**  Critically low accuracy (0.00%) indicating a fundamental problem in the system's core capability.\n\n**Raw Data Summary:** The system fails on all provided examples.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Format Consistency:** The system consistently generates outputs within the expected grid structure format (using `[[...]]` notation).  This suggests the output formatting and grid assembly component is functioning correctly.\n*   **Transformation Failure:** The content of the output grids bears no discernible relationship to either the input grids or the transformations demonstrated in the training examples. The generated outputs exhibit characteristics of random noise or patterns based on internal heuristics that are unrelated to the input data.\n*   **No Runtime Errors:**  The absence of reported runtime errors in the outputs suggests that the code executes without crashing. The problem isn't *crashing*, it's *producing incorrect results*. The system completes all operations; it simply makes wrong decisions about the content of the output.\n*   **Output Variance:** While all outputs are incorrect, they differ significantly from each other.  This suggests that the \"hallucinated\" patterns or transformations are not consistent across different input scenarios. The system is not consistently wrong in the same way.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently lacks the core capability to accurately identify, learn, and apply transformation rules from visual patterns. While it can parse input and produce a formatted output, it cannot solve the underlying problem. The system exhibits some low-level functionality (grid formatting) but falls drastically short on higher-level cognitive tasks.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Input Parsing:** Successful parsing of input grid format.\n*   **Output Formatting:**  Ability to generate outputs in the correct grid format.\n*   **Absence of Runtime Errors:** The system doesn't crash; it produces *some* output, even if entirely wrong. This gives a foundation to build on.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Severely limited ability to recognize and extract patterns from visual data (grids).\n*   **Transformation Learning:** Inability to learn and generalize transformation rules based on training examples.\n*   **Generalization:** The system cannot apply learned transformations to new, unseen input data.\n*   **Solution Verification:** No apparent mechanism to validate the generated output against the training data.\n*   **Overfitting/Hallucination:** The system seems to be overfitting to noise or hallucinating patterns not present in the data.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most critical capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Transformation Learning.** Without significant advancements in these areas, the system cannot solve the problem.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThese recommendations are prioritized and designed to provide immediate, actionable steps for the next iteration.\n\n1.  **Implement a Minimal Viable Pattern Recognition Module (First Priority):**\n\n    *   *Action:* Replace the current transformation logic with a simplified pattern recognition module. For the first iteration, focus on identifying simple features in the input grids (e.g., presence/absence of specific numbers, row/column sums, basic symmetry). A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) could be used even for this purpose.\n    *   *Rationale:* Get *something* working, even if imperfectly. This establishes a baseline and provides a concrete starting point for more advanced techniques. A simplistic first implementation also prevents overengineering.\n    *   *Expected Outcome:* The system should be able to correctly identify at least some basic patterns in the input data and output grids. Even 10% accuracy is better than 0% because it means that *something* is working.\n\n2.  **Introduce a Validation Step (Crucial for Preventing Overfitting):**\n\n    *   *Action:*  Split the training data into a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). After each training epoch, evaluate the system's performance on the validation set. Use this performance to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.\n    *   *Rationale:*  The current behavior suggests the system is hallucinating patterns or overfitting noise in the training data. A validation step will help identify and mitigate this problem.\n    *   *Expected Outcome:* Improved generalization performance and reduced tendency to hallucinate patterns.\n\n3.  **Debug Transformation Rule Application:**\n\n    *   *Action:* Create unit tests for specific, simple transformations. For example, write a test case that checks if the system can correctly replicate the output grid if the transformation is simply \"copy the input grid.\" Add further test cases that examine increasingly complex transformations.\n    *   *Rationale:* Even if the system *learns* the patterns, a bug in the application logic can hinder it. These tests will determine whether the learned pattern rules are being executed correctly.\n    *   *Expected Outcome:* Identify and fix any bugs that may be present in the pattern-to-output translation, irrespective of the source of those patterns.\n\n4.  **Log Intermediate Representations:**\n\n    *   *Action:*  Add logging to the system to record the intermediate representations of the input data and the extracted patterns. Capture the \"features\" recognized in each input grid and how these are combined to create an output.\n    *   *Rationale:*  This is essential for debugging and understanding *why* the system is making the mistakes it is. It allows for introspection.\n    *   *Expected Outcome:* Ability to pinpoint exactly where the system is failing (pattern recognition, transformation logic, etc.). This will allow for targeted improvements in future iterations.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining.**  Accuracy is at zero, and the system demonstrates no ability to solve the problem. Significant improvements are required to establish a positive trend.\n",

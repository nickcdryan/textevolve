  "approach_summary": "The script employs a multi-stage, LLM-driven approach to answer questions, using chain-of-thought reasoning and verification. It decomposes the problem into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The agent roles include question analyzer, passage extractor, answer generator, and answer verifier, each defined by system instructions in their respective functions. The functions used are `main`, `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, `verify_answer`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `analyze_question` to understand the question, `extract_relevant_passage` to find relevant context, `generate_answer` to formulate an initial answer, and `verify_answer` to refine the response, using `call_llm` to interface with the Gemini model for each step.",

Afterwards, Jacksonville tried to come back as Garrard completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt (along with getting the 2-point conversion run).

      "question": "PASSAGE: Coming off their easy road win over the Rams, the Vikings went home for a Week 6 inter-conference duel with the Baltimore Ravens. Minnesota got off to a fast start in the first quarter with quarterback Brett Favre completing a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian. Afterwards, the Ravens got the only points of the second quarter as kicker Steven Hauschka getting a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikings picked up where they left off with a 40-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell. Baltimore responded with a 22-yard touchdown run from running back Ray Rice, yet Longwell helped out Minnesota by nailing a 22-yard field goal. Afterwards, an action-packed fourth quarter ensued. Minnesota increased its lead with Favre hooking up with Shiancoe again on a 1-yard touchdown pass, but the Ravens continued to hang around as quarterback Joe Flacco found wide receiver Mark Clayton on a 32-yard touchdown pass. The Vikings replied with Longwell's 29-yard field goal, but Baltimore took lead for the first time in the game as Flacco hooked up with wide receiver Derrick Mason on a 12-yard touchdown pass and Rice running 33 yards for a touchdown. Minnesota then regained the lead as Longwell booted a 31-yard field goal after a 58-yard pass from quarterback Brett Favre to wide receiver Sidney Rice.

The system can identify the correct answer when the question is straightforward and doesn't require complex reasoning or inference.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  The system struggles with questions requiring complex reasoning or inference based on relationships between entities and actions within the passage. It doesn't seem to understand \"second longest\" which relies on implicitly sorting or ordering touchdown passes.\n2.  There's a possible failure in correctly parsing the question and identifying the specific information needed from the passage. It seems to pick the first possible answer rather than the correct one.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  Inability to perform ordinal ranking (\"second longest\") within the context of the provided text.\n2.  Insufficient question parsing leading to incorrect information extraction and ultimately, an incorrect answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  The error occurs when the question involves some level of comparison or ranking, indicating a failure in quantitative or relational reasoning.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe system fails when it needs to identify the \"second longest\" touchdown pass. This is due to it not correctly identifying all touchdown passes first and then ordering them by yardage before selecting the second item. The core problem is the lack of a process for systematically identifying all instances of an event and then applying ordering logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the system's ability to identify *all* instances of a specific event (e.g., touchdown passes) and associated attributes (e.g., distance, passer).\n2.  **Reasoning:** Enhance the system's reasoning capabilities to handle ordinal ranking (e.g., \"second longest\", \"third highest\").\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Introduce a structured information extraction phase**: Before attempting to answer, the system should explicitly identify all relevant events and store them in a structured format (e.g., a list of touchdown passes with passer and yardage). This could be done using named entity recognition or relation extraction techniques.\n2.  **Implement ranking and sorting capabilities**: Add functionality to sort the extracted information based on specific attributes (e.g., sorting touchdown passes by yardage).\n3.  **Improve question parsing**: Use more sophisticated parsing techniques to accurately identify the type of information requested (e.g., whether the question requires the \"longest\", \"shortest\", \"second longest\", etc.).\n4.  **Add intermediate debugging outputs**: Insert print statements (or log entries) at various stages of the process (e.g., after information extraction, after sorting) to track the system's reasoning and pinpoint the source of errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract all touchdown passes and their respective yardages.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed to apply the constraint of finding the \"second longest\".\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect solution due to incomplete information.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify that the answer was the *second* longest, not just any touchdown pass.\n",

The overall accuracy of 67% (2/3) highlights the need for significant improvements. The error analysis points to limitations in both information extraction and reasoning capabilities.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs provide limited direct insight, as we don't know the corresponding questions and expected answers for each output.

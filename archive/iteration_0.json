  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings, first extracting participants, schedules, and constraints with verification steps and a ReAct pattern for solution generation. The problem is decomposed into distinct extraction and planning phases, each validated for correctness. The agent roles include specialized extractors and a ReAct-based solver. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `extract_participants_with_verification`, `extract_schedules_with_verification`, `extract_constraints_with_verification`, `generate_solution_plan`, and `solve_with_react_pattern` functions to perform the meeting scheduling.",

This means the code relies on a function that's either missing from the environment, not imported correctly, or has a typo in its name.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the problem description, the intended strengths of the approach are:\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** The system is designed to take into account various constraints related to participant availability and preferences.\n2.  **Solution Generation:** It aims to generate valid meeting schedules that adhere to the provided constraints.\n3.  **Expertise in Scheduling:** The system is designed with the persona of an expert in scheduling.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Missing LLM Interface:** The `call_llm` function is undefined, preventing the system from using the LLM. This is the most critical problem.\n2.  **Dependency on External Function:** The entire system hinges on the availability and correct implementation of the `call_llm` function, making it vulnerable if this dependency is not properly handled.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Missing `call_llm` Function:** Without a functioning LLM interface, the system cannot perform core tasks like understanding the problem, extracting information, and generating solutions.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The system does not appear to have robust error handling to gracefully manage the missing `call_llm` function.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is the \"name 'call_llm' is not defined\" error across all samples. This highlights a systemic issue: the core LLM interaction is broken.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **absence of a defined `call_llm` function.** This prevents the system from utilizing the LLM to process the scheduling tasks. Without this function, the entire system is non-functional.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Implement `call_llm`:** The primary improvement area is to define and implement the `call_llm` function correctly, ensuring it can interface with the LLM API.\n2.  **Robust Error Handling:** Add error handling specifically for cases where `call_llm` fails or is not available. This will allow the system to report errors more gracefully or even attempt alternative approaches.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Define `call_llm`:**\n    *   Ensure that `call_llm` is properly defined and accessible within the environment where the scheduling code is running.\n    *   The implementation of `call_llm` should include mechanisms for authenticating with the LLM API, sending prompts, receiving responses, and handling potential API errors (e.g., rate limiting, network issues).\n2.  **Implement Error Handling:**\n    *   Wrap calls to `call_llm` in `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions.\n    *   If `call_llm` fails, log the error message and potentially attempt a fallback solution or return a user-friendly error message.\n3.  **Dependency Management:**\n    *   Ensure that all necessary libraries and modules required by `call_llm` are correctly installed and imported.\n    *   Consider using a dependency management tool (e.g., `pip`, `conda`) to manage the project's dependencies and ensure that all required packages are available.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nFor all samples (0-4), the following capabilities failed:\n\n*   information\\_extraction\n*   constraint\\_handling\n*   solution\\_generation\n*   solution\\_verification\n*   decision\\_making\n\nThis is because the missing `call_llm` function prevents the system from performing any of these functions.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment report based on the provided information, focusing on actionable improvements:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly indicate a complete failure.  The same error, `name 'call_llm' is not defined`, occurs across all samples. This signifies a fundamental problem: the core LLM interaction is broken because the essential function, `call_llm`, is missing from the execution environment. The outputs also demonstrate a lack of error handling: the error message is simply printed, and the system cannot proceed. The traceback isn't provided, but it's safe to assume the absence of `call_llm` is the initial and fatal point of failure.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently possesses **zero functional capabilities**. The absence of `call_llm` prevents it from performing even basic tasks. All intended capabilities (information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, etc.) are entirely non-operational.  The system is, in its current state, non-functional.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Intended Architecture:** The description suggests a reasonably sound intended architecture based around using an LLM to handle complex scheduling. The goal of using the LLM for constraint handling and solution generation is appropriate.\n*   **Structured Approach (in theory):** The design includes concepts like understanding constraints, solution generation, and scheduling expertise which, if implemented, would be beneficial.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Missing Core Functionality (`call_llm`):** This is the single, overwhelming weakness.  Without it, nothing works.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The system fails catastrophically without any graceful error management.\n*   **Untested Assumptions:** The code likely makes untested assumptions about the environment and the availability of key components.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Basic Functionality (defining and implementing `call_llm`)**.  Until the system can successfully interact with an LLM, no other improvements are possible. This encompasses addressing the root cause of the `name 'call_llm' is not defined` error.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement `call_llm` (Priority 1 - BLOCKING):**\n    *   **Provide a working implementation of `call_llm`**.  This *must* be done before anything else. A placeholder function is *not* sufficient. This function must:\n        *   Accept a text prompt as input.\n        *   Interact with a specified LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, a local LLM).\n        *   Include API key/authentication handling.\n        *   Include robust error handling (API errors, network errors, rate limits).\n        *   Return the LLM's response as a string.\n        *   Log requests and responses (for debugging).\n    *   **Example (Conceptual):**\n\n    ```python\n    import openai\n    import os\n    import logging\n\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n    def call_llm(prompt, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calls the OpenAI API with a prompt and returns the response.\n        Handles API errors and logs requests.\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            openai.api_key = os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")  # Retrieve API key from environment variable\n            if not openai.api_key:\n                raise ValueError(\"OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set.\")\n\n            logging.info(f\"Sending prompt to LLM: {prompt[:100]}...\")  # Log the beginning of the prompt\n            completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n                model=model,\n                messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}]\n            )\n            response = completion.choices[0].message['content']\n            logging.info(f\"Received response from LLM: {response[:100]}...\")  # Log the beginning of the response\n            return response\n        except openai.error.OpenAIError as e:\n            logging.error(f\"OpenAI API Error: {e}\")\n            return f\"ERROR: OpenAI API Error: {e}\"  # Or return a structured error object\n        except ValueError as e:\n            logging.error(f\"Configuration Error: {e}\")\n            return f\"ERROR: Configuration Error: {e}\"\n        except Exception as e:\n            logging.error(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n            return f\"ERROR: An unexpected error occurred: {e}\"\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement Basic Error Handling (Priority 2):**\n    *   Wrap *every* call to `call_llm` in a `try...except` block.\n    *   Within the `except` block, log the error message.\n    *   Instead of crashing, return a structured error message (e.g., `{\"status\": \"error\", \"message\": \"LLM call failed\", \"details\": str(e)}`).  This allows the calling code to handle the error gracefully.\n    *   Consider implementing a retry mechanism (with exponential backoff) for transient errors (e.g., rate limiting).\n    *   Handle `ValueError` exceptions where parsing is involved, log the full JSON string (or the part of the string leading up to the parsing failure) and a meaningful error message.\n\n3.  **Environment Setup & Dependency Management (Priority 3):**\n    *   Clearly document all environment setup steps (e.g., installing required Python packages, setting environment variables).\n    *   Use a `requirements.txt` file (for `pip`) or a `environment.yml` file (for `conda`) to manage dependencies. This ensures that the execution environment has all the necessary libraries.\n    *   Include a check at the beginning of the main function to verify that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **sharply declining** due to complete system failure. Once `call_llm` is implemented, the trend will hopefully reverse and become positive as other capabilities are built upon this foundation.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error across all provided samples is:\n\n`name 'call_llm' is not defined`\n\nThis indicates a fundamental problem: the function `call_llm`, which is supposed to interface with the LLM API, is not defined within the execution environment. This means the code relies on a function that's either missing from the environment, not imported correctly, or has a typo in its name.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the problem description, the intended strengths of the approach are:\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** The system is designed to take into account various constraints related to participant availability and preferences.\n2.  **Solution Generation:** It aims to generate valid meeting schedules that adhere to the provided constraints.\n3.  **Expertise in Scheduling:** The system is designed with the persona of an expert in scheduling.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Missing LLM Interface:** The `call_llm` function is undefined, preventing the system from using the LLM. This is the most critical problem.\n2.  **Dependency on External Function:** The entire system hinges on the availability and correct implementation of the `call_llm` function, making it vulnerable if this dependency is not properly handled.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Missing `call_llm` Function:** Without a functioning LLM interface, the system cannot perform core tasks like understanding the problem, extracting information, and generating solutions.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The system does not appear to have robust error handling to gracefully manage the missing `call_llm` function.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is the \"name 'call_llm' is not defined\" error across all samples. This highlights a systemic issue: the core LLM interaction is broken.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **absence of a defined `call_llm` function.** This prevents the system from utilizing the LLM to process the scheduling tasks. Without this function, the entire system is non-functional.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Implement `call_llm`:** The primary improvement area is to define and implement the `call_llm` function correctly, ensuring it can interface with the LLM API.\n2.  **Robust Error Handling:** Add error handling specifically for cases where `call_llm` fails or is not available. This will allow the system to report errors more gracefully or even attempt alternative approaches.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Define `call_llm`:**\n    *   Ensure that `call_llm` is properly defined and accessible within the environment where the scheduling code is running.\n    *   The implementation of `call_llm` should include mechanisms for authenticating with the LLM API, sending prompts, receiving responses, and handling potential API errors (e.g., rate limiting, network issues).\n2.  **Implement Error Handling:**\n    *   Wrap calls to `call_llm` in `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions.\n    *   If `call_llm` fails, log the error message and potentially attempt a fallback solution or return a user-friendly error message.\n3.  **Dependency Management:**\n    *   Ensure that all necessary libraries and modules required by `call_llm` are correctly installed and imported.\n    *   Consider using a dependency management tool (e.g., `pip`, `conda`) to manage the project's dependencies and ensure that all required packages are available.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nFor all samples (0-4), the following capabilities failed:\n\n*   information\\_extraction\n*   constraint\\_handling\n*   solution\\_generation\n*   solution\\_verification\n*   decision\\_making\n\nThis is because the missing `call_llm` function prevents the system from performing any of these functions.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment report based on the provided information, focusing on actionable improvements:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly indicate a complete failure.  The same error, `name 'call_llm' is not defined`, occurs across all samples. This signifies a fundamental problem: the core LLM interaction is broken because the essential function, `call_llm`, is missing from the execution environment. The outputs also demonstrate a lack of error handling: the error message is simply printed, and the system cannot proceed. The traceback isn't provided, but it's safe to assume the absence of `call_llm` is the initial and fatal point of failure.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently possesses **zero functional capabilities**. The absence of `call_llm` prevents it from performing even basic tasks. All intended capabilities (information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, etc.) are entirely non-operational.  The system is, in its current state, non-functional.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Intended Architecture:** The description suggests a reasonably sound intended architecture based around using an LLM to handle complex scheduling. The goal of using the LLM for constraint handling and solution generation is appropriate.\n*   **Structured Approach (in theory):** The design includes concepts like understanding constraints, solution generation, and scheduling expertise which, if implemented, would be beneficial.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Missing Core Functionality (`call_llm`):** This is the single, overwhelming weakness.  Without it, nothing works.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The system fails catastrophically without any graceful error management.\n*   **Untested Assumptions:** The code likely makes untested assumptions about the environment and the availability of key components.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Basic Functionality (defining and implementing `call_llm`)**.  Until the system can successfully interact with an LLM, no other improvements are possible. This encompasses addressing the root cause of the `name 'call_llm' is not defined` error.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement `call_llm` (Priority 1 - BLOCKING):**\n    *   **Provide a working implementation of `call_llm`**.  This *must* be done before anything else. A placeholder function is *not* sufficient. This function must:\n        *   Accept a text prompt as input.\n        *   Interact with a specified LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, a local LLM).\n        *   Include API key/authentication handling.\n        *   Include robust error handling (API errors, network errors, rate limits).\n        *   Return the LLM's response as a string.\n        *   Log requests and responses (for debugging).\n    *   **Example (Conceptual):**\n\n    ```python\n    import openai\n    import os\n    import logging\n\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\n    def call_llm(prompt, model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\"):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calls the OpenAI API with a prompt and returns the response.\n        Handles API errors and logs requests.\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            openai.api_key = os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")  # Retrieve API key from environment variable\n            if not openai.api_key:\n                raise ValueError(\"OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set.\")\n\n            logging.info(f\"Sending prompt to LLM: {prompt[:100]}...\")  # Log the beginning of the prompt\n            completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n                model=model,\n                messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}]\n            )\n            response = completion.choices[0].message['content']\n            logging.info(f\"Received response from LLM: {response[:100]}...\")  # Log the beginning of the response\n            return response\n        except openai.error.OpenAIError as e:\n            logging.error(f\"OpenAI API Error: {e}\")\n            return f\"ERROR: OpenAI API Error: {e}\"  # Or return a structured error object\n        except ValueError as e:\n            logging.error(f\"Configuration Error: {e}\")\n            return f\"ERROR: Configuration Error: {e}\"\n        except Exception as e:\n            logging.error(f\"An unexpected error occurred: {e}\")\n            return f\"ERROR: An unexpected error occurred: {e}\"\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement Basic Error Handling (Priority 2):**\n    *   Wrap *every* call to `call_llm` in a `try...except` block.\n    *   Within the `except` block, log the error message.\n    *   Instead of crashing, return a structured error message (e.g., `{\"status\": \"error\", \"message\": \"LLM call failed\", \"details\": str(e)}`).  This allows the calling code to handle the error gracefully.\n    *   Consider implementing a retry mechanism (with exponential backoff) for transient errors (e.g., rate limiting).\n    *   Handle `ValueError` exceptions where parsing is involved, log the full JSON string (or the part of the string leading up to the parsing failure) and a meaningful error message.\n\n3.  **Environment Setup & Dependency Management (Priority 3):**\n    *   Clearly document all environment setup steps (e.g., installing required Python packages, setting environment variables).\n    *   Use a `requirements.txt` file (for `pip`) or a `environment.yml` file (for `conda`) to manage dependencies. This ensures that the execution environment has all the necessary libraries.\n    *   Include a check at the beginning of the main function to verify that the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **sharply declining** due to complete system failure. Once `call_llm` is implemented, the trend will hopefully reverse and become positive as other capabilities are built upon this foundation.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to schedule meetings by first extracting relevant information (participants, duration, constraints, schedules, preferences) with the `extract_meeting_info` function and then scheduling the meeting with the `schedule_meeting` function based on the extracted data. The `extract_meeting_info` function also employs a verification loop to validate and correct the extracted information. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `extract_meeting_info` to get the details and then `schedule_meeting` to schedule the meeting. The `call_llm` function is used by both `extract_meeting_info` and `schedule_meeting` to interface with the Gemini LLM API and make calls.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nAll 5 error cases show the same error message: \"Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This strongly indicates a `JSONDecodeError`. The system is attempting to parse a JSON string but is receiving either an empty string or a string that does not conform to JSON format. This likely stems from an LLM failing to produce valid JSON or returning a plain text response instead of a JSON one when the system expects it.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Problem Definition:** The prompt provides a well-defined task with specific constraints, simulating a real-world scheduling scenario.\n2.  **Explicitly States Solvability:** The problem statement assures that a solution exists, relieving the system of needing to handle unsolvable scenarios (at least initially).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **JSON Output Reliability:** The LLM consistently fails to generate valid JSON, leading to parsing errors and a complete failure to solve the problem.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The system doesn't gracefully handle the `JSONDecodeError`. It simply returns the error message, instead of attempting to recover or provide a more informative response.\n3.  **Inadequate Prompting:** The prompt may not be specific enough in instructing the LLM to produce valid JSON, or may not be providing enough examples of the required JSON format.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **JSON Output Generation:** The inability of the LLM to reliably generate JSON is the primary bottleneck. This prevents any downstream processing or reasoning.\n2.  **Error Handling/Recovery:** The lack of robust error handling prevents the system from recovering from parsing errors, making it highly brittle.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent `JSONDecodeError` indicates a systemic issue, not an isolated incident. The LLM is likely either not understanding the instructions about JSON output or struggling to adhere to the required format.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the LLM's failure to consistently generate valid JSON output, leading to `JSONDecodeError` and preventing the system from progressing beyond the initial parsing stage.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Formatting:** Improve the prompt to ensure the LLM generates valid JSON.\n2.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch `JSONDecodeError` and attempt recovery (e.g., re-prompting the LLM with specific feedback about the formatting error).\n3.  **Output Verification:** Add a verification step immediately after the LLM output to check if the response is valid JSON. If not, trigger a re-prompting mechanism.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Prompting for JSON:**\n    *   Provide more explicit instructions in the prompt about the required JSON format.\n    *   Include multiple examples of the expected JSON output within the prompt.\n    *   Use a system instruction that emphasizes the importance of valid JSON formatting.\n    *   Specifically instruct the LLM to escape special characters in the JSON output.\n2.  **JSON Verification and Reprompting:**\n    *   Implement a function to verify the LLM's output for valid JSON syntax using Python's `json.loads()` within a `try-except` block.\n    *   If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, re-prompt the LLM with a targeted error message indicating the JSON formatting issue and requesting a corrected response. Include the original, invalid output in the re-prompt.\n    *   Implement a maximum retry count to prevent infinite loops in case the LLM persistently fails to produce valid JSON.\n3.  **Simplified Output Format:**\n    * If the LLM continues to struggle with complex JSON, consider simplifying the required output format to a more easily parsable string or a smaller JSON object with fewer fields.\n4.  **Fallback Mechanism:**\n    * Implement a fallback mechanism that, upon repeated JSON decoding failures, switches to a simpler processing strategy that doesn't rely on JSON parsing, such as extracting key information with basic string manipulation or regular expressions (though this is less desirable).\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample 0:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to parsing error)\n*   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n*   solution\\_generation: N/A\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A\n*   decision\\_making: N/A\n\n**Sample 1:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to parsing error)\n*   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n*   solution\\_generation: N/A\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A\n*   decision\\_making: N/A\n\n**Sample 2:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to parsing error)\n*   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n*   solution\\_generation: N/A\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A\n*   decision\\_making: N/A\n\n**Sample 3:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to parsing error)\n*   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n*   solution\\_generation: N/A\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A\n*   decision\\_making: N/A\n\n**Sample 4:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to parsing error)\n*   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n*   solution\\_generation: N/A\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A\n*   decision\\_making: N/A\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs are consistently the same error message: \"Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This confirms the `JSONDecodeError` identified in the Error Analysis Report. The system consistently fails to parse the LLM's output as valid JSON. The fact that the error occurs at \"line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" strongly suggests that the LLM is returning an empty string or plain text, not a JSON string at all. There are no variations in this error across the different samples, indicating a systematic failure. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags suggest a wrapper around the response, but this doesn't appear to be interfering with the JSON parsing itself, as the error is happening *within* the response.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nCurrently, the system has **extremely limited capabilities**. While it appears to be able to initiate the LLM and receive a response, it fundamentally fails at the first critical step of parsing the LLM's output. This parsing failure prevents any downstream processing or reasoning. The system is effectively non-functional in its current state.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Clear Problem Definition (Potential):**  The prompt provides a well-defined task with specific constraints. This is a *potential* strength because, in theory, a clear problem definition should make it easier for the LLM to generate a relevant response. However, the parsing issue prevents this potential strength from being realized.\n*   **Explicitly States Solvability (Potential):** The problem statement assures that a solution exists. Similar to the above, this *could* be a strength by simplifying the LLM's task. But the JSON error overshadows this.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **JSON Output Reliability:** The LLM's consistent failure to generate valid JSON renders the system completely unusable. This is the *most* critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The system doesn't gracefully handle the `JSONDecodeError`. It should attempt to recover, but it doesn't.\n*   **Inadequate Prompting:** The prompt is clearly insufficient in guiding the LLM to produce valid JSON output. It may not include sufficient examples.\n*   **No Output Validation:** The system doesn't check if the LLM output is valid JSON *before* attempting to parse it.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **reliable JSON output generation from the LLM.** Without this, the entire system is dead in the water.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, in priority order:\n\n1.  **Enhanced Prompting for JSON (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **System Instruction:** Add a clear system instruction, such as: *\"You are a JSON API. You ALWAYS respond with valid JSON, even if you cannot fulfill the request. If you cannot fulfill the request, return a JSON object with an \"error\" key describing the problem.\"*\n    *   **Multiple Examples:** Include *at least* three examples of the expected JSON output format *directly within the prompt*. Make these examples as representative as possible of the expected responses. These should not be in the system instruction but in the user prompt.\n    *   **Escaping:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to escape special characters (e.g., quotes, backslashes) correctly within the JSON output. Include examples of escaped characters in the sample JSON.\n    *   **Simplified Structure (Initial):** Start with a simple JSON structure (e.g., a single key-value pair) to make it easier for the LLM to get it right.  Once that's reliable, you can expand the complexity. Start with a JSON object like `{\"answer\": \"the answer\"}`.\n    *   **Specific Key Names:** If specific keys are required (like an \"answer\" key), ensure the prompt mandates their inclusion and correct spelling.\n\n2.  **JSON Verification and Reprompting (ESSENTIAL):**\n    *   **Implement a `validate_json` function:** This function should take the LLM's output as input and attempt to parse it using `json.loads()` within a `try-except` block.\n    *   **Reprompt on Failure:** If `JSONDecodeError` is caught, re-prompt the LLM with a *very specific* error message, including the original, invalid output. The re-prompt should say something like: *\"Your previous response was not valid JSON. Here was your response: `[paste LLM's output here]`.  The error was: `[paste the traceback of the JSONDecodeError here]`.  Please provide a corrected response in valid JSON format, as in the examples provided.\"*\n    *   **Retry Limit:** Implement a maximum retry count (e.g., 3) to prevent infinite loops. After the retry limit, return an informative error message (e.g., \"Failed to generate valid JSON after multiple attempts.\").\n\n3.  **Initial Code Focus:**  Focus on getting these prompting and validation improvements working with a *single, representative sample input*. Do *not* try to fix all samples at once.  Iterate on the prompt and validation code until you get a reliable JSON response for *that* single sample. Then, generalize.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **negative**. The system consistently fails to perform even the most basic function of parsing the LLM's output. There is no indication of any improvement in its current state.\n\nBy focusing on the actionable recommendations, especially the enhanced prompting and robust JSON verification and re-prompting, the system can begin to build a foundation for actual problem-solving capabilities.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nAll 5 error cases show the same error message: \"Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This strongly indicates a `JSONDecodeError`. The system is attempting to parse a JSON string but is receiving either an empty string or a string that does not conform to JSON format. This likely stems from an LLM failing to produce valid JSON or returning a plain text response instead of a JSON one when the system expects it.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Problem Definition:** The prompt provides a well-defined task with specific constraints, simulating a real-world scheduling scenario.\n2.  **Explicitly States Solvability:** The problem statement assures that a solution exists, relieving the system of needing to handle unsolvable scenarios (at least initially).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **JSON Output Reliability:** The LLM consistently fails to generate valid JSON, leading to parsing errors and a complete failure to solve the problem.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The system doesn't gracefully handle the `JSONDecodeError`. It simply returns the error message, instead of attempting to recover or provide a more informative response.\n3.  **Inadequate Prompting:** The prompt may not be specific enough in instructing the LLM to produce valid JSON, or may not be providing enough examples of the required JSON format.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **JSON Output Generation:** The inability of the LLM to reliably generate JSON is the primary bottleneck. This prevents any downstream processing or reasoning.\n2.  **Error Handling/Recovery:** The lack of robust error handling prevents the system from recovering from parsing errors, making it highly brittle.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent `JSONDecodeError` indicates a systemic issue, not an isolated incident. The LLM is likely either not understanding the instructions about JSON output or struggling to adhere to the required format.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the LLM's failure to consistently generate valid JSON output, leading to `JSONDecodeError` and preventing the system from progressing beyond the initial parsing stage.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Formatting:** Improve the prompt to ensure the LLM generates valid JSON.\n2.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch `JSONDecodeError` and attempt recovery (e.g., re-prompting the LLM with specific feedback about the formatting error).\n3.  **Output Verification:** Add a verification step immediately after the LLM output to check if the response is valid JSON. If not, trigger a re-prompting mechanism.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Prompting for JSON:**\n    *   Provide more explicit instructions in the prompt about the required JSON format.\n    *   Include multiple examples of the expected JSON output within the prompt.\n    *   Use a system instruction that emphasizes the importance of valid JSON formatting.\n    *   Specifically instruct the LLM to escape special characters in the JSON output.\n2.  **JSON Verification and Reprompting:**\n    *   Implement a function to verify the LLM's output for valid JSON syntax using Python's `json.loads()` within a `try-except` block.\n    *   If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, re-prompt the LLM with a targeted error message indicating the JSON formatting issue and requesting a corrected response. Include the original, invalid output in the re-prompt.\n    *   Implement a maximum retry count to prevent infinite loops in case the LLM persistently fails to produce valid JSON.\n3.  **Simplified Output Format:**\n    * If the LLM continues to struggle with complex JSON, consider simplifying the required output format to a more easily parsable string or a smaller JSON object with fewer fields.\n4.  **Fallback Mechanism:**\n    * Implement a fallback mechanism that, upon repeated JSON decoding failures, switches to a simpler processing strategy that doesn't rely on JSON parsing, such as extracting key information with basic string manipulation or regular expressions (though this is less desirable).\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample 0:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to parsing error)\n*   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n*   solution\\_generation: N/A\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A\n*   decision\\_making: N/A\n\n**Sample 1:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to parsing error)\n*   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n*   solution\\_generation: N/A\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A\n*   decision\\_making: N/A\n\n**Sample 2:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to parsing error)\n*   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n*   solution\\_generation: N/A\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A\n*   decision\\_making: N/A\n\n**Sample 3:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to parsing error)\n*   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n*   solution\\_generation: N/A\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A\n*   decision\\_making: N/A\n\n**Sample 4:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to parsing error)\n*   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n*   solution\\_generation: N/A\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A\n*   decision\\_making: N/A\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs are consistently the same error message: \"Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This confirms the `JSONDecodeError` identified in the Error Analysis Report. The system consistently fails to parse the LLM's output as valid JSON. The fact that the error occurs at \"line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" strongly suggests that the LLM is returning an empty string or plain text, not a JSON string at all. There are no variations in this error across the different samples, indicating a systematic failure. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags suggest a wrapper around the response, but this doesn't appear to be interfering with the JSON parsing itself, as the error is happening *within* the response.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nCurrently, the system has **extremely limited capabilities**. While it appears to be able to initiate the LLM and receive a response, it fundamentally fails at the first critical step of parsing the LLM's output. This parsing failure prevents any downstream processing or reasoning. The system is effectively non-functional in its current state.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Clear Problem Definition (Potential):**  The prompt provides a well-defined task with specific constraints. This is a *potential* strength because, in theory, a clear problem definition should make it easier for the LLM to generate a relevant response. However, the parsing issue prevents this potential strength from being realized.\n*   **Explicitly States Solvability (Potential):** The problem statement assures that a solution exists. Similar to the above, this *could* be a strength by simplifying the LLM's task. But the JSON error overshadows this.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **JSON Output Reliability:** The LLM's consistent failure to generate valid JSON renders the system completely unusable. This is the *most* critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The system doesn't gracefully handle the `JSONDecodeError`. It should attempt to recover, but it doesn't.\n*   **Inadequate Prompting:** The prompt is clearly insufficient in guiding the LLM to produce valid JSON output. It may not include sufficient examples.\n*   **No Output Validation:** The system doesn't check if the LLM output is valid JSON *before* attempting to parse it.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **reliable JSON output generation from the LLM.** Without this, the entire system is dead in the water.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, in priority order:\n\n1.  **Enhanced Prompting for JSON (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **System Instruction:** Add a clear system instruction, such as: *\"You are a JSON API.

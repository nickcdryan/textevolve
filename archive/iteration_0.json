  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to schedule meetings by extracting information, identifying available time slots, proposing a meeting time, and verifying the solution. The problem is decomposed into four steps handled by distinct functions: `extract_meeting_info`, `identify_available_time_slots`, `propose_meeting_time`, and `verify_final_solution`, with `call_llm` handling the communication with the LLM. The overall workflow involves calling the functions in sequential order with the output of one function as the input of the other. Each of the four functions acts as specialized agents with specific system instructions to solve a part of the scheduling problem.",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs highlight several critical issues.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 & 1:** Demonstrate an inability to generate a specific meeting time, providing vague responses instead. This suggests a fundamental flaw in the solution generation logic. The model is seemingly able to extract *that* a time slot needs to be found, but it cannot find the time slot itself.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** Reveals significant issues with solution verification and context handling. It *correctly* identifies a valid meeting time (Thursday, 13:00-14:00) but then incorrectly concludes there are no available slots. Furthermore, it introduces the names \"John and Mary\" from a previous example, demonstrating a failure to isolate the current problem's context. This is a catastrophic flaw. The system can extract data but fails to properly map extracted information to the schedule and constraints.\n*   **Sample ID 3 & 4:** Continue to show the pattern of failing to produce concrete meeting times. Furthermore, Sample ID 4 also struggles with the verification step, similar to ID 2.\n\nThe consistent failure to generate a proposed time slot, coupled with the significant errors in verification and context handling, paint a picture of a system with severe limitations. The core problem is not simply accuracy, but the lack of a functional process for translating schedule constraints into a proposed solution.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary ability to extract information and attempt verification, but its overall capabilities are currently extremely low. The system fails to consistently generate viable meeting times, and struggles to verify the solution, even when a correct answer is extracted. The inaccurate verification logic makes the system unusable in its current form.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system shows some promise in extracting relevant information (participants, schedules, duration). Although this extraction is of limited use if the system cannot actually determine valid meeting times.\n*   **Attempt at Verification:** The system attempts to verify solutions against the extracted information, which indicates a basic understanding of the problem.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Solution Generation (CRITICAL):** Consistently fails to generate concrete, specific meeting times.\n*   **Solution Verification (CRITICAL):** Erroneously verifies potential solutions, rejecting valid times and mixing information from previous examples.\n*   **Context Handling (CRITICAL):** Fails to isolate information from previous examples, contaminating the current problem's context.\n*   **Reasoning:** The system's logical reasoning is flawed, leading to incorrect inferences about schedule availability.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Solution Generation**. The system MUST be able to propose a valid meeting time based on the provided schedules and constraints. Without this, the other features are rendered useless. Improving Solution Verification is a close second, but a more robust generated solution may improve the performance of the verification step.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Programmatic Schedule Parsing and Conflict Detection:** Develop a deterministic Python function to parse schedules into structured data (e.g., lists of blocked time intervals). Implement a conflict detection algorithm to accurately identify available slots. *Stop relying on the LLM for these tasks.*\n2.  **Refine Prompt for Solution Generation with Structure:** Modify the prompt to explicitly request a proposed meeting time in a specific format (e.g., \"Propose a meeting time in this format: Day: [Day], Time: [Start Time]-[End Time]. If no time is available, state 'No time available'.\"). Include an example of a successful answer.\n3.  **Develop a Dedicated Verification Agent:** Create a separate \"Verification Agent\" with a clear system prompt that emphasizes meticulous verification of the proposed time slot against the provided schedules. Instruct it to ONLY use the data from the current problem and to reject solutions that are even partially invalid. Add multiple diverse examples.\n4.  **Implement Re-Act Framework:** Use Re-Act to structure the problem-solving process. The system should Reason about available slots, Act by proposing a time, and Observe the results of the verification before proceeding.

The generation logic needs to be able to synthesize the schedule constraints and propose a valid solution.\n- **Solution Verification:** Completely overhaul the verification logic. The system MUST correctly evaluate if a proposed meeting time is valid based on the provided schedules and constraints. Key problems in the current logic include the incorrect mapping of schedules to people in the prompt, and therefore incorrect inferences being made.\n- **Context Handling:** Prevent mixing information from prior examples with the current problem's context, which is critical for accurate verification.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Refine Prompt for Solution Generation:** Modify the prompt to explicitly request a proposed meeting time in a specific format (e.g., \"Here is the proposed time: [Day], [Start Time] - [End Time]\").\n- **Implement Schedule Parsing and Conflict Detection:** Create a robust schedule parsing function that converts the schedule descriptions into a structured format (e.g., a list of blocked time intervals for each participant).

    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs highlight several critical issues.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 & 1:** Demonstrate an inability to generate a specific meeting time, providing vague responses instead. This suggests a fundamental flaw in the solution generation logic. The model is seemingly able to extract *that* a time slot needs to be found, but it cannot find the time slot itself.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** Reveals significant issues with solution verification and context handling. It *correctly* identifies a valid meeting time (Thursday, 13:00-14:00) but then incorrectly concludes there are no available slots. Furthermore, it introduces the names \"John and Mary\" from a previous example, demonstrating a failure to isolate the current problem's context. This is a catastrophic flaw. The system can extract data but fails to properly map extracted information to the schedule and constraints.\n*   **Sample ID 3 & 4:** Continue to show the pattern of failing to produce concrete meeting times. Furthermore, Sample ID 4 also struggles with the verification step, similar to ID 2.\n\nThe consistent failure to generate a proposed time slot, coupled with the significant errors in verification and context handling, paint a picture of a system with severe limitations. The core problem is not simply accuracy, but the lack of a functional process for translating schedule constraints into a proposed solution.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary ability to extract information and attempt verification, but its overall capabilities are currently extremely low. The system fails to consistently generate viable meeting times, and struggles to verify the solution, even when a correct answer is extracted. The inaccurate verification logic makes the system unusable in its current form.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system shows some promise in extracting relevant information (participants, schedules, duration). Although this extraction is of limited use if the system cannot actually determine valid meeting times.\n*   **Attempt at Verification:** The system attempts to verify solutions against the extracted information, which indicates a basic understanding of the problem.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Solution Generation (CRITICAL):** Consistently fails to generate concrete, specific meeting times.\n*   **Solution Verification (CRITICAL):** Erroneously verifies potential solutions, rejecting valid times and mixing information from previous examples.\n*   **Context Handling (CRITICAL):** Fails to isolate information from previous examples, contaminating the current problem's context.\n*   **Reasoning:** The system's logical reasoning is flawed, leading to incorrect inferences about schedule availability.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Solution Generation**. The system MUST be able to propose a valid meeting time based on the provided schedules and constraints. Without this, the other features are rendered useless. Improving Solution Verification is a close second, but a more robust generated solution may improve the performance of the verification step.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Programmatic Schedule Parsing and Conflict Detection:** Develop a deterministic Python function to parse schedules into structured data (e.g., lists of blocked time intervals). Implement a conflict detection algorithm to accurately identify available slots. *Stop relying on the LLM for these tasks.*\n2.  **Refine Prompt for Solution Generation with Structure:** Modify the prompt to explicitly request a proposed meeting time in a specific format (e.g., \"Propose a meeting time in this format: Day: [Day], Time: [Start Time]-[End Time]. If no time is available, state 'No time available'.\"). Include an example of a successful answer.\n3.  **Develop a Dedicated Verification Agent:** Create a separate \"Verification Agent\" with a clear system prompt that emphasizes meticulous verification of the proposed time slot against the provided schedules. Instruct it to ONLY use the data from the current problem and to reject solutions that are even partially invalid. Add multiple diverse examples.\n4.  **Implement Re-Act Framework:** Use Re-Act to structure the problem-solving process. The system should Reason about available slots, Act by proposing a time, and Observe the results of the verification before proceeding. Enforce a maximum number of attempts (e.g., 5) to avoid infinite loops.\n5.  **Review All Prompts for Concision and Clarity:** Ensure that prompts are as clear and concise as possible, focusing the LLM's attention on the specific task at hand. Remove any extraneous information that might confuse the model.\n6.  **Add Few-Shot Examples with Edge Cases:** Provide examples with two, three, and four participants. Include scenarios where the solution lies at the beginning or end of the week to address any bias towards early-week solutions. Also include edge cases that require complex reasoning.\n7.  **Unit Test the Verification Agent with Clear Test Cases:** Write specific tests with expected results to ensure that the verification step is working as expected.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nDue to the complete lack of positive results (0% accuracy), the overall capability trend is **stable, but critically low**. There is no evidence of improvement, and the system is currently unusable. A complete re-evaluation will be needed after the above recommendations are implemented.\n"

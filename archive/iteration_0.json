  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first using the `extract_meeting_constraints` function with an LLM to extract constraints from the input question and create a JSON object with the data. Then, `find_available_slots` code-based function determines available time slots based on these constraints, and the `propose_meeting_time` function with the LLM suggests the best time. Finally, the `verify_solution` function with the LLM validates the proposed time against the initial question.\n\nThe workflow consists of `extract_meeting_constraints(question)` to get the data, then `find_available_slots(constraints_json)` to find available slots, then `propose_meeting_time(available_slots)` to propose a meeting time, and finally `verify_solution(question, proposed_time)` to verify the solution with a verification check. The LLM acts as an information extractor, meeting scheduler, and solution verifier, while deterministic code identifies available time slots.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error across all provided error cases is:\n\n*   **JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)**\n\nThis error consistently appears within the \"Available slots:\" section of the output, indicating a failure to parse the output of a prior step (likely the step where available time slots are to be determined based on busy schedules). The system attempts to decode a JSON object, but receives an empty string or a string that does not start with a valid JSON structure.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Constraint Extraction:** The system demonstrates a good ability to extract constraints from the problem description, including participant names, duration, day options, time ranges, and preferences. The extracted constraints are generally accurate and well-structured in JSON format.\n*   **Problem Recognition:** The system correctly identifies that the task involves scheduling meetings and understands the core constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Available Slot Generation:** The system *consistently fails* to generate available time slots from the provided busy schedules. This is evident from the recurring \"JSONDecodeError\" when trying to parse the \"Available slots.\"\n*   **Error Handling:** Instead of attempting to proceed with the already extracted constraints and generate possible meeting times based on the constraints, the system gets stuck and requests the unavailable time slots again. The error handling is insufficient; it identifies a problem but doesn't attempt recovery.\n*   **Reliance on Explicit Input Format:** The system seems overly reliant on receiving \"available time slots\" in a specific format (JSON array of strings). It cannot proceed if this information is not readily available in that format. The system doesn't use the busy times of each participant to deduce possible meeting times.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Available Time Slot Calculation:** The *inability* to reliably calculate available time slots from the provided busy schedules is the primary bottleneck. The entire scheduling process halts due to this missing piece.\n*   **Lack of Robust Fallback Mechanism:** When the available time slot generation fails, the system doesn't have a strategy for proceeding with constraint-based reasoning to find a solution.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Consistent JSON Decoding Errors:** The JSONDecodeError related to available slots is a recurring pattern, highlighting a flaw in the process that generates or formats the available time slots data. The error suggests the available slots calculation is producing an empty string or non-JSON output, which the downstream JSON parser cannot handle.\n*   **Requests for Missing Information:** The system repeatedly requests the \"available time slots\" instead of attempting to derive them from the existing busy schedules. This points to a flawed reasoning process and a lack of independent problem-solving ability.\n*   **Inability to Handle Complex Schedules:** The problem descriptions involve multiple participants, varying busy times, and preferences. The system struggles to integrate these factors into a cohesive available time slot calculation.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure to reliably calculate available time slots based on the provided busy schedules and constraints**. This is likely caused by an error in the function that's supposed to take the extracted \"busy\" times and produce the \"available slots\". This step is consistently leading to an empty or improperly formatted string that causes a JSON decoding error. The system does not seem to have a backup mechanism to find a solution in case this happens.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Available Time Slot Generation:** The algorithm for generating available time slots needs significant improvement. This should be robust enough to handle complex schedules and diverse input formats.\n*   **Error Handling and Recovery:** Implement more robust error handling to gracefully manage failures in available time slot generation. The system should attempt to derive available times from busy schedules even if the initial parsing fails, or at least provide a reasonable fallback solution.\n*   **Reasoning and Constraint Satisfaction:** Enhance the system's reasoning capabilities to directly satisfy constraints and generate solutions, even without explicitly provided \"available time slots.\" It should be able to infer available times directly from the busy schedules.\n*   **Input Format Flexibility**: The system needs to be less reliant on a specific input format (e.g., JSON array of strings for available slots) and be able to extract this information even when it is implicitly represented in the busy schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Debug Available Time Slot Generation:**\n    *   Inspect the code responsible for generating the \"Available slots\".\n    *   Add logging to track the input (busy schedules) and output (available slots) of this function.\n    *   Test this function independently with different busy schedule scenarios to identify the source of the JSON decoding error.\n    *   Ensure the output is ALWAYS a valid JSON string or an empty JSON array `[]` if no slots are available.\n\n2.  **Implement a Robust Available Time Slot Calculation:**\n    *   Instead of relying on a single calculation, explore multiple methods to calculate available time slots.\n    *   Consider an approach that iterates through each possible time slot and checks for conflicts with busy schedules.\n    *   Ensure that the algorithm can handle overlaps and partial conflicts.\n\n3.  **Implement Constraint-Based Reasoning:**\n    *   Introduce a constraint satisfaction solver that can directly reason about busy schedules, time ranges, and preferences to find suitable meeting times.\n    *   This solver should be able to operate independently of the \"Available slots\" information.\n\n4.  **Improve Error Handling:**\n    *   When a JSONDecodeError occurs, catch the exception and log the error.\n    *   Instead of simply requesting the available time slots again, attempt to calculate them using an alternative method (constraint-based reasoning).\n    *   If all attempts to calculate available time slots fail, provide a more informative error message indicating that the system could not find any suitable meeting times given the constraints.\n\n5.  **Add Few-Shot Examples of Busy Time to Available Time Conversion**:\n    *   Add few-shot examples to the prompt that show how busy times translate to open slots. For example:\n        *   \"Busy times: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-12:00.  Available slots: 10:00-11:00, 12:00-17:00\"\n        *   \"Busy times on Monday: 9:00-12:00. Busy times on Tuesday: None.  Available slots on Monday: 12:00-17:00.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error across all provided error cases is:\n\n*   **JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)**\n\nThis error consistently appears within the \"Available slots:\" section of the output, indicating a failure to parse the output of a prior step (likely the step where available time slots are to be determined based on busy schedules). The system attempts to decode a JSON object, but receives an empty string or a string that does not start with a valid JSON structure.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Constraint Extraction:** The system demonstrates a good ability to extract constraints from the problem description, including participant names, duration, day options, time ranges, and preferences. The extracted constraints are generally accurate and well-structured in JSON format.\n*   **Problem Recognition:** The system correctly identifies that the task involves scheduling meetings and understands the core constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Available Slot Generation:** The system *consistently fails* to generate available time slots from the provided busy schedules. This is evident from the recurring \"JSONDecodeError\" when trying to parse the \"Available slots.\"\n*   **Error Handling:** Instead of attempting to proceed with the already extracted constraints and generate possible meeting times based on the constraints, the system gets stuck and requests the unavailable time slots again. The error handling is insufficient; it identifies a problem but doesn't attempt recovery.\n*   **Reliance on Explicit Input Format:** The system seems overly reliant on receiving \"available time slots\" in a specific format (JSON array of strings). It cannot proceed if this information is not readily available in that format. The system doesn't use the busy times of each participant to deduce possible meeting times.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Available Time Slot Calculation:** The *inability* to reliably calculate available time slots from the provided busy schedules is the primary bottleneck. The entire scheduling process halts due to this missing piece.\n*   **Lack of Robust Fallback Mechanism:** When the available time slot generation fails, the system doesn't have a strategy for proceeding with constraint-based reasoning to find a solution.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Consistent JSON Decoding Errors:** The JSONDecodeError related to available slots is a recurring pattern, highlighting a flaw in the process that generates or formats the available time slots data. The error suggests the available slots calculation is producing an empty string or non-JSON output, which the downstream JSON parser cannot handle.\n*   **Requests for Missing Information:** The system repeatedly requests the \"available time slots\" instead of attempting to derive them from the existing busy schedules. This points to a flawed reasoning process and a lack of independent problem-solving ability.\n*   **Inability to Handle Complex Schedules:** The problem descriptions involve multiple participants, varying busy times, and preferences. The system struggles to integrate these factors into a cohesive available time slot calculation.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure to reliably calculate available time slots based on the provided busy schedules and constraints**. This is likely caused by an error in the function that's supposed to take the extracted \"busy\" times and produce the \"available slots\". This step is consistently leading to an empty or improperly formatted string that causes a JSON decoding error. The system does not seem to have a backup mechanism to find a solution in case this happens.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Available Time Slot Generation:** The algorithm for generating available time slots needs significant improvement. This should be robust enough to handle complex schedules and diverse input formats.\n*   **Error Handling and Recovery:** Implement more robust error handling to gracefully manage failures in available time slot generation. The system should attempt to derive available times from busy schedules even if the initial parsing fails, or at least provide a reasonable fallback solution.\n*   **Reasoning and Constraint Satisfaction:** Enhance the system's reasoning capabilities to directly satisfy constraints and generate solutions, even without explicitly provided \"available time slots.\" It should be able to infer available times directly from the busy schedules.\n*   **Input Format Flexibility**: The system needs to be less reliant on a specific input format (e.g., JSON array of strings for available slots) and be able to extract this information even when it is implicitly represented in the busy schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Debug Available Time Slot Generation:**\n    *   Inspect the code responsible for generating the \"Available slots\".\n    *   Add logging to track the input (busy schedules) and output (available slots) of this function.\n    *   Test this function independently with different busy schedule scenarios to identify the source of the JSON decoding error.\n    *   Ensure the output is ALWAYS a valid JSON string or an empty JSON array `[]` if no slots are available.\n\n2.  **Implement a Robust Available Time Slot Calculation:**\n    *   Instead of relying on a single calculation, explore multiple methods to calculate available time slots.\n    *   Consider an approach that iterates through each possible time slot and checks for conflicts with busy schedules.\n    *   Ensure that the algorithm can handle overlaps and partial conflicts.\n\n3.  **Implement Constraint-Based Reasoning:**\n    *   Introduce a constraint satisfaction solver that can directly reason about busy schedules, time ranges, and preferences to find suitable meeting times.\n    *   This solver should be able to operate independently of the \"Available slots\" information.\n\n4.  **Improve Error Handling:**\n    *   When a JSONDecodeError occurs, catch the exception and log the error.\n    *   Instead of simply requesting the available time slots again, attempt to calculate them using an alternative method (constraint-based reasoning).\n    *   If all attempts to calculate available time slots fail, provide a more informative error message indicating that the system could not find any suitable meeting times given the constraints.\n\n5.  **Add Few-Shot Examples of Busy Time to Available Time Conversion**:\n    *   Add few-shot examples to the prompt that show how busy times translate to open slots. For example:\n        *   \"Busy times: 9:00-10:00, 11:00-12:00.  Available slots: 10:00-11:00, 12:00-17:00\"\n        *   \"Busy times on Monday: 9:00-12:00. Busy times on Tuesday: None.  Available slots on Monday: 12:00-17:00. Available slots on Tuesday: 9:00-17:00\"\n    *   This will help the LLM understand the relationship between the two.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information\\_extraction (minor - incorrect format handling), solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 1:** information\\_extraction (minor - incorrect format handling), solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 2:** information\\_extraction (minor - incorrect format handling), solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 3:** information\\_extraction (minor - incorrect format handling), solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 4:** information\\_extraction (minor - incorrect format handling), solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n",

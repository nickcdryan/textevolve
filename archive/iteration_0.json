  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to schedule meetings by extracting information, finding available time slots, filtering by constraints, and selecting the best slot. It decomposes the problem into structured steps using functions like `extract_meeting_info`, `find_available_time_slots`, `filter_slots_by_constraints`, and `select_best_time_slot`. The `extract_meeting_info` function uses an LLM to extract relevant information from the input question and returns the information as a JSON object; similarly, the `filter_slots_by_constraints` function uses an LLM to filter time slots based on given constraints. `call_llm` serves as the primary interface for interacting with the Gemini LLM.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe predominant runtime error across all the provided error cases is an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'`. This error occurs in the `filter_slots_by_constraints` function at line 108 of `current_script_0.py`, specifically when trying to access `structured_info.get(\"constraints\", \"\")`. This strongly suggests that `structured_info` is `None` at this point in the execution. The traceback also includes the message `Error decoding JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`, indicating that the system failed to properly parse the initial problem statement into a structured JSON format.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the problem description, the system's potential strengths are:\n\n*   Attempting to structure the scheduling problem, potentially allowing for logical constraint application.\n*   Intended constraint handling, suggesting awareness of scheduling rules and preferences.\n*   A modular design, with separate functions for information extraction and filtering.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Fragile Information Extraction:** The JSON parsing failure indicates a significant weakness in extracting and structuring information from the natural language input. The system relies heavily on this structured representation.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The system doesn't seem to handle the case where the initial parsing fails, leading to a `NoneType` error later on. There's no robust error handling for cases where the LLM may fail to extract needed information.\n*   **Reliance on External Script:** Tightly bound to a specific external script, which could limit adaptability.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **JSON Parsing Failure:** The inability to reliably parse the problem description into structured information is the primary bottleneck. This prevents the system from even starting to solve the scheduling problem.\n2.  **Inadequate Error Handling:** The lack of proper error handling when the parsing fails leads to a fatal `NoneType` error, abruptly terminating the process.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent `AttributeError` stemming from `structured_info` being `None` after a failed JSON parsing is the dominant error pattern. All of the provided errors exhibit this behavior. The LLM is failing to return valid JSON or the returned JSON doesn't have a consistent schema, leading to the parsing failures.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **brittle and unreliable JSON parsing of the initial problem description**. When the LLM fails to provide valid and complete JSON, the entire downstream process collapses because core functions rely on accessing data from the `structured_info` variable which ends up being `None`.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Robustness:** Significantly improve the reliability and robustness of the information extraction process. The system must be able to handle variations in input format and gracefully handle cases where the LLM struggles to extract all the necessary information.\n2.  **Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the system, especially immediately after the JSON parsing step. Provide fallback mechanisms for cases where parsing fails. This might involve using a default set of constraints, prompting the LLM again with a refined prompt, or even using a simpler rule-based approach as a last resort.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Prompt Engineering for Reliable JSON Output:** Redesign the prompt used for information extraction to strongly encourage the LLM to produce valid JSON. Include clear examples of the desired JSON format. Add validation steps immediately after the LLM call to ensure JSON validity.\n2.  **Schema Validation:** Implement schema validation to ensure that the parsed JSON conforms to the expected structure. Use a library like `jsonschema` to define the expected schema and validate the output.\n3.  **Fallback Information Extraction:** If JSON parsing fails, retry the LLM call with a refined prompt. If that fails, consider a simpler rule-based information extraction method to capture the bare minimum required information.\n4.  **Defensive Programming:** Before accessing any element of `structured_info`, add explicit checks to ensure it is not `None`. If it is `None`, trigger the fallback mechanisms.\n5.  **ReAct Pattern Integration:** Incorporate the ReAct pattern to allow for iterative information gathering and refinement. If the initial extraction is incomplete, the agent can \"Act\" to gather more information before attempting to solve the scheduling problem.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample 1:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample 3:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample 4:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling\n",

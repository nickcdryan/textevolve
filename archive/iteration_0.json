      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are present in the provided 'output' fields. However, there's a clear pattern of the system generating a description of a general transformation and a *different* example, rather than applying a specific transformation to the *given* test input. This indicates a logical error rather than a technical one.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1. **Pattern recognition:** The system demonstrates some capability to recognize patterns within the training examples, enough to *describe* the *type* of transformation occuring (expanding a single cell to a 3x3 grid).\n2. **Example selection:** The system is able to select a training example and represent its structure, although not using it to arrive at the correct answer.\n3. **Generalization (limited):** The system appears to understand the concept of a grid transformation, even if it struggles to apply a learned transformation precisely to a specific test case.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1. **Failure to apply learned transformation:** The system fails to consistently and correctly apply the learned transformation from the training examples to the test input.  Instead, it reverts to describing a *different* training input and a *different* target output than the provided test input.\n2. **Misinterpretation of task:** The system seems to misunderstand the ultimate goal of the grid transformation task. It's not enough to *describe* a transformation; the system must *execute* it.\n3. **Inability to verify output:** The system cannot seem to confirm that its generated output aligns with the implied and explicit constraints and patterns of the training examples.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1. **Inability to translate pattern recognition into actionable transformation:** The system identifies the pattern but doesn't translate that knowledge into a step-by-step process for transforming the input grid.\n2. **Lack of constraint application:** The system fails to properly apply constraints, such as the spatial relationships between elements in the input and output grids.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe most prominent error pattern is the system's consistent description of a 3x3 expansion transformation, coupled with an unrelated example. This suggests that the system understands that *some* transformation is occurring on the input, yet cannot produce a coherent, correct output when given the test input.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to accurately translate the recognized transformation *pattern* from the training examples into a concrete algorithm to transform the *given* test input. It seems to get stuck in a descriptive, rather than an imperative mode, choosing instead to use the test example to *describe* a transformation that has already happened.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1. **Transformation Application:**  The system needs significant improvement in its ability to apply learned transformations to new input grids. It should be forced to use the *provided* test input and no other inputs in its calculations.\n2. **Constraint Incorporation:** Enhancing the system's capacity to incorporate constraints related to grid dimensions, element relationships, and transformation rules is vital.\n3. **Verification Loop:** Implementing a verification loop that checks the generated output against the examples would help ensure that the transformations are valid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Algorithm Refinement:** Implement a specific algorithm that focuses on *executing* the learned transformation rather than merely describing it.  For the 3x3 expansion, this would involve iterating through the input grid and generating the corresponding 3x3 block in the output. Make sure to use the TEST INPUT!\n2. **Constraint Enforcement:** Design a constraint enforcement mechanism that explicitly checks the generated output against the learned transformation rules.  This could involve verifying that the element relationships are maintained and that the grid dimensions are correct.\n3. **Intermediate State Visualization:** Implement debug logging to trace the intermediate states of the grid during the transformation process. This will help identify exactly where the transformation is going wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample 0:**\n*   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies *some* transformation).\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n\n**Sample 1:**\n*   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies *some* transformation).\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n\n**Sample 2:**\n*   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies *some* transformation).\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n",

Instead, the system outputs a description of the transformation (\"Each original cell is expanded to a 3x3 block\") and then *repeats the same training example (Example 2)*, including its input and output grids, regardless of the actual input provided.  This is a clear indication of a flawed control flow where the system is short-circuiting the transformation process and defaulting to a pre-canned example. The repeated identical output across multiple runs suggests that the test input is not even being properly processed.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates a very low level of capability in solving grid transformation tasks. While it shows some ability to recognize patterns in the training data, it lacks the crucial ability to *apply* these patterns to new, unseen inputs. The system effectively *describes* the transformation without *performing* it. It appears to be stuck in a descriptive mode, unable to translate learned knowledge into a concrete algorithm.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Partial):** The system can identify and describe the *type* of transformation occurring.\n*   **Training Data Recall:** The system can recall and represent example grid transformations from the training data.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Transformation Application:** The system fundamentally fails to apply the learned transformation to the provided test input.\n*   **Input Processing:** The system doesn't seem to fully process the test input; it likely uses a different input or no input at all to arrive at its output.\n*   **Algorithm Execution:** The system lacks a concrete algorithm for transforming input grids based on learned patterns.\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** The system fails to use the test input, opting for the same training example every time.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary improvement focus should be on **Transformation Application**. The system needs to be able to take a test input and actively transform it according to the learned rules, not just describe the rules or repeat training examples. The entire system needs to be restructured to ensure that it uses the test input and no other inputs in its calculation to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement an Input-Driven Algorithm:** Redesign the transformation logic to explicitly use the *provided test input* to generate the output. The algorithm should iterate over the input grid and create the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid *using the values in the input grid*. Remove all code that allows the system to access or use other grid examples.\n2.  **Force Test Input Usage:** Implement a hard constraint that *forbids* the system from using any pre-existing example grids in its transformation process. The system *must* use the values from the current test input grid.\n3.  **Debugging Tools:** Add extensive debugging logging to track the flow of data from the input grid, through the transformation process, to the output grid. Log the intermediate values and decisions made at each step. This will make it easier to pinpoint the exact point where the transformation logic fails.\n4.  **Unit Testing:** Create a suite of unit tests that specifically target the transformation application logic.

The system consistently fails to perform the task, and without significant intervention, this pattern is unlikely to change.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are present in the provided 'output' fields. However, there's a clear pattern of the system generating a description of a general transformation and a *different* example, rather than applying a specific transformation to the *given* test input. This indicates a logical error rather than a technical one.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1. **Pattern recognition:** The system demonstrates some capability to recognize patterns within the training examples, enough to *describe* the *type* of transformation occuring (expanding a single cell to a 3x3 grid).\n2. **Example selection:** The system is able to select a training example and represent its structure, although not using it to arrive at the correct answer.\n3. **Generalization (limited):** The system appears to understand the concept of a grid transformation, even if it struggles to apply a learned transformation precisely to a specific test case.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1. **Failure to apply learned transformation:** The system fails to consistently and correctly apply the learned transformation from the training examples to the test input.  Instead, it reverts to describing a *different* training input and a *different* target output than the provided test input.\n2. **Misinterpretation of task:** The system seems to misunderstand the ultimate goal of the grid transformation task. It's not enough to *describe* a transformation; the system must *execute* it.\n3. **Inability to verify output:** The system cannot seem to confirm that its generated output aligns with the implied and explicit constraints and patterns of the training examples.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1. **Inability to translate pattern recognition into actionable transformation:** The system identifies the pattern but doesn't translate that knowledge into a step-by-step process for transforming the input grid.\n2. **Lack of constraint application:** The system fails to properly apply constraints, such as the spatial relationships between elements in the input and output grids.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe most prominent error pattern is the system's consistent description of a 3x3 expansion transformation, coupled with an unrelated example. This suggests that the system understands that *some* transformation is occurring on the input, yet cannot produce a coherent, correct output when given the test input.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to accurately translate the recognized transformation *pattern* from the training examples into a concrete algorithm to transform the *given* test input. It seems to get stuck in a descriptive, rather than an imperative mode, choosing instead to use the test example to *describe* a transformation that has already happened.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1. **Transformation Application:**  The system needs significant improvement in its ability to apply learned transformations to new input grids. It should be forced to use the *provided* test input and no other inputs in its calculations.\n2. **Constraint Incorporation:** Enhancing the system's capacity to incorporate constraints related to grid dimensions, element relationships, and transformation rules is vital.\n3. **Verification Loop:** Implementing a verification loop that checks the generated output against the examples would help ensure that the transformations are valid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Algorithm Refinement:** Implement a specific algorithm that focuses on *executing* the learned transformation rather than merely describing it.  For the 3x3 expansion, this would involve iterating through the input grid and generating the corresponding 3x3 block in the output. Make sure to use the TEST INPUT!\n2. **Constraint Enforcement:** Design a constraint enforcement mechanism that explicitly checks the generated output against the learned transformation rules.  This could involve verifying that the element relationships are maintained and that the grid dimensions are correct.\n3. **Intermediate State Visualization:** Implement debug logging to trace the intermediate states of the grid during the transformation process. This will help identify exactly where the transformation is going wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample 0:**\n*   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies *some* transformation).\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n\n**Sample 1:**\n*   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies *some* transformation).\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n\n**Sample 2:**\n*   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies *some* transformation).\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n",

Instead, the system outputs a description of the transformation (\"Each original cell is expanded to a 3x3 block\") and then *repeats the same training example (Example 2)*, including its input and output grids, regardless of the actual input provided.  This is a clear indication of a flawed control flow where the system is short-circuiting the transformation process and defaulting to a pre-canned example. The repeated identical output across multiple runs suggests that the test input is not even being properly processed.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates a very low level of capability in solving grid transformation tasks. While it shows some ability to recognize patterns in the training data, it lacks the crucial ability to *apply* these patterns to new, unseen inputs. The system effectively *describes* the transformation without *performing* it. It appears to be stuck in a descriptive mode, unable to translate learned knowledge into a concrete algorithm.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Partial):** The system can identify and describe the *type* of transformation occurring.\n*   **Training Data Recall:** The system can recall and represent example grid transformations from the training data.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Transformation Application:** The system fundamentally fails to apply the learned transformation to the provided test input.\n*   **Input Processing:** The system doesn't seem to fully process the test input; it likely uses a different input or no input at all to arrive at its output.\n*   **Algorithm Execution:** The system lacks a concrete algorithm for transforming input grids based on learned patterns.\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** The system fails to use the test input, opting for the same training example every time.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary improvement focus should be on **Transformation Application**. The system needs to be able to take a test input and actively transform it according to the learned rules, not just describe the rules or repeat training examples. The entire system needs to be restructured to ensure that it uses the test input and no other inputs in its calculation to arrive at the final answer.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement an Input-Driven Algorithm:** Redesign the transformation logic to explicitly use the *provided test input* to generate the output. The algorithm should iterate over the input grid and create the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid *using the values in the input grid*. Remove all code that allows the system to access or use other grid examples.\n2.  **Force Test Input Usage:** Implement a hard constraint that *forbids* the system from using any pre-existing example grids in its transformation process. The system *must* use the values from the current test input grid.\n3.  **Debugging Tools:** Add extensive debugging logging to track the flow of data from the input grid, through the transformation process, to the output grid. Log the intermediate values and decisions made at each step. This will make it easier to pinpoint the exact point where the transformation logic fails.\n4.  **Unit Testing:** Create a suite of unit tests that specifically target the transformation application logic. Each test should provide a specific input grid and verify that the output grid matches the expected transformation.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **Stable (Negative)**. The system consistently fails to perform the task, and without significant intervention, this pattern is unlikely to change. The stable, repeated failure suggests a fundamental flaw in the system's architecture or training process. The negative connotation is related to the system's inability to utilize the test input and incorporate it into its final answer.\n"

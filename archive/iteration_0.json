  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using LLMs for information extraction, schedule extraction and conflict resolution to find available times that work for all participants. The problem is decomposed into extracting meeting details, extracting schedules, and finding available times using example-based prompting and verification steps. It utilizes functions such as `extract_meeting_info` to extract meeting details, `extract_schedules` to extract schedules and verify extractions, `find_available_time` to find available times based on meeting info and schedules, `call_llm` for interfacing with the LLM and the `main` function ties it all together. The overall workflow involves parsing the question, extracting relevant information, and then using the LLM to determine an optimal meeting time.",

For example, in Sample 3, it correctly identifies the preferences for each participant and attempts to find a solution based on these.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Schedule Extraction Errors:** The system frequently fails to correctly extract and interpret the existing schedules of participants. This leads to inaccurate assessment of availability and, consequently, incorrect solution generation. (Samples 1, 2, 4)\n*   **Inability to Handle Combined Schedules:** In several instances, the system struggles with the format of the provided schedule, particularly when it is given as a combined schedule for all participants. This is evident in sample 2, where it misinterprets the format of the provided schedule, leading to an incorrect analysis of available times.\n*   **Solution Verification Incompleteness:** The system sometimes proposes solutions that do not fully align with all the stated constraints, indicating a failure in solution verification. For example, in Sample 1, the system proposes a solution without fully accounting for Jennifer's blocked schedule.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Schedule Parsing and Representation:** The most critical bottleneck is the inaccurate parsing and representation of participants' schedules. This issue propagates errors throughout the entire reasoning process.\n*   **Robustness in Schedule Format Handling:** The system lacks robustness in handling variations in the schedule format, such as individual vs. combined schedules. This inflexibility leads to parsing failures and incorrect reasoning.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of Schedule Data:** A recurring error pattern is the misinterpretation of the schedule data, leading to an incorrect assessment of participant availability.\n*   **Incomplete Constraint Application:** The system often misses or incompletely applies constraints when proposing solutions.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling for Parsing Failures:** When parsing fails, the system sometimes proceeds with assumptions that are not grounded in the provided data (Sample 1), rather than explicitly flagging the parsing error and requesting clarification.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **fragile and inaccurate parsing of participant schedules**. This manifests in misinterpreting individual schedules, struggling with combined schedule formats, and failing to account for all constraints during the schedule extraction. This issue underpins most of the observed errors.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Extraction (Schedule Parsing):** Improve the system's ability to reliably extract and represent schedule data from the input text, regardless of the format (individual vs. combined).\n*   **Solution Verification:** Enhance the system's solution verification process to ensure that proposed meeting times strictly adhere to all the defined constraints and preferences.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement better error handling for parsing failures. The system should identify parsing errors and either request clarification or gracefully handle the missing information instead of making unfounded assumptions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Schedule Parsing:** Instead of using brittle regex-based parsing, leverage LLMs for information extraction. Train the LLM to extract schedules from natural language descriptions. For example, use prompts like:\n    `Extract the schedule of [Participant Name] on [Day of the Week] as a list of (start_time, end_time) tuples. If the participant is free all day, return an empty list.`\n2.  **Develop a Standardized Schedule Representation:** Create a standardized data structure to represent participant schedules internally (e.g., a dictionary with participant names as keys and lists of (start_time, end_time, day) tuples as values). Ensure that parsed schedules are consistently converted to this format.\n3.  **Implement Constraint-Based Solution Verification:** Before proposing a solution, explicitly verify it against each constraint. For each participant and proposed time slot, check that the time slot does not overlap with any blocked times in their schedule.\n4.  **Refine the Error Handling Mechanism:** When schedule parsing fails, the system should explicitly state that it is unable to determine the schedule and request more information or explore alternative approaches that don't rely on precise schedule information.\n5.  **Use LLM to Identify Potential Ambiguities:** Use an LLM to identify potential ambiguities in the initial problem description (e.g. \"Are the given schedules complete?\"). If ambiguities are detected, prompt the user to clarify.\n6. **Use an LLM to Convert all Schedules to a Standardized Format:** Prompt the LLM to rewrite schedules so that they are explicitly stated. For example, if a schedule states what a participant is busy, prompt the LLM to rewrite the schedule to state when a participant is available.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 1:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample 2:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 3:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 4:** information\\_extraction\n",

The system has the potential to be effective with targeted improvements.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The system's ability to identify constraints such as participant availability, work hours, and preferences is a key strength.

For example, in Sample 3, it correctly identifies the preferences for each participant and attempts to find a solution based on these.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Schedule Extraction Errors:** The system frequently fails to correctly extract and interpret the existing schedules of participants. This leads to inaccurate assessment of availability and, consequently, incorrect solution generation. (Samples 1, 2, 4)\n*   **Inability to Handle Combined Schedules:** In several instances, the system struggles with the format of the provided schedule, particularly when it is given as a combined schedule for all participants. This is evident in sample 2, where it misinterprets the format of the provided schedule, leading to an incorrect analysis of available times.\n*   **Solution Verification Incompleteness:** The system sometimes proposes solutions that do not fully align with all the stated constraints, indicating a failure in solution verification. For example, in Sample 1, the system proposes a solution without fully accounting for Jennifer's blocked schedule.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Schedule Parsing and Representation:** The most critical bottleneck is the inaccurate parsing and representation of participants' schedules. This issue propagates errors throughout the entire reasoning process.\n*   **Robustness in Schedule Format Handling:** The system lacks robustness in handling variations in the schedule format, such as individual vs. combined schedules. This inflexibility leads to parsing failures and incorrect reasoning.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of Schedule Data:** A recurring error pattern is the misinterpretation of the schedule data, leading to an incorrect assessment of participant availability.\n*   **Incomplete Constraint Application:** The system often misses or incompletely applies constraints when proposing solutions.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling for Parsing Failures:** When parsing fails, the system sometimes proceeds with assumptions that are not grounded in the provided data (Sample 1), rather than explicitly flagging the parsing error and requesting clarification.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **fragile and inaccurate parsing of participant schedules**. This manifests in misinterpreting individual schedules, struggling with combined schedule formats, and failing to account for all constraints during the schedule extraction. This issue underpins most of the observed errors.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Extraction (Schedule Parsing):** Improve the system's ability to reliably extract and represent schedule data from the input text, regardless of the format (individual vs. combined).\n*   **Solution Verification:** Enhance the system's solution verification process to ensure that proposed meeting times strictly adhere to all the defined constraints and preferences.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement better error handling for parsing failures. The system should identify parsing errors and either request clarification or gracefully handle the missing information instead of making unfounded assumptions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Schedule Parsing:** Instead of using brittle regex-based parsing, leverage LLMs for information extraction. Train the LLM to extract schedules from natural language descriptions. For example, use prompts like:\n    `Extract the schedule of [Participant Name] on [Day of the Week] as a list of (start_time, end_time) tuples. If the participant is free all day, return an empty list.`\n2.  **Develop a Standardized Schedule Representation:** Create a standardized data structure to represent participant schedules internally (e.g., a dictionary with participant names as keys and lists of (start_time, end_time, day) tuples as values). Ensure that parsed schedules are consistently converted to this format.\n3.  **Implement Constraint-Based Solution Verification:** Before proposing a solution, explicitly verify it against each constraint. For each participant and proposed time slot, check that the time slot does not overlap with any blocked times in their schedule.\n4.  **Refine the Error Handling Mechanism:** When schedule parsing fails, the system should explicitly state that it is unable to determine the schedule and request more information or explore alternative approaches that don't rely on precise schedule information.\n5.  **Use LLM to Identify Potential Ambiguities:** Use an LLM to identify potential ambiguities in the initial problem description (e.g. \"Are the given schedules complete?\"). If ambiguities are detected, prompt the user to clarify.\n6. **Use an LLM to Convert all Schedules to a Standardized Format:** Prompt the LLM to rewrite schedules so that they are explicitly stated. For example, if a schedule states what a participant is busy, prompt the LLM to rewrite the schedule to state when a participant is available.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 1:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample 2:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 3:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 4:** information\\_extraction\n",

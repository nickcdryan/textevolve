  "approach_summary": "The script uses a hierarchical approach with LLM-driven pattern identification, grid manipulation planning, and execution, each with validation steps. It employs three distinct agent roles: a pattern recognition expert, a planner, and an execution engine. The main function orchestrates the process, calling `identify_pattern` to discern transformation rules, `create_manipulation_plan` to formulate a plan, and `execute_transformation` to apply the plan, using `call_llm` to interact with the LLM for each step. The overall workflow involves identifying patterns, creating manipulation plans based on those patterns, and then executing those plans to transform the grid, with validation occurring at each stage to ensure accuracy.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe error messages are consistently \"Error: Pattern identification failed - Pattern not clearly identified.\" This isn't a runtime error in the traditional sense (like JSONDecodeError or TypeError). It indicates a failure in the *reasoning* process to identify and apply a pattern. This suggests a fundamental flaw in the pattern recognition algorithm or its implementation. There are no technical errors present like JSONDecodeError or TypeErrors.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** The system attempts to address complex transformation tasks, indicating an ability to recognize the high-level structure of the problem.\n2.  **Error Reporting:** The system explicitly reports when it cannot identify a pattern, rather than producing a random or incorrect answer silently. This is helpful for debugging.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Pattern Identification:** The system demonstrably fails to identify the underlying pattern in the grid transformations, leading to consistent errors. This is a major bottleneck.\n2.  **Abstraction and Generalization:** The system cannot generalize from the training examples to the test input. The patterns seem beyond its current capabilities.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** The core algorithm designed to identify patterns in the grid transformations is fundamentally flawed or insufficient for the complexity of the patterns presented.\n2.  **Feature Extraction:** The system is likely unable to extract the relevant features from the input grids that are necessary to discern the transformation pattern.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary recurring pattern is the consistent failure to identify the pattern. This indicates a systemic problem with the pattern recognition logic. The patterns in the \"golden answers\" suggest a kind of cyclic shifting and mirroring of values based on the input grid.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inability to identify the underlying mathematical or logical transformation pattern between input and output grids**. This is not a simple error but a core deficiency in the system's reasoning capabilities for this specific type of problem. The model consistently flags this as \"Pattern identification failed\".\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition Module:** This module needs a complete overhaul. Consider incorporating techniques like:\n    *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**  CNNs are designed for pattern recognition in images and grids.\n    *   **Symbolic Regression:** This technique can find mathematical equations that describe the relationship between input and output.\n    *   **Feature Engineering:**  Manually or automatically extract features that describe the grid (e.g., count of each number, relative positions of numbers, symmetry properties).\n2.  **Representation Learning:** Investigate whether the system's current representation of the grids (likely a simple array) is suitable for pattern recognition.  Consider more abstract representations that capture relationships between elements.\n3.  **Few-Shot Learning:** Explore meta-learning techniques (few-shot learning) so that the system can learn the pattern from a small set of examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Feature Engineering:** Before feeding the grid into any pattern recognition algorithm, extract features like:\n    *   Counts of each unique number in the grid.\n    *   Locations (coordinates) of each unique number.\n    *   Distances between specific numbers.\n    *   Symmetry properties (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).\n    *   Calculate differences between corresponding elements in input and output grids.\n2.  **Test Different Pattern Recognition Models:**  Evaluate CNNs, symbolic regression, and other algorithms on a dataset of similar grid transformation problems.  Start with simpler patterns and gradually increase complexity.\n3.  **Debugging Print Statements:** Add extensive print statements at each stage of the pattern recognition pipeline: input grid, extracted features, intermediate calculations, and the final predicted transformation. This will allow detailed tracing of the system's reasoning and pinpointing the exact location of the error.\n4.  **Implement Unit Tests:** Develop unit tests that specifically target the pattern recognition module. These tests should cover a wide range of possible patterns and edge cases.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n*   **Sample 2:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample outputs, and previous improvement suggestions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### ## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs are strikingly consistent. In all three samples, the system fails to identify the pattern and returns the same error message: \"Error: Pattern identification failed - Pattern not clearly identified.\" This uniformity highlights a systematic issue rather than isolated incidents. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest a structured output format, which is good, but the content within is always the same error. This shows the system *attempts* to follow the output protocol but consistently fails to produce a valid answer. The 'information_extraction, solution_generation' capability mapping doesn't translate to functional execution.\n\n### ## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates very limited capabilities in its current state. While it can decompose the problem into information extraction and solution generation (as indicated in the capability mapping), it's fundamentally unable to perform the core task of pattern recognition required for solving grid transformation problems. The consistent error messages show that the system *detects* the failure but can't recover or provide a solution. The system appears to be essentially non-functional for this specific task.\n\n### ## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Error Reporting:** The system provides a clear and consistent error message when it fails. This is valuable for debugging and monitoring. It's better than returning a random or incorrect answer silently.\n*   **Problem Decomposition (Potential):** The *attempt* to engage in information extraction and solution generation *if successful* demonstrates the potential to handle complex tasks. However, this is unrealized due to the core pattern recognition failure.\n\n### ## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition Failure:** This is the most critical weakness. The system consistently fails to identify the underlying patterns in the grid transformations.\n*   **Lack of Generalization:** The system cannot generalize from any potential training data (not shown, but assumed to exist) to novel input grids.\n*   **No Functional Output:** The consistent \"Pattern identification failed\" means the system produces no useful output.\n\n### ## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe **Pattern Recognition Module** requires the most urgent attention. All other potential capabilities are blocked by this fundamental failure. Without a functioning pattern recognition component, the system is essentially useless for solving grid transformation problems.\n\n### ## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the previous improvement suggestions and the execution analysis, here's a refined set of actionable recommendations:\n\n1.  **Prioritized Implementation: Feature Engineering & CNN Integration (Iteration 1):**\n    *   **Implement Feature Engineering Pipeline:**  Focus on creating a robust feature extraction pipeline FIRST.  The specific features to extract should include:\n        *   Counts of unique numbers.\n        *   Location coordinates of each number.\n        *   Symmetry detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).\n        *   Differences between input and (potential) output grid elements based on position.\n    *   **Integrate a Simple CNN:**  After feature engineering, integrate a basic CNN architecture.  Start with a small CNN with a few convolutional layers, pooling layers, and a fully connected layer for classification.  The output should be a predicted transformation rule (e.g., \"rotate clockwise,\" \"mirror horizontally,\" \"add 1 to all elements\").\n\n2.  **Data-Driven Approach: Create a Testing Dataset & Evaluation Metrics (Iteration 1):**\n    *   **Curate a Dataset:**  Create a dataset of at least 50-100 grid transformation examples with clearly defined patterns.  Categorize the patterns (e.g., rotation, mirroring, addition, subtraction, cyclic shifts).\n    *   **Define Evaluation Metrics:** Establish clear evaluation metrics beyond just \"accuracy.\"  Consider metrics like:\n        *   **Pattern Identification Accuracy:** Did the system correctly identify the type of pattern?\n        *   **Solution Accuracy:**  Did the system generate the correct output grid?\n\n3.  **Debugging & Monitoring Improvements (Iteration 1):**\n    *   **Enhance Logging:**  Implement detailed logging at each stage of the feature extraction and CNN processing pipeline. Log the extracted features, the CNN's internal representations, and the predicted transformation rule.\n    *   **Introduce a Confidence Score:**  Have the system output a confidence score along with its predicted transformation rule.  This will help identify cases where the system is making guesses.\n\n4. **Iterative Refinement: Based on Performance (Iteration 2):**\n    *   **Analyze Error Cases:** After the first iteration, analyze the error cases to identify the types of patterns the system is still struggling with.\n    *   **Refine Feature Engineering:** Based on the error analysis, add or modify the features extracted to better capture the patterns the system is missing.\n    *   **Experiment with Different CNN Architectures:** Explore different CNN architectures (e.g., deeper networks, residual connections) to improve pattern recognition accuracy.\n\n### ## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system currently exhibits a **stable but critically low** capability level. It consistently fails, indicating no improvement over time. The trend will remain flat until significant changes are implemented in the pattern recognition module. The recommended actions are designed to initiate an upward trend.\n",

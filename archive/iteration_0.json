  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first using the `extract_meeting_details` function with the `call_llm` function to extract key information like participants, duration, and schedules from the input question using few-shot learning. Then, `generate_meeting_times` generates all possible meeting times and `filter_available_times` filters these times based on participant schedules, resulting in a proposed meeting time or a \"no solution\" message. The overall workflow involves information extraction via LLM, time generation, schedule filtering, and solution presentation using the `main` function to coordinate.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error observed across all provided error cases is:\n\n*   **JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)**\n\nThis error indicates that the system's output is not a valid JSON string, leading to parsing failures. This suggests a fundamental problem with how the system formats its responses. The LLM is failing to produce proper JSON objects, possibly due to incorrect prompting or formatting instructions.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the provided data (which is limited to error cases), it's difficult to pinpoint specific strengths. However, we can infer potential strengths:\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding:** The system likely *understands* the problem, as evidenced by the complex scheduling constraints described in the questions. The system needs to be able to parse the constraints from the string to work.\n2.  **Constraint Identification:** The system is designed to handle multiple constraints related to time, participant availability, and preferences, suggesting an awareness of constraint-based problem-solving.\n3.  **Solution Attempt:** The system is trying to output JSON, which shows an attempt to provide structured output that can be parsed and acted upon.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Output Formatting:** The most glaring weakness is the consistent failure to produce valid JSON output. This is critical, as it prevents further processing of the LLM's response.\n2.  **Error Handling:** The error messages are generic and do not provide specific information about the cause of the JSON formatting failure, hindering debugging. The traceback is not available and could be useful.\n3.  **Robustness:** The system appears brittle and prone to failure. Even slight deviations from the expected input or prompt format can trigger errors.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Control:** The primary bottleneck is the inability to reliably control the LLM's output format. It is consistently failing to generate valid JSON, rendering the entire system unusable.\n2.  **Lack of Verification:** There's no apparent verification step to check whether the LLM's generated output is valid JSON *before* attempting to parse it.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Consistent JSON Formatting Errors:** The `JSONDecodeError` is a recurring pattern, indicating a systemic issue with output generation. It happens every time.\n*   **Absence of Specific Error Messages:** The error messages are generic, lacking context and specific information about *why* the JSON formatting failed.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **unreliable generation of valid JSON output by the LLM**. This single issue prevents the system from functioning correctly, as all subsequent processing steps rely on a parsable JSON response. This is also related to how the system is set up in terms of the prompt and output format.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Formatting:** Implement stricter prompt engineering techniques to guide the LLM to produce valid JSON.\n2.  **Output Verification:** Add a verification step to check if the LLM's output is valid JSON *before* attempting to parse it.\n3.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Improve error handling to provide more specific and informative error messages, including potential root causes and debug information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Prompt Engineering:**\n    *   **Use Few-Shot Examples:** Provide multiple examples of the expected JSON output format *within the prompt itself*. Include examples with varying complexities.\n    *   **Explicit Formatting Instructions:** Include very clear and explicit instructions in the prompt regarding the required JSON structure. For example: \"Your response *must* be a valid JSON object with the following structure: `{...}`\".\n    *   **System Prompt:** Utilize a system prompt to set the LLM's role as a \"JSON output specialist\" or \"structured data generator.\"\n2.  **Output Verification:**\n    *   **Implement a `validate_json()` function:** This function should take the LLM's output as input and attempt to parse it as JSON. If parsing fails, it should return `False` and an error message.\n    *   **Add a Verification Loop:** Wrap the LLM call and JSON parsing in a loop with a maximum number of retries. If `validate_json()` returns `False`, re-prompt the LLM with the error message and ask it to correct its output.\n3.  **Error Handling and Logging:**\n    *   **Catch `JSONDecodeError`:** Specifically catch the `JSONDecodeError` exception and log detailed information about the error, including the raw LLM output.\n    *   **Provide Contextual Error Messages:** When a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, include the relevant parts of the prompt in the error message to help diagnose the issue.\n    *   **Implement Logging:** Log all LLM calls, prompts, and responses to facilitate debugging and analysis.\n4.  **Consider using a dedicated JSON generation library:**\n    *  Explore tools or libraries designed to enforce JSON schema and automatically generate valid JSON from structured data. This could reduce the burden on the LLM for formatting.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nFor all samples (0-4), the following capabilities failed:\n\n*   **solution_generation:** The system failed to generate a valid solution due to the JSON formatting error.\n*   **solution_verification:** The system could not verify the generated solution because it failed to generate a valid JSON response.\n*   **decision_making:** The system could not make a final decision because it could not generate a parsable solution to begin with.\n*   **information_extraction**: LLM cannot output valid JSON, even if it successfully extracts the information.\n*   **constraint_handling**: LLM cannot output valid JSON, even if it successfully handles constraints.\n",

    "capability_report": {
      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe raw execution outputs confirm the consistent `JSONDecodeError`. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest a deliberate attempt to isolate the LLM's response, but the content between them is invariably an error message, indicating the JSON parsing consistently fails.  The repetition of this error across all samples points to a fundamental flaw in the output generation process, rather than an issue with specific inputs. The fact that there's no actual solution content provided in any of the outputs is further confirmation of the severity of the issue.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nCurrently, the system's capabilities are essentially non-existent. While it may possess some understanding of the problem and the constraints, its inability to produce valid, parsable output renders it completely ineffective.  It's more accurate to say the system *attempts* certain capabilities but fails to execute them successfully.  It demonstrates understanding of what the output *should* be (JSON format), but lacks the ability to reliably *generate* it.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Conceptual Understanding of Constraints:** The system seems to be *designed* to handle complex constraints, hinting at potential strengths in problem decomposition and logical reasoning, *if* the output formatting issues are resolved. We are assuming that the system understands the underlying constraints present in the question to output the answer in JSON format.\n*   **Intent for Structured Output:** The system's attempt to produce JSON suggests an understanding of the need for structured data, which is a positive starting point.\n*   **Clear Markers:** The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest that there is an attempt to isolate the answer from the rest of the output, and if the correct JSON output would be between these tags, this is a good practice to continue.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Unreliable JSON Output:** This is the dominant weakness. The inability to generate valid JSON output completely cripples the system.\n*   **Lack of Error Recovery:** The system doesn't attempt to recover from the `JSONDecodeError`. It simply returns the error, indicating a lack of robustness.\n*   **Insufficient Prompt Control:** The prompts aren't effectively guiding the LLM to produce the desired JSON structure.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Reliable JSON Output Generation**.  Without this, all other potential capabilities are irrelevant. This can be achieved through better **LLM Output Control**.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere's a prioritized list of specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust JSON Validation and Correction Loop:** This is paramount.\n    *   **`validate_json(output)` Function:** Create a function that attempts to parse the LLM output as JSON. It should return `True` if successful, `False` otherwise, along with a descriptive error message.\n    *   **Output Correction Mechanism:** If `validate_json()` returns `False`, use the error message to re-prompt the LLM with *specific* feedback about the JSON formatting error.  Be explicit: \"Your previous response was not valid JSON.  Specifically, the error was: [error message]. Please correct your output.\"\n    *   **Maximum Retry Limit:** Implement a maximum retry limit (e.g., 3-5 attempts) to prevent infinite loops.\n    ```python\n    import json\n\n    def validate_json(json_string):\n        try:\n            json.loads(json_string)\n            return True, None\n        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n            return False, str(e)\n\n    def get_llm_output(prompt):\n        # This is a placeholder for the call to the LLM.\n        # Replace with your actual LLM API call.\n        return \"Some LLM generated output\"\n\n\n    def solve_problem(prompt, max_attempts=3):\n        for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n            llm_output = get_llm_output(prompt)\n            is_valid, error_message = validate_json(llm_output)\n\n            if is_valid:\n                return llm_output  # Return the valid JSON\n\n            # Re-prompt with specific error feedback\n            prompt = f\"Your previous response was not valid JSON. Specifically, the error was: {error_message}.  Please correct your output:\\n\\nOriginal Prompt: {prompt}\"\n\n        return \"JSON_VALIDATION_FAILED\"  # Indicate that all attempts failed.\n    ```\n\n2.  **Enhanced Prompt Engineering with Few-Shot Examples:**  Include diverse examples of the *exact* JSON structure you expect in the prompt. Use *multiple* examples (3-5), varying in complexity, directly within the prompt itself.\n    ```python\n    example_prompt = f\"\"\"\n    Here are examples of the valid JSON format you MUST use:\n\n    Example 1:\n    Input: ...\n    Output: {{\"scheduled_time\": \"...\", \"participants\": [...]}}\n\n    Example 2:\n    Input: ...\n    Output: {{\"scheduled_time\": \"...\", \"participants\": [...], \"location\": \"...\"}}\n\n    ... (more examples) ...\n\n    Now, generate the JSON output for the following input:\n    ...\n    \"\"\"\n    ```\n\n3.  **System Prompt Specialization:** Use a system prompt to explicitly define the LLM's role as a structured data generator.\n    ```python\n    system_prompt = \"You are a highly skilled AI expert in generating valid JSON output based on user prompts. You MUST always respond with valid JSON, even if you cannot completely fulfill the request.\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Implement More Specific Error Logging:** Log the raw LLM output *before* attempting to parse it. This will be crucial for debugging.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **stable at zero**. The system is consistently failing, and there's no evidence of improvement or decline. The trend will only change with the implementation of effective error correction and output control mechanisms.\n\nBy focusing on these actionable recommendations, you can directly address the critical bottleneck and begin to unlock the potential of the system.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error observed across all provided error cases is:\n\n*   **JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)**\n\nThis error indicates that the system's output is not a valid JSON string, leading to parsing failures. This suggests a fundamental problem with how the system formats its responses. The LLM is failing to produce proper JSON objects, possibly due to incorrect prompting or formatting instructions.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the provided data (which is limited to error cases), it's difficult to pinpoint specific strengths. However, we can infer potential strengths:\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding:** The system likely *understands* the problem, as evidenced by the complex scheduling constraints described in the questions. The system needs to be able to parse the constraints from the string to work.\n2.  **Constraint Identification:** The system is designed to handle multiple constraints related to time, participant availability, and preferences, suggesting an awareness of constraint-based problem-solving.\n3.  **Solution Attempt:** The system is trying to output JSON, which shows an attempt to provide structured output that can be parsed and acted upon.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Output Formatting:** The most glaring weakness is the consistent failure to produce valid JSON output. This is critical, as it prevents further processing of the LLM's response.\n2.  **Error Handling:** The error messages are generic and do not provide specific information about the cause of the JSON formatting failure, hindering debugging. The traceback is not available and could be useful.\n3.  **Robustness:** The system appears brittle and prone to failure. Even slight deviations from the expected input or prompt format can trigger errors.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Control:** The primary bottleneck is the inability to reliably control the LLM's output format. It is consistently failing to generate valid JSON, rendering the entire system unusable.\n2.  **Lack of Verification:** There's no apparent verification step to check whether the LLM's generated output is valid JSON *before* attempting to parse it.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Consistent JSON Formatting Errors:** The `JSONDecodeError` is a recurring pattern, indicating a systemic issue with output generation. It happens every time.\n*   **Absence of Specific Error Messages:** The error messages are generic, lacking context and specific information about *why* the JSON formatting failed.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **unreliable generation of valid JSON output by the LLM**. This single issue prevents the system from functioning correctly, as all subsequent processing steps rely on a parsable JSON response. This is also related to how the system is set up in terms of the prompt and output format.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Formatting:** Implement stricter prompt engineering techniques to guide the LLM to produce valid JSON.\n2.  **Output Verification:** Add a verification step to check if the LLM's output is valid JSON *before* attempting to parse it.\n3.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Improve error handling to provide more specific and informative error messages, including potential root causes and debug information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Prompt Engineering:**\n    *   **Use Few-Shot Examples:** Provide multiple examples of the expected JSON output format *within the prompt itself*. Include examples with varying complexities.\n    *   **Explicit Formatting Instructions:** Include very clear and explicit instructions in the prompt regarding the required JSON structure. For example: \"Your response *must* be a valid JSON object with the following structure: `{...}`\".\n    *   **System Prompt:** Utilize a system prompt to set the LLM's role as a \"JSON output specialist\" or \"structured data generator.\"\n2.  **Output Verification:**\n    *   **Implement a `validate_json()` function:** This function should take the LLM's output as input and attempt to parse it as JSON. If parsing fails, it should return `False` and an error message.\n    *   **Add a Verification Loop:** Wrap the LLM call and JSON parsing in a loop with a maximum number of retries. If `validate_json()` returns `False`, re-prompt the LLM with the error message and ask it to correct its output.\n3.  **Error Handling and Logging:**\n    *   **Catch `JSONDecodeError`:** Specifically catch the `JSONDecodeError` exception and log detailed information about the error, including the raw LLM output.\n    *   **Provide Contextual Error Messages:** When a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, include the relevant parts of the prompt in the error message to help diagnose the issue.\n    *   **Implement Logging:** Log all LLM calls, prompts, and responses to facilitate debugging and analysis.\n4.  **Consider using a dedicated JSON generation library:**\n    *  Explore tools or libraries designed to enforce JSON schema and automatically generate valid JSON from structured data. This could reduce the burden on the LLM for formatting.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nFor all samples (0-4), the following capabilities failed:\n\n*   **solution_generation:** The system failed to generate a valid solution due to the JSON formatting error.\n*   **solution_verification:** The system could not verify the generated solution because it failed to generate a valid JSON response.\n*   **decision_making:** The system could not make a final decision because it could not generate a parsable solution to begin with.\n*   **information_extraction**: LLM cannot output valid JSON, even if it successfully extracts the information.\n*   **constraint_handling**: LLM cannot output valid JSON, even if it successfully handles constraints.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe raw execution outputs confirm the consistent `JSONDecodeError`. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest a deliberate attempt to isolate the LLM's response, but the content between them is invariably an error message, indicating the JSON parsing consistently fails.  The repetition of this error across all samples points to a fundamental flaw in the output generation process, rather than an issue with specific inputs. The fact that there's no actual solution content provided in any of the outputs is further confirmation of the severity of the issue.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nCurrently, the system's capabilities are essentially non-existent. While it may possess some understanding of the problem and the constraints, its inability to produce valid, parsable output renders it completely ineffective.  It's more accurate to say the system *attempts* certain capabilities but fails to execute them successfully.  It demonstrates understanding of what the output *should* be (JSON format), but lacks the ability to reliably *generate* it.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Conceptual Understanding of Constraints:** The system seems to be *designed* to handle complex constraints, hinting at potential strengths in problem decomposition and logical reasoning, *if* the output formatting issues are resolved. We are assuming that the system understands the underlying constraints present in the question to output the answer in JSON format.\n*   **Intent for Structured Output:** The system's attempt to produce JSON suggests an understanding of the need for structured data, which is a positive starting point.\n*   **Clear Markers:** The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest that there is an attempt to isolate the answer from the rest of the output, and if the correct JSON output would be between these tags, this is a good practice to continue.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Unreliable JSON Output:** This is the dominant weakness. The inability to generate valid JSON output completely cripples the system.\n*   **Lack of Error Recovery:** The system doesn't attempt to recover from the `JSONDecodeError`. It simply returns the error, indicating a lack of robustness.\n*   **Insufficient Prompt Control:** The prompts aren't effectively guiding the LLM to produce the desired JSON structure.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Reliable JSON Output Generation**.

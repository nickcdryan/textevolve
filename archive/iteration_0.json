  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to answer factual questions through iterative refinement, incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning and validation. The problem is decomposed into generating a search query, simulating information retrieval, extracting an answer with a confidence score, and validating the extracted answer. The agent roles involved are a search query generator, a question answering expert, and an answer validator. The script defines a `call_llm` function, which is used to call the Gemini LLM with different prompts, and a `main` function that orchestrates the entire process by calling `call_llm` multiple times to generate search queries, extract answers, and perform validation. The overall workflow is: question -> search query generation -> simulated information retrieval -> answer extraction -> validation -> final answer.",

The system consistently returns \"Could not be validated.\" indicating a failure in the validation step or an inability to find a valid answer based on its information retrieval or reasoning process.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nSince there are no success cases provided, it's impossible to definitively state the system's strengths. However, we can infer:\n\n1. **Error Handling:** The system doesn't crash; it gracefully returns \"Could not be validated\" when it encounters a problem.\n2. **Output Formatting:** The system correctly uses the ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END tags. This suggests a structured output approach.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1. **Validation Failure:** The system consistently fails to validate a suitable answer, resulting in \"Could not be validated.\" This points towards a core problem in either finding the answer, understanding the question, or validating the retrieved information.\n2. **Lack of Explanation:** The system provides no insight into why validation failed. This hinders debugging and improvement efforts. The 'explanation' field in the error cases is simply a restatement that the system's answer is wrong.\n3. **Information Retrieval/Extraction:** The inability to find the correct answer suggests a potential problem in effectively searching and extracting information relevant to answering the specific questions.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1. **Answer Validation/Verification Logic:** The primary bottleneck is the validation process, which incorrectly flags potentially correct answers as invalid or fails to identify the correct answer altogether.\n2. **Question Understanding and Information Retrieval:** The system's ability to understand the nuances of the question and retrieve relevant information is insufficient, leading to a lack of candidate answers for the validation stage.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe dominant error pattern is the consistent \"Could not be validated\" response, regardless of the question's content or complexity. This implies a systemic issue in the core answer-finding or validation process, and it suggests that either it fails to extract relevant information, the logic for validation is not correct, or, more specifically, a threshold for confidence is too high.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **overly strict or flawed validation process.** The system rejects potentially correct answers, leading to a \"Could not be validated\" response even when a valid answer exists. This is likely due to a high confidence threshold for what constitutes a valid answer, incorrect logic in comparing retrieved information with the question's requirements, or an incomplete knowledge base.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1. **Validation Logic:** The validation module needs a thorough overhaul. It should be less strict, more flexible in handling different answer formats, and capable of handling potential paraphrasing.\n2. **Information Retrieval and Extraction:** Enhance the system's capability to retrieve and extract precise, relevant information to the questions. This might involve refining search queries, improving text parsing algorithms, or expanding the knowledge base.\n3. **Confidence Scoring and Thresholding:** Implement a more sophisticated confidence scoring mechanism and adjust the validation threshold to allow for answers with slightly lower but potentially still correct confidence scores. It could also be helpful to provide the confidence scores along with the \"Could not be validated\" message so that future iterations can be tracked more efficiently.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Implement a Confidence Score:** Assign a confidence score to each potential answer based on the relevance and reliability of the source information and the level of matching with the question.\n2. **Relax Validation Threshold:** Lower the confidence threshold required for an answer to be considered valid. Experiment with different thresholds to find a balance between accuracy and recall.\n3. **Improve Question Understanding:** Use techniques like semantic parsing and question classification to better understand the question's intent and constraints.\n4. **Implement Intermediate Output Logging:** Log intermediate steps of the reasoning process, including the retrieved information, extracted entities, and confidence scores, to better understand why validation fails. Print statements should be used here.\n5. **Finetune Information Retrieval:** Improve search queries and information extraction techniques to retrieve more relevant information for each question.\n6. **Implement Paraphrasing and Synonym Handling:** Enable the system to recognize paraphrases and synonyms to improve matching between retrieved information and the question.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

The system returns \"Could not be validated\" enclosed in the correct `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags in all cases. This indicates a systemic problem that prevents the AI from identifying a valid answer. The uniformity of the error suggests the issue lies in a fundamental aspect of the process, likely the validation stage itself. The system might be failing to extract relevant information from its knowledge base, generate plausible answers, or, crucially, verify the correctness of any generated answer.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently exhibits virtually no demonstrated capabilities related to answering questions accurately. While it shows a basic capacity for output formatting and error handling (returning a consistent error message rather than crashing), it fails entirely in its primary objective of information retrieval, answer generation, and validation.  The observed output suggests a possible capability to initiate an answer string and terminate it, which means there is at least a structure in place.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Consistent Error Handling:** The system gracefully handles errors by returning \"Could not be validated\" instead of crashing, demonstrating basic error management.\n*   **Structured Output:** The correct usage of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` suggests a structured approach to output formatting, indicating a functional output pipeline.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complete Lack of Accuracy:** The system consistently fails to provide a valid answer, rendering it functionally useless.\n*   **Validation Bottleneck:** The \"Could not be validated\" error message strongly points to a critical flaw in the validation or verification process.\n*   **Lack of Explanations:** No justification or reasoning is provided for the failure, hindering debugging and targeted improvements.  The error messages should provide more context.\n*   **Suspect Information Retrieval/Generation:** The validation failure likely stems from an inability to effectively retrieve relevant information or generate plausible answer candidates in the first place.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Answer Validation/Verification Logic**.  Addressing the root cause of the \"Could not be validated\" error is paramount. Without a functional validation process, even accurate information retrieval and answer generation will be rendered useless.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Detailed Logging:** Introduce comprehensive logging at each stage of the process: information retrieval, answer generation, and validation.  Log the retrieved information, candidate answers, confidence scores, and the specific validation criteria being applied. This will provide valuable insights into where the system is failing. Use print statements, or a logging library for structured reporting.\n\n2.  **Examine and Simplify Validation Logic:** Review the validation module to identify any overly strict or flawed validation criteria.  Temporarily disable or simplify the validation logic to test if the system can generate reasonable answer candidates.  Add unit tests to the validation logic to confirm it performs as expected.\n\n3.  **Implement Confidence Scoring:** Introduce a confidence scoring mechanism for candidate answers. The confidence score should reflect the relevance, reliability, and completeness of the answer based on the retrieved information.\n\n4.  **Adjust Validation Threshold (Gradually):** If a confidence scoring mechanism is in place, gradually lower the validation threshold to allow for answers with lower confidence scores. Monitor the impact on accuracy and precision. Don't start making large sweeping changes to the threshold.\n\n5.  **Develop a Test Suite and Diagnostic Reports:** Add an automated testing framework with sample questions and expected answers. Add metrics to track improvements to each capability, and add diagnostic reports to expose the reasons why a capability isn't performing.\n\n6.  **Break Down the Problem:** Focus on the initial stages of retrieval/generation. If the validation logic is sound, then debug those components first.\n\n### CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information_extraction (Failed), solution_generation (Failed), solution_verification (Failed)\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction (Failed), solution_generation (Failed), solution_verification (Failed)\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction (Failed), solution_generation (Failed), solution_verification (Failed)\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable (but at zero)**. The system consistently fails, indicating no progress or improvement. Immediate action is required to address the critical weaknesses.\n",

This suggests a structured output approach.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1. **Validation Failure:** The system consistently fails to validate a suitable answer, resulting in \"Could not be validated.\" This points towards a core problem in either finding the answer, understanding the question, or validating the retrieved information.\n2. **Lack of Explanation:** The system provides no insight into why validation failed. This hinders debugging and improvement efforts. The 'explanation' field in the error cases is simply a restatement that the system's answer is wrong.\n3. **Information Retrieval/Extraction:** The inability to find the correct answer suggests a potential problem in effectively searching and extracting information relevant to answering the specific questions.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1. **Answer Validation/Verification Logic:** The primary bottleneck is the validation process, which incorrectly flags potentially correct answers as invalid or fails to identify the correct answer altogether.\n2. **Question Understanding and Information Retrieval:** The system's ability to understand the nuances of the question and retrieve relevant information is insufficient, leading to a lack of candidate answers for the validation stage.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe dominant error pattern is the consistent \"Could not be validated\" response, regardless of the question's content or complexity. This implies a systemic issue in the core answer-finding or validation process, and it suggests that either it fails to extract relevant information, the logic for validation is not correct, or, more specifically, a threshold for confidence is too high.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **overly strict or flawed validation process.** The system rejects potentially correct answers, leading to a \"Could not be validated\" response even when a valid answer exists. This is likely due to a high confidence threshold for what constitutes a valid answer, incorrect logic in comparing retrieved information with the question's requirements, or an incomplete knowledge base.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1. **Validation Logic:** The validation module needs a thorough overhaul. It should be less strict, more flexible in handling different answer formats, and capable of handling potential paraphrasing.\n2. **Information Retrieval and Extraction:** Enhance the system's capability to retrieve and extract precise, relevant information to the questions. This might involve refining search queries, improving text parsing algorithms, or expanding the knowledge base.\n3. **Confidence Scoring and Thresholding:** Implement a more sophisticated confidence scoring mechanism and adjust the validation threshold to allow for answers with slightly lower but potentially still correct confidence scores. It could also be helpful to provide the confidence scores along with the \"Could not be validated\" message so that future iterations can be tracked more efficiently.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Implement a Confidence Score:** Assign a confidence score to each potential answer based on the relevance and reliability of the source information and the level of matching with the question.\n2. **Relax Validation Threshold:** Lower the confidence threshold required for an answer to be considered valid. Experiment with different thresholds to find a balance between accuracy and recall.\n3. **Improve Question Understanding:** Use techniques like semantic parsing and question classification to better understand the question's intent and constraints.\n4. **Implement Intermediate Output Logging:** Log intermediate steps of the reasoning process, including the retrieved information, extracted entities, and confidence scores, to better understand why validation fails. Print statements should be used here.\n5. **Finetune Information Retrieval:** Improve search queries and information extraction techniques to retrieve more relevant information for each question.\n6. **Implement Paraphrasing and Synonym Handling:** Enable the system to recognize paraphrases and synonyms to improve matching between retrieved information and the question.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**System Name:** AI System (Unnamed)\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**Version:** (Assuming initial version due to lack of performance)\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs demonstrate a consistent and complete failure across all sampled inputs. The system returns \"Could not be validated\" enclosed in the correct `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags in all cases. This indicates a systemic problem that prevents the AI from identifying a valid answer. The uniformity of the error suggests the issue lies in a fundamental aspect of the process, likely the validation stage itself. The system might be failing to extract relevant information from its knowledge base, generate plausible answers, or, crucially, verify the correctness of any generated answer.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently exhibits virtually no demonstrated capabilities related to answering questions accurately. While it shows a basic capacity for output formatting and error handling (returning a consistent error message rather than crashing), it fails entirely in its primary objective of information retrieval, answer generation, and validation.  The observed output suggests a possible capability to initiate an answer string and terminate it, which means there is at least a structure in place.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Consistent Error Handling:** The system gracefully handles errors by returning \"Could not be validated\" instead of crashing, demonstrating basic error management.\n*   **Structured Output:** The correct usage of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` suggests a structured approach to output formatting, indicating a functional output pipeline.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complete Lack of Accuracy:** The system consistently fails to provide a valid answer, rendering it functionally useless.\n*   **Validation Bottleneck:** The \"Could not be validated\" error message strongly points to a critical flaw in the validation or verification process.\n*   **Lack of Explanations:** No justification or reasoning is provided for the failure, hindering debugging and targeted improvements.  The error messages should provide more context.\n*   **Suspect Information Retrieval/Generation:** The validation failure likely stems from an inability to effectively retrieve relevant information or generate plausible answer candidates in the first place.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Answer Validation/Verification Logic**.  Addressing the root cause of the \"Could not be validated\" error is paramount. Without a functional validation process, even accurate information retrieval and answer generation will be rendered useless.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Detailed Logging:** Introduce comprehensive logging at each stage of the process: information retrieval, answer generation, and validation.  Log the retrieved information, candidate answers, confidence scores, and the specific validation criteria being applied. This will provide valuable insights into where the system is failing. Use print statements, or a logging library for structured reporting.\n\n2.  **Examine and Simplify Validation Logic:** Review the validation module to identify any overly strict or flawed validation criteria.  Temporarily disable or simplify the validation logic to test if the system can generate reasonable answer candidates.  Add unit tests to the validation logic to confirm it performs as expected.\n\n3.  **Implement Confidence Scoring:** Introduce a confidence scoring mechanism for candidate answers. The confidence score should reflect the relevance, reliability, and completeness of the answer based on the retrieved information.\n\n4.  **Adjust Validation Threshold (Gradually):** If a confidence scoring mechanism is in place, gradually lower the validation threshold to allow for answers with lower confidence scores. Monitor the impact on accuracy and precision. Don't start making large sweeping changes to the threshold.\n\n5.  **Develop a Test Suite and Diagnostic Reports:** Add an automated testing framework with sample questions and expected answers. Add metrics to track improvements to each capability, and add diagnostic reports to expose the reasons why a capability isn't performing.\n\n6.  **Break Down the Problem:** Focus on the initial stages of retrieval/generation. If the validation logic is sound, then debug those components first.\n\n### CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information_extraction (Failed), solution_generation (Failed), solution_verification (Failed)\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction (Failed), solution_generation (Failed), solution_verification (Failed)\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction (Failed), solution_generation (Failed), solution_verification (Failed)\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable (but at zero)**. The system consistently fails, indicating no progress or improvement. Immediate action is required to address the critical weaknesses.\n"

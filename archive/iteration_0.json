        "3. **Double-check the test script's import statement:** Confirm that `from current_script_0 import main` is syntactically correct.  There should be no typos or incorrect module paths.",
        "4. **Add a `if __name__ == '__main__':` block (Optional but Recommended):** If the script is intended to be run directly, include this block and call the `main` function within it. This does not directly solve the `ImportError` but improves code structure and prevents unintended execution when imported as a module. However, ensure `main` is still defined so it can be imported.",
        "5. **Review the intended execution flow:** Ensure that `current_script_0.py` is intended to be imported and used as a module. If it's meant to be a standalone script, adjust `test_script_0.py` to execute it directly rather than importing a function from it."

      "root_causes": [
        "1. **Incorrect Script Structure:** The `current_script_0.py` might not be structured as a module with a clearly defined entry point (`main` function).",
        "2. **Missing 'main' Function:** The function that's supposed to handle the scheduling logic might not be named 'main' or might be missing entirely.",
        "3. **Scope Issues:** The 'main' function may be defined within a local scope (e.g., inside another function), making it inaccessible from the test script.",
        "4. **Misunderstanding of Module Import:** The test script might be attempting to import a function from a script that's not designed to be imported as a module."

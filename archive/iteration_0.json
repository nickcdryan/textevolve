  "approach_summary": "This script uses a chain-of-thought approach to schedule meetings by first extracting information (participants, duration, availability) using an LLM, then finding a potential meeting time, and finally verifying the solution, each step employing a dedicated LLM call with a specific system instruction defining its role. The problem is decomposed into information extraction, solution finding, and verification stages, with each stage executed by an LLM agent. The workflow involves sequentially calling these agents to arrive at a valid meeting time.",

This results in incorrect time slot identification, missed preferences, and overall unreliable solution generation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **constraint_handling:** Needs significant improvement to accurately reflect all constraints and preferences in identifying available time slots.\n*   **solution_verification:** The system needs a robust verification step to ensure that the generated solution(s) satisfy *all* constraints before presenting them.\n*   **decision_making:** The system needs a better mechanism to evaluate and prioritize potential solutions based on constraints and preferences, to converge on a single \"best\" answer instead of listing multiple possibilities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **LLM-Driven Constraint Parsing & Structuring:** Instead of relying on fragile string matching, use an LLM call to explicitly extract and structure all constraints and preferences. The LLM can be prompted to output a structured JSON object representing the constraints, with fields for participants, blocked times, preferred times, meeting duration, etc.\n    ```python\n    def extract_constraints(question):\n        prompt = f\"Extract the following information from the text: participants, blocked times for each participant, preferred times for each participant, meeting duration, and allowed days. Return a JSON object. \\n\\n Text: {question}\"\n        constraints_json = call_llm(prompt)\n        return json.loads(constraints_json)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Multi-Agent Constraint Verification:** Implement a \"constraint_verifier_agent\" whose sole purpose is to verify whether a proposed time slot satisfies all constraints. This agent would take the structured constraints (from step 1) and a proposed time slot as input and return a boolean indicating whether the constraints are satisfied. This helps to explicitly separate constraint verification from the solution generation logic.\n    ```python\n    def constraint_verifier_agent(constraints, proposed_time):\n        prompt = f\"Given these constraints: {json.dumps(constraints)}, does the time {proposed_time} satisfy ALL constraints?

This will help to surface errors in constraint application. For example:\n    ```python\n    def evaluate_time_slot(time_slot, constraints):\n        reasoning_steps = [\n            f\"Step 1: Check if {time_slot} conflicts with {constraints['participant1']}'s schedule.\",\n            f\"Step 2: Check if {time_slot} conflicts with {constraints['participant2']}'s schedule.\",\n            f\"Step 3: Check if {time_slot} violates {constraints['participant1']}'s time preferences.\",\n            f\"Step 4: Check if {time_slot} violates {constraints['participant2']}'s time preferences.\",\n            f\"Step 5: Check if {time_slot} is within the allowed days.\"\n        ]\n        reasoning_prompt = \"\\n\".join(reasoning_steps) + f\"\\n\\nDoes {time_slot} satisfy all constraints?

Use an LLM to score each solution based on the degree to which it satisfies preferences.\n    ```python\n    def rank_solutions(solutions, constraints):\n        prompt = f\"Rank these solutions {solutions} based on how well they adhere to the preferences in constraints {constraints}. Give each a score (1-10) and then rank them.\"\n        ranked_solutions = call_llm(prompt)\n        return ranked_solutions #  e.g., \"Solution 1 (Score: 9), Solution 2 (Score: 7)...\"\n    ```\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** constraint_handling, solution_verification, decision_making\n*   **Sample ID 1:** constraint_handling, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 3:** constraint_handling, solution_verification, solution_generation\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a basic capability to extract relevant information and identify potential meeting times based on simple constraints. However, its overall effectiveness is significantly hampered by its inability to accurately handle complex and overlapping constraints, leading to a high error rate and unreliable solution generation. The system's reliance on brittle parsing and lack of a robust solution verification mechanism are major contributing factors to its poor performance.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system can generally extract basic scheduling information, such as participants and time constraints, from the input text. This provides a foundation for further reasoning.\n*   **Attempted Reasoning:** The system attempts to reason about available time slots based on the extracted information, indicating a potential for more complex problem-solving.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system struggles to accurately apply and integrate multiple, diverse constraints related to time preferences, overlapping schedules, and meeting durations.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust mechanism to verify that generated solutions satisfy *all* given constraints before presenting them.\n*   **Decision-Making & Prioritization:** The system often lists multiple potential solutions without effectively narrowing them down to the optimal one, failing to apply preferences for solution prioritization.\n*   **Parsing Brittle**: Fails to determine meeting lengths or deal with slight variations in input phrasing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Constraint Handling:** Improving the system's ability to accurately and reliably handle complex and overlapping constraints is the single most critical capability to focus on. This will directly address the primary issue and unlock significant improvements in overall performance. This encompasses better parsing of constraints, representing them internally, and ensuring they are adhered to in the solution.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Constraint Parsing & Structuring:** Replace brittle string matching with an LLM call to explicitly extract and structure all constraints and preferences into a JSON object. This allows for flexible, accurate, and standardized constraint representation. Focus the prompt on getting specific constraint information (participants, blocked times for each participant, preferred times for each participant, meeting duration, and allowed days) and returning a structured JSON.\n\n2.  **Develop a Multi-Agent Constraint Verification System:** Implement a \"constraint_verifier_agent\" that uses an LLM call to verify whether a proposed time slot satisfies all constraints. This agent should take the structured constraints (from step 1) and a proposed time slot as input and return a simple boolean response (True/False) indicating constraint satisfaction. Using a single boolean output forces the LLM to fully reason about the constraints, simplifying the response and making it easier to use in code.\n\n3.  **Employ Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Time Slot Evaluation:** Integrate a chain-of-thought process within the `evaluate_time_slot` function to thoroughly assess time slot feasibility. The prompt should instruct the LLM to explicitly check each constraint against the candidate time slot, step-by-step, showing its reasoning, before giving a final yes/no verdict. This will expose constraint application errors.\n\n4.  **Refine Solution Ranking with LLM-Based Preference Scoring:** After generating potential solutions, use an LLM call to score each solution based on the degree to which it satisfies participant preferences. The prompt should ask the LLM to consider all provided preferences and assign a score (e.g., 1-10) based on how well the solution aligns with those preferences. This score should then be used to rank the solutions. Ensure that constraints are considered first, and then preferences are used for ranking solutions that satisfy constraints.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are considered **stable but inadequate**. While the system demonstrates basic functionality, its high error rate and limitations in constraint handling prevent it from being reliably useful. Addressing the weaknesses outlined above should lead to a significant upward trend in capabilities. Without focused improvement, the system will likely remain stuck at its current level of performance.\n",

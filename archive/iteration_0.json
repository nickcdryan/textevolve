  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using LLMs to extract information, analyze constraints, generate candidate schedules, and verify/refine the solution. The main function orchestrates the process, which is decomposed into modular functions each responsible for a specific stage in scheduling. Each function assumes an expert agent role, like information extractor or meeting scheduler. The functions used include `main`, `extract_meeting_info`, `analyze_constraints`, `generate_candidate_schedule`, `verify_and_refine`, and `call_llm`, with `main` calling all the others and `call_llm` used by most functions to access the LLM. The overall workflow is sequential, moving from information extraction to schedule generation to verification.",

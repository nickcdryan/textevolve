  "approach_summary": "This script uses a chain-of-thought approach, leveraging LLMs to answer questions by first determining the question type, then extracting relevant information, generating an answer, and finally verifying the answer. Each step uses a specific LLM agent role (e.g., question type classifier, information extractor) defined by system instructions to decompose the problem into manageable parts. The functions used are `main` (orchestrates the workflow), `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, `generate_answer`, `verify_answer` (each leveraging `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini LLM). The overall workflow is sequential, passing the output of each function as input to the next, with error handling at each stage.",

In the second quarter, the Jaguars got on the board with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Colts replied with Manning and Clark hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, Jacksonville tried to come back as QB David Garrard completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Mercedes Lewis for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with Manning completing a 1-yard TD pass to RB Luke Lawton. Afterwards, Jacksonville tried to come back as Garrard completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt (along with getting the 2-point conversion run). Indianapolis' defense managed to seal the deal. With their season-sweep over the Jaguars, the Colts improved to 10-2.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Coming off their easy road win over the Rams, the Vikings went home for a Week 6 inter-conference duel with the Baltimore Ravens. Minnesota got off to a fast start in the first quarter with quarterback Brett Favre completing a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian. Afterwards, the Ravens got the only points of the second quarter as kicker Steven Hauschka getting a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikings picked up where they left off with a 40-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell. Baltimore responded with a 22-yard touchdown run from running back Ray Rice, yet Longwell helped out Minnesota by nailing a 22-yard field goal. Afterwards, an action-packed fourth quarter ensued. Minnesota increased its lead with Favre hooking up with Shiancoe again on a 1-yard touchdown pass, but the Ravens continued to hang around as quarterback Joe Flacco found wide receiver Mark Clayton on a 32-yard touchdown pass. The Vikings replied with Longwell's 29-yard field goal, but Baltimore took lead for the first time in the game as Flacco hooked up with wide receiver Derrick Mason on a 12-yard touchdown pass and Rice running 33 yards for a touchdown. Minnesota then regained the lead as Longwell booted a 31-yard field goal after a 58-yard pass from quarterback Brett Favre to wide receiver Sidney Rice. The Ravens got a last-minute drive into scoring range, but Hauschka's 44-yard field goal attempt went wide left, preserving the Vikings' perfect season. With the win, the Vikings acquired their first 6-0 start since 2003 (unfortunately that team did not make the playoffs).

The system gets stuck in a verification loop, hindering its ability to provide meaningful responses. The system's accuracy of 0.33 and an error rate of 0.66 further underscore the need for significant improvement.\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal a consistent pattern of premature verification without execution. The system identifies the task to be performed (e.g., \"Find the mass of each star and compare them\", \"Identify the player\") and immediately attempts to verify its feasibility *before* attempting to find the relevant information. This leads to outputs like \"Verify that the required information...is known and possible\" and \"Verify that it makes sense to...\". These outputs are essentially the system stating *what it needs to do* rather than *actually doing it*. The \"Verify that 'Brett Favre' is the player...\" output further emphasizes this stalling behavior, suggesting an attempt to confirm a *potential* answer *before* verifying its accuracy from the passage's context.  The complete lack of answers derived directly from the input texts is a critical failure.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\n*   **Strengths (Limited):**\n    *   Partial Information Extraction: Can identify key entities.\n    *   Question Decomposition: Able to break down questions into sub-tasks.\n    *   Context Awareness (Attempted): Acknowledges the need for information verification.\n*   **Weaknesses:**\n    *   Task Execution: Fails to execute identified sub-tasks.\n    *   Answer Generation: Lacks a mechanism for synthesizing information into a definitive answer.\n    *   Decision Making: Poor decision-making logic leads to verification loops and inaction.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS (TO MAINTAIN):**\n\n*   **Information Extraction (Focus on Enhancement):** The system's ability to extract key entities is a foundational strength.

Log the exact data being searched, the data extracted, and any calculations being performed.\n2.  **Prioritize Execution with Post-Execution Verification:** Modify the control flow to prioritize execution over preemptive verification. Only attempt to verify *after* a potential answer has been generated. This approach allows the system to explore potential solutions and only verify the best candidate answer.\n3.  **Remove Pre-Execution Verification:** For the next iteration, remove the \"Verify that...\" logic *entirely*. Force the system to attempt to answer the question directly. This will provide valuable data on whether the extraction and processing steps are functioning correctly, even if the final answer is incorrect.\n4.  **Introduce Answer Extraction Module:** Develop a module that receives the results of task execution and attempts to extract a direct answer from the passage, based on the performed tasks.

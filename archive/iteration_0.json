  "approach_summary": "The script solves the scheduling problem by decomposing it into sub-problems using the `decompose_problem` function, then extracts relevant details with `extract_information` and identifies limitations using `identify_constraints`, all leveraging the LLM. The script uses the LLM to find suitable meeting times in `find_available_time_slots` and format the final answer using the `format_answer` function. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling on the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini API for each step of the workflow.",

This suggests the code execution itself is not crashing, but rather producing logically incorrect results.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** The system appears to be able to identify and incorporate basic constraints related to time availability and preferences. It correctly excludes time slots where participants have existing meetings.\n2.  **Solution Generation:** The system generates a list of candidate time slots that generally adhere to the specified working hours (9:00 to 17:00) and meeting duration (half an hour or one hour).\n3. **Information Extraction:** The system seems to be able to extract the participants, the duration, the time windows and the schedules from the problem description.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Lack of Single Best Solution:** The system consistently returns multiple possible time slots instead of identifying and providing a single, optimal solution as expected by the golden answers. This indicates a failure in decision-making. The instructions clearly state \"Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant\", which the system is not utilizing to narrow down to a single best option.\n2.  **Failure to Heed Preferences:** While the system considers hard constraints (existing schedules), it doesn't consistently prioritize preferences (e.g., \"Harold would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00\"). This suggests inadequate constraint handling related to softer preferences.\n3. **Inconsistent Application of Constraints:** In sample 3, Bobby wants to avoid meetings on Thursday and Friday, and Brandon wants to avoid meetings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesdays before noon. The golden answer suggests a meeting on Wednesday after noon (13:30 - 14:00). However the proposed times by the system are all on Thursday and Friday, which is a clear violation of the constraints specified.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Suboptimal Decision-Making:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to narrow down the list of feasible solutions to a *single*, *best* solution based on given preferences or implicit prioritization rules. This suggests a weak decision-making process.\n2.  **Weak Preference Handling:** The system doesn't effectively translate \"would like to avoid\" preferences into a concrete scoring or filtering mechanism, leading to solutions that violate these soft constraints.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Multiple Solutions Instead of One:** The most prominent recurring pattern is the system's tendency to generate multiple valid solutions when only one is expected, suggesting a lack of a clear selection criterion or a failure to understand the task's requirement for a single, definitive answer.\n2. **Violation of Soft Constraints:** The system often lists solutions that violate the \"would rather not meet\" conditions, indicating insufficient prioritization or incorrect processing of these preference-based constraints.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **lack of a robust decision-making process to select a single, optimal meeting time from the set of feasible options.** The system seems to stop after identifying multiple valid slots without applying any further logic to choose the best one according to the stated preferences and overall constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Decision-Making:** Implement a mechanism to rank or score possible solutions based on a combination of factors, including adherence to preferences, minimizing disruptions to participant schedules, or other implicit prioritization rules.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** Improve the way \"soft\" preferences are handled by incorporating them into the solution ranking/scoring process. For example, assign a penalty score to solutions that violate preferences.\n3. **Consistency in Constraint Application:** Improve the code to make sure that constraints are applied consistently, and that the proposed solution does not violate any of the constraints specified.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a scoring function:** Develop a scoring function that considers both hard constraints (availability) and soft constraints (preferences). Hard constraints should have a much higher weight, effectively eliminating any solution that violates them.\n2.  **Refine the prompt:** Modify the prompt to explicitly instruct the system to provide *only one* best possible time slot, emphasizing the need for a definitive answer. Add explicit instructions on how to handle preferences. For example, \"Prioritize time slots that minimize conflicts with participant preferences.\"\n3. **Add verification step:** Incorporate a solution verification step that explicitly checks whether the selected time slot violates any hard or soft constraints. If violations are found, trigger a re-evaluation or refinement process.\n4.  **Use Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** Implement a chain-of-thought process where the system explicitly explains its reasoning for choosing a particular time slot, making the decision-making process more transparent and easier to debug.\n5.  **Provide more examples:** Include few-shot examples of how soft constraints should be handled in the prompt. Show examples where the \"best\" solution is selected because it avoids a participant's preferred unscheduled time.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** decision\\_making, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample 1:** decision\\_making, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample 2:** decision\\_making, constraint\\_handling\n*   **Sample 3:** solution_generation, constraint_handling, decision_making\n*   **Sample 4:** decision\\_making\n",

Additionally, the provided sample outputs do *not* violate the soft constraints, because outputs are only provided for the first 3 samples.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** Lists multiple time slots across several days. No obvious violation of constraints *within the output*, but the task requirement for a single answer is not met.\n*   **Sample 1:**  Again, lists multiple time slots, all on Monday.  The output itself doesn't reveal a constraint violation, but the core issue of multiple solutions persists.\n*   **Sample 2:** Lists multiple time slots on different days. No constraint violation apparent, but the output fails to provide a *single*, *best* answer.\n\nThe lack of constraint violations within the *provided* execution outputs is misleading.  It *only* means the code isn't producing overtly *impossible* solutions *in those cases*. It *doesn't* mean the constraints are being correctly *prioritized* to yield the *best* solution.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a basic ability to generate feasible meeting times within specified constraints (working hours, duration). However, it *fails* to make a decision and provide a single, optimal solution based on the instructions. Weak handling of soft constraints (preferences) and suboptimal decision-making are critical flaws.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Feasible Solution Generation:** Can generate a list of *possible* meeting times that generally adhere to basic constraints.\n*   **Constraint Inclusion:** The system extracts and considers at least some basic constraints (e.g. time windows).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Suboptimal Decision-Making:** The primary weakness is the *inability* to choose the *single best* solution.\n*   **Weak Preference Handling:** The system doesn't consistently prioritize preferences (e.g., \"Harold would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00\").\n*   **Lack of Refinement:** The solution doesn't include the capability of selecting the *best* solution, or refine solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Decision-Making: the ability to select a single, *optimal* meeting time from a set of feasible solutions, incorporating both hard and soft constraints.**\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Scoring Function & Solution Ranking (CRITICAL):**\n    *   Develop a scoring function that considers:\n        *   **Hard Constraint Adherence (Highest Weight):** Assign a *huge* penalty for violating hard constraints (existing meetings, working hours).\n        *   **Soft Constraint Adherence (Medium Weight):** Assign a penalty for violating \"would rather not meet\" preferences.  The *more* a preference is violated, the *higher* the penalty.\n        *   **Minimize Disruption (Lowest Weight):** As a tie-breaker, consider factors like minimizing the total number of participants moved from their ideal workflow.\n    *   Implement a solution ranking process that sorts candidate solutions based on their scores.\n\n2.  **Refine Prompt with Explicit Instructions (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **Emphasize \"Single Best Solution\":**  The prompt *must* explicitly state, \"You *must* return *only one* time slot that is the *best possible* solution, considering all constraints and preferences.\"\n    *   **Detail Preference Handling:** Add explicit instructions on how to handle preferences: \"Prioritize time slots that *minimize* conflicts with participants' preferences. A solution that violates a 'would rather not meet' preference is *less desirable* than one that does not.  A solution that violates *more* preferences is *worse* than one that violates fewer preferences.\"\n    *   **Example with Preference Trade-offs:**  Include a few-shot example where the \"best\" solution is selected because it avoids *more* preference violations than alternatives, *even if* it means *one* participant gets their preference violated.\n\n3.  **Add Verification Step (HIGH):**\n    *   Incorporate a solution verification step that explicitly checks:\n        *   Whether the selected time slot violates *any* hard constraints.  If so, *reject* the solution and trigger a re-evaluation.\n        *   How many soft constraints are violated. This check will be used during the scoring process (implemented in recommendation 1)\n\n4.  **Use Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (MEDIUM):**\n    *   Implement a chain-of-thought process where the system *explicitly explains* its reasoning for *rejecting* alternative time slots and *choosing* the selected solution. For example: \"I rejected Monday at 10:00 because it violates Harold's schedule.  I chose Wednesday at 14:00 because, while Brandon prefers not to meet then, it is the *only* remaining time slot that does not violate anyone's *hard* constraints, and it only violates *one* preference.\"\n\n5.  **Few-Shot Examples of Trade-offs (HIGH):**\n    *   Crucially, provide a few-shot example illustrating the *trade-offs* that must be made when no single solution satisfies all preferences.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level**.

This suggests the code execution itself is not crashing, but rather producing logically incorrect results.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** The system appears to be able to identify and incorporate basic constraints related to time availability and preferences. It correctly excludes time slots where participants have existing meetings.\n2.  **Solution Generation:** The system generates a list of candidate time slots that generally adhere to the specified working hours (9:00 to 17:00) and meeting duration (half an hour or one hour).\n3. **Information Extraction:** The system seems to be able to extract the participants, the duration, the time windows and the schedules from the problem description.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Lack of Single Best Solution:** The system consistently returns multiple possible time slots instead of identifying and providing a single, optimal solution as expected by the golden answers. This indicates a failure in decision-making. The instructions clearly state \"Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant\", which the system is not utilizing to narrow down to a single best option.\n2.  **Failure to Heed Preferences:** While the system considers hard constraints (existing schedules), it doesn't consistently prioritize preferences (e.g., \"Harold would rather not meet on Monday after 14:00\"). This suggests inadequate constraint handling related to softer preferences.\n3. **Inconsistent Application of Constraints:** In sample 3, Bobby wants to avoid meetings on Thursday and Friday, and Brandon wants to avoid meetings on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesdays before noon. The golden answer suggests a meeting on Wednesday after noon (13:30 - 14:00).

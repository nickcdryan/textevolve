The formatting is correct, but the underlying data is wrong. The system confidently delivers these incorrect answers without any indication of uncertainty or error detection. This suggests the system is blindly trusting its information source, regardless of its veracity. The fact that no runtime errors are present indicates the problem isn't with code execution but with *what* the code is processing and outputting. The sample outputs corroborate the Error Analysis's observation that the system doesn't reason but merely extracts.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a *limited* capability in extracting relevant information and formatting output. However, its core capability of providing accurate answers is severely compromised. The system's current architecture prioritizes extraction and presentation over accuracy, making it practically unusable in its current state. The lack of verification makes the system actively detrimental, as it confidently propagates misinformation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** Consistently formats output within specified tags.\n*   **Information Extraction (Basic):** Identifies entities and relationships within the question.\n\nThese strengths are secondary given the overwhelming weakness in accuracy.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Factual Accuracy:** Extremely low accuracy due to reliance on unreliable knowledge sources.\n*   **Lack of Verification:** No mechanism to validate retrieved information.\n*   **Overconfidence:** Presents incorrect information as definitive answers.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Knowledge Source Verification:** Implementing a robust verification mechanism to validate the accuracy of retrieved information before presenting it as an answer. This directly addresses the primary issue.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Knowledge Verification Module (Immediate):**\n    *   Before outputting any answer, implement a module that:\n        *   Queries at least two *independent* and reputable knowledge sources (e.g., Wikidata, a dedicated fact-checking API).\n        *   Compares the retrieved information.\n        *   If sources disagree, flag the answer as \"uncertain\" or \"unverified\" and do *not* provide an answer.\n    *   **Rationale:** This is the most direct way to mitigate the risk of providing incorrect information.\n2.  **Develop a Fact Verification Scoring Mechanism (Next Iteration):**\n    *   Train a fact verification model or use an existing one.\n    *   Score potential answers based on their likelihood of being true.\n    *   Implement a confidence threshold. Only answers above the threshold should be presented.\n    *   **Rationale:** Provides a more nuanced approach to verification, allowing the system to handle varying levels of uncertainty.\n3.  **Audit and Improve Knowledge Source (Ongoing):**\n    *   Identify the current knowledge source being used by the system.\n    *   Perform a thorough audit to assess its accuracy.\n    *   Explore alternative, more reputable knowledge sources.\n    *   Implement a process for regularly updating and verifying the knowledge base.\n    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the root cause of the problem by ensuring the system has access to accurate information.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining:** The system's usefulness is currently severely hampered by its inaccuracy. Without immediate and significant improvements, its value will continue to erode. Focusing on knowledge source verification is crucial to reversing this trend.\n",

The system's current architecture prioritizes extraction and presentation over accuracy, making it practically unusable in its current state. The lack of verification makes the system actively detrimental, as it confidently propagates misinformation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** Consistently formats output within specified tags.\n*   **Information Extraction (Basic):** Identifies entities and relationships within the question.\n\nThese strengths are secondary given the overwhelming weakness in accuracy.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Factual Accuracy:** Extremely low accuracy due to reliance on unreliable knowledge sources.\n*   **Lack of Verification:** No mechanism to validate retrieved information.\n*   **Overconfidence:** Presents incorrect information as definitive answers.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Knowledge Source Verification:** Implementing a robust verification mechanism to validate the accuracy of retrieved information before presenting it as an answer. This directly addresses the primary issue.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Knowledge Verification Module (Immediate):**\n    *   Before outputting any answer, implement a module that:\n        *   Queries at least two *independent* and reputable knowledge sources (e.g., Wikidata, a dedicated fact-checking API).\n        *   Compares the retrieved information.\n        *   If sources disagree, flag the answer as \"uncertain\" or \"unverified\" and do *not* provide an answer.\n    *   **Rationale:** This is the most direct way to mitigate the risk of providing incorrect information.\n2.  **Develop a Fact Verification Scoring Mechanism (Next Iteration):**\n    *   Train a fact verification model or use an existing one.\n    *   Score potential answers based on their likelihood of being true.\n    *   Implement a confidence threshold. Only answers above the threshold should be presented.\n    *   **Rationale:** Provides a more nuanced approach to verification, allowing the system to handle varying levels of uncertainty.\n3.  **Audit and Improve Knowledge Source (Ongoing):**\n    *   Identify the current knowledge source being used by the system.\n    *   Perform a thorough audit to assess its accuracy.\n    *   Explore alternative, more reputable knowledge sources.\n    *   Implement a process for regularly updating and verifying the knowledge base.\n    *   **Rationale:** Addresses the root cause of the problem by ensuring the system has access to accurate information.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining:** The system's usefulness is currently severely hampered by its inaccuracy. Without immediate and significant improvements, its value will continue to erode. Focusing on knowledge source verification is crucial to reversing this trend.\n"

However, its overall capability is significantly hampered by inaccuracies in parsing complex schedule information and integrating both hard and soft constraints. **The system currently demonstrates a Limited Capability for realistic meeting scheduling scenarios.**\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Constraint Awareness:** The system acknowledges and attempts to adhere to stated availability constraints.\n*   **Iterative Approach:** The system can iterate through time slots, demonstrating a basic search capability.\n*   **Problem Understanding**: The system shows a good understanding of the overall goal.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Schedule Parsing Accuracy:** Unreliable extraction of participant availability from natural language descriptions. This is the most severe weakness.\n*   **Constraint Integration:** Inconsistent and imperfect integration of hard (availability) and soft (preference) constraints.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Inadequate verification of proposed solutions leading to incorrect \"no feasible solution\" conclusions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Information Extraction (Schedule Parsing)** is the single most important capability to focus on improving. A significant increase in schedule parsing accuracy will directly address the primary issue and have the most significant positive impact on overall system performance.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Structured Data Extraction**: Replace free-form text parsing with a prompt designed to extract availability information and structure it into a list of busy intervals for each participant on each day. Use the example format provided in the original report:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"John\": {\n        \"Monday\": [],\n        \"Tuesday\": [],\n        \"Wednesday\": []\n      },\n      \"Jennifer\": {\n        \"Monday\": [[\"9:00\", \"11:00\"], [\"11:30\", \"13:00\"], [\"13:30\", \"14:30\"], [\"15:00\", \"17:00\"]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[\"9:00\", \"11:30\"], [\"12:00\", \"17:00\"]],\n        \"Wednesday\": [[\"9:00\", \"11:30\"], [\"12:00\", \"12:30\"], [\"13:00\", \"14:00\"], [\"14:30\", \"16:00\"], [\"16:30\", \"17:00\"]]\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    **Rationale:**  This will force the LLM to produce structured, consistent output that is easier to process and less prone to interpretation errors.\n\n2.  **Develop a dedicated Schedule Extraction Agent**: Create an agent whose sole responsibility is to extract schedule information and format it into the structured data format described above. This agent should use chain-of-thought reasoning to explain its parsing process and identify potential ambiguities.  Feed the extracted data to the primary scheduling agent.\n    **Rationale:**  Specialization and clear responsibility lead to more reliable performance.\n\n3.  **Multi-Agent Solution Verification:** Implement a secondary \"verifier\" agent whose sole purpose is to confirm or deny the solution agent's solution based on the structured schedule data. This verifier should explicitly check all constraints against the proposed time slot.\n    **Rationale**: Reduces single agent error.\n\n4.  **Refine Constraint Handling with Scoring:** Separate hard and soft constraints.\n    *   First, use the structured data to definitively identify all *available* time slots that satisfy all *hard* constraints.\n    *   Then, *score* those available time slots based on how well they meet *soft* constraints.\n    *   Select the highest scoring time slot.\n    **Rationale**: Provides a structured method for trading off constraints, while still providing valid solutions.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the current accuracy rate of 0.40 and the identified weaknesses, the capability trend is currently **Stable, Low**. Without significant improvements in information extraction, the system will likely remain at this level. Implementing the actionable recommendations above has the potential to shift the trend to **Improving** in the next iteration.\n",

However, its overall capability is significantly hampered by inaccuracies in parsing complex schedule information and integrating both hard and soft constraints. **The system currently demonstrates a Limited Capability for realistic meeting scheduling scenarios.**\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Constraint Awareness:** The system acknowledges and attempts to adhere to stated availability constraints.\n*   **Iterative Approach:** The system can iterate through time slots, demonstrating a basic search capability.\n*   **Problem Understanding**: The system shows a good understanding of the overall goal.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Schedule Parsing Accuracy:** Unreliable extraction of participant availability from natural language descriptions. This is the most severe weakness.\n*   **Constraint Integration:** Inconsistent and imperfect integration of hard (availability) and soft (preference) constraints.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Inadequate verification of proposed solutions leading to incorrect \"no feasible solution\" conclusions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Information Extraction (Schedule Parsing)** is the single most important capability to focus on improving. A significant increase in schedule parsing accuracy will directly address the primary issue and have the most significant positive impact on overall system performance.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Structured Data Extraction**: Replace free-form text parsing with a prompt designed to extract availability information and structure it into a list of busy intervals for each participant on each day. Use the example format provided in the original report:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"John\": {\n        \"Monday\": [],\n        \"Tuesday\": [],\n        \"Wednesday\": []\n      },\n      \"Jennifer\": {\n        \"Monday\": [[\"9:00\", \"11:00\"], [\"11:30\", \"13:00\"], [\"13:30\", \"14:30\"], [\"15:00\", \"17:00\"]],\n        \"Tuesday\": [[\"9:00\", \"11:30\"], [\"12:00\", \"17:00\"]],\n        \"Wednesday\": [[\"9:00\", \"11:30\"], [\"12:00\", \"12:30\"], [\"13:00\", \"14:00\"], [\"14:30\", \"16:00\"], [\"16:30\", \"17:00\"]]\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    **Rationale:**  This will force the LLM to produce structured, consistent output that is easier to process and less prone to interpretation errors.\n\n2.  **Develop a dedicated Schedule Extraction Agent**: Create an agent whose sole responsibility is to extract schedule information and format it into the structured data format described above. This agent should use chain-of-thought reasoning to explain its parsing process and identify potential ambiguities.  Feed the extracted data to the primary scheduling agent.\n    **Rationale:**  Specialization and clear responsibility lead to more reliable performance.\n\n3.  **Multi-Agent Solution Verification:** Implement a secondary \"verifier\" agent whose sole purpose is to confirm or deny the solution agent's solution based on the structured schedule data. This verifier should explicitly check all constraints against the proposed time slot.\n    **Rationale**: Reduces single agent error.\n\n4.  **Refine Constraint Handling with Scoring:** Separate hard and soft constraints.\n    *   First, use the structured data to definitively identify all *available* time slots that satisfy all *hard* constraints.\n    *   Then, *score* those available time slots based on how well they meet *soft* constraints.\n    *   Select the highest scoring time slot.\n    **Rationale**: Provides a structured method for trading off constraints, while still providing valid solutions.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the current accuracy rate of 0.40 and the identified weaknesses, the capability trend is currently **Stable, Low**. Without significant improvements in information extraction, the system will likely remain at this level. Implementing the actionable recommendations above has the potential to shift the trend to **Improving** in the next iteration.\n"

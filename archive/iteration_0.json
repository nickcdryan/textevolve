  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM to extract scheduling constraints, find available meeting times, and verify the proposed solution through chain-of-thought reasoning with example-based prompts. The problem is decomposed into constraint extraction, time availability search, and solution verification; no explicit agent roles are defined beyond the generic LLM calls. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `extract_constraints_with_examples` to parse the input text, then `find_available_times_with_examples` to determine a suitable time, and finally `verify_solution_with_examples` to confirm the solution's validity.",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a basic capability to schedule meetings by identifying participants, time constraints, and attempting to satisfy preferences. However, its overall effectiveness is significantly hampered by unreliable conflict checking and inconsistent decision-making. The current accuracy of 40% (2/5) indicates a need for substantial improvements, particularly in its ability to accurately determine available time slots. The system shows some understanding of the problem domain but lacks the robustness and reliability required for practical application. It relies heavily on manual iteration where LLM reasoning would be more appropriate.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Participant and Constraint Identification:** The system is generally good at extracting the participants, desired duration, and overall time window from the input text. This is a foundational capability that should be maintained.\n*   **Logical Workflow:** The system attempts to follow a logical sequence of identifying possible time slots, checking for conflicts, and selecting a final solution. Preserving this structure is important.\n*   **Preference Awareness:** The system recognizes the existence of participant preferences and tries to incorporate them into the scheduling process. This aspect should be nurtured, but *only after* availability is reliably determined.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Conflict Checking (CRITICAL):** The system frequently misidentifies available time slots due to errors in constraint combination and schedule parsing. This is the single biggest obstacle to accurate scheduling.\n*   **Suboptimal Solution Selection:** The process for choosing the \"best\" time slot lacks clear criteria and is applied inconsistently, leading to suboptimal choices even when valid options exist.\n*   **Limited Use of LLM Reasoning:** The system relies too heavily on manual logic and not enough on the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling and Conflict Detection**. Improving the accuracy with which the system determines if a time slot is genuinely available for all participants is paramount. Without this, all other efforts are undermined. This should be approached by incorporating LLM reasoning.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Prioritize LLM-Driven Conflict Detection:** Implement the `is_slot_available` function suggested previously, using an LLM to reason about schedules and constraints. Remove manual iteration and complex conditional logic in favor of LLM reasoning.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_slot_available(slot_start, slot_end, participants, schedules):\n        \"\"\"\n        Use LLM to verify if a given slot is truly available.\n        \"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Determine if the time slot {slot_start} - {slot_end} is available for all participants: {', '.join(participants)}.\n        Here are the schedules: {schedules}.\n        Consider all constraints and busy times.\n        Respond with True if the slot is available for everyone, False otherwise. Explain your reasoning step by step. Provide your reasoning, then state True or False on the final line.\n        \"\"\"\n        response = call_llm(system=\"Carefully analyze participant schedules to determine availability, and reason step by step. Conclude with 'True' or 'False'.\", user=prompt)\n        return \"True\" in response # LLM answers True or False\n    ```\n    **Rationale:** This directly addresses the critical bottleneck of inaccurate conflict checking. Using an LLM leverages its ability to understand natural language descriptions of schedules and constraints better than rigid parsing rules.  The `step by step` and `reasoning` components will help LLMs generate higher quality solutions.\n\n2.  **Implement Mandatory Solution Verification with LLM:**  Add the `verify_solution` function to *always* confirm a proposed solution before finalizing it.  If the LLM-based verification fails, reject the solution and continue searching.\n\n    ```python\n    def verify_solution(proposed_time, participants, schedules):\n        \"\"\"\n        Use LLM to rigorously verify a proposed solution.\n        \"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Verify that the proposed meeting time {proposed_time} works for all participants: {', '.join(participants)}.\n        Their schedules are: {schedules}.\n        Thoroughly check for any conflicts or constraint violations.\n        Provide a detailed explanation of why it works or doesn't work. Be explicit.\n        Return \"Valid\" if it works. Return \"Invalid\" plus the reason if it doesn't.\n        \"\"\"\n        response = call_llm(system=\"Act as a strict schedule verifier, providing detailed justifications. If the proposed solution does not work, explain the specific reason and schedule that makes it invalid.\", user=prompt)\n        return response\n    ```\n\n    **Rationale:** This adds a safety net to catch errors that the primary conflict detection might miss. It reinforces the critical area and reduces the error propagation identified earlier.\n\n3. **Introduce LLM-Based Prioritization and Weighing:** For cases where multiple solutions appear to be valid, implement functions to weigh preferences and availability, with explicit explanations:\n\n    ```python\n    def weigh_preference_vs_availability(available_slots, preferences, schedules):\n      prompt = f\"\"\"\n      I have the following available meeting times for the listed participants, with the associated schedules and preferences. Weigh the options and choose the optimal time. Available times: {available_slots}. Schedules: {schedules}. Preferences: {preferences}. Which time should be selected given schedules and preferences? Explain your reasoning. Be explicit about how you weigh each aspect.\"\"\"\n      response = call_llm(system='You are an expert scheduler who knows how to weigh preferences against availability for busy people. Be explicit about your reasoning for picking the optimal solution.', user = prompt)\n      return parse_optimal_time(response)\n    ```\n\n    **Rationale:** LLMs are better positioned to understand trade-offs between availability and preferences than hard-coded rules. By incorporating LLMs, the system has better odds of picking schedules that respect preferences without sacrificing schedules.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance summary and error analysis, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but inadequate**. The accuracy of 40% indicates that it's not improving, and the identified weaknesses need to be addressed for any meaningful progress. After the suggested improvements are implemented, the trend should be closely monitored to determine if the changes are driving the desired improvement.\n",

    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a basic capability to schedule meetings by identifying participants, time constraints, and attempting to satisfy preferences. However, its overall effectiveness is significantly hampered by unreliable conflict checking and inconsistent decision-making. The current accuracy of 40% (2/5) indicates a need for substantial improvements, particularly in its ability to accurately determine available time slots. The system shows some understanding of the problem domain but lacks the robustness and reliability required for practical application. It relies heavily on manual iteration where LLM reasoning would be more appropriate.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Participant and Constraint Identification:** The system is generally good at extracting the participants, desired duration, and overall time window from the input text. This is a foundational capability that should be maintained.\n*   **Logical Workflow:** The system attempts to follow a logical sequence of identifying possible time slots, checking for conflicts, and selecting a final solution. Preserving this structure is important.\n*   **Preference Awareness:** The system recognizes the existence of participant preferences and tries to incorporate them into the scheduling process. This aspect should be nurtured, but *only after* availability is reliably determined.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Conflict Checking (CRITICAL):** The system frequently misidentifies available time slots due to errors in constraint combination and schedule parsing. This is the single biggest obstacle to accurate scheduling.\n*   **Suboptimal Solution Selection:** The process for choosing the \"best\" time slot lacks clear criteria and is applied inconsistently, leading to suboptimal choices even when valid options exist.\n*   **Limited Use of LLM Reasoning:** The system relies too heavily on manual logic and not enough on the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling and Conflict Detection**. Improving the accuracy with which the system determines if a time slot is genuinely available for all participants is paramount. Without this, all other efforts are undermined. This should be approached by incorporating LLM reasoning.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Prioritize LLM-Driven Conflict Detection:** Implement the `is_slot_available` function suggested previously, using an LLM to reason about schedules and constraints. Remove manual iteration and complex conditional logic in favor of LLM reasoning.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_slot_available(slot_start, slot_end, participants, schedules):\n        \"\"\"\n        Use LLM to verify if a given slot is truly available.\n        \"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Determine if the time slot {slot_start} - {slot_end} is available for all participants: {', '.join(participants)}.\n        Here are the schedules: {schedules}.\n        Consider all constraints and busy times.\n        Respond with True if the slot is available for everyone, False otherwise. Explain your reasoning step by step. Provide your reasoning, then state True or False on the final line.\n        \"\"\"\n        response = call_llm(system=\"Carefully analyze participant schedules to determine availability, and reason step by step. Conclude with 'True' or 'False'.\", user=prompt)\n        return \"True\" in response # LLM answers True or False\n    ```\n    **Rationale:** This directly addresses the critical bottleneck of inaccurate conflict checking. Using an LLM leverages its ability to understand natural language descriptions of schedules and constraints better than rigid parsing rules.  The `step by step` and `reasoning` components will help LLMs generate higher quality solutions.\n\n2.  **Implement Mandatory Solution Verification with LLM:**  Add the `verify_solution` function to *always* confirm a proposed solution before finalizing it.  If the LLM-based verification fails, reject the solution and continue searching.\n\n    ```python\n    def verify_solution(proposed_time, participants, schedules):\n        \"\"\"\n        Use LLM to rigorously verify a proposed solution.\n        \"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Verify that the proposed meeting time {proposed_time} works for all participants: {', '.join(participants)}.\n        Their schedules are: {schedules}.\n        Thoroughly check for any conflicts or constraint violations.\n        Provide a detailed explanation of why it works or doesn't work. Be explicit.\n        Return \"Valid\" if it works. Return \"Invalid\" plus the reason if it doesn't.\n        \"\"\"\n        response = call_llm(system=\"Act as a strict schedule verifier, providing detailed justifications. If the proposed solution does not work, explain the specific reason and schedule that makes it invalid.\", user=prompt)\n        return response\n    ```\n\n    **Rationale:** This adds a safety net to catch errors that the primary conflict detection might miss. It reinforces the critical area and reduces the error propagation identified earlier.\n\n3. **Introduce LLM-Based Prioritization and Weighing:** For cases where multiple solutions appear to be valid, implement functions to weigh preferences and availability, with explicit explanations:\n\n    ```python\n    def weigh_preference_vs_availability(available_slots, preferences, schedules):\n      prompt = f\"\"\"\n      I have the following available meeting times for the listed participants, with the associated schedules and preferences. Weigh the options and choose the optimal time. Available times: {available_slots}. Schedules: {schedules}. Preferences: {preferences}. Which time should be selected given schedules and preferences? Explain your reasoning. Be explicit about how you weigh each aspect.\"\"\"\n      response = call_llm(system='You are an expert scheduler who knows how to weigh preferences against availability for busy people. Be explicit about your reasoning for picking the optimal solution.', user = prompt)\n      return parse_optimal_time(response)\n    ```\n\n    **Rationale:** LLMs are better positioned to understand trade-offs between availability and preferences than hard-coded rules. By incorporating LLMs, the system has better odds of picking schedules that respect preferences without sacrificing schedules.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance summary and error analysis, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but inadequate**. The accuracy of 40% indicates that it's not improving, and the identified weaknesses need to be addressed for any meaningful progress. After the suggested improvements are implemented, the trend should be closely monitored to determine if the changes are driving the desired improvement.\n"

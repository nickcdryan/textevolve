  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using an LLM to extract information, infer transformation rules, apply the rules, and verify the results. It decomposes the problem into extraction, inference, transformation, and verification steps, each handled by prompting the LLM with a specific system instruction defining the agent's role as an expert in grid transformations. The `main` function calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which orchestrates calls to `call_llm` for each step, using prompts constructed with f-strings to pass instructions and data. Function calls: `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which in turn calls `call_llm` multiple times to perform the different stages of the grid transformation.",

However, the consistently incorrect answers suggest logical errors and/or misunderstanding of the underlying patterns. The outputs are syntactically correct JSON, but semantically wrong.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **JSON Output:** The system consistently produces valid JSON outputs, indicating a robust understanding of output formatting requirements.\n2.  **Problem Comprehension:** The AI appears to comprehend the basic task of transforming a grid based on training examples. It's attempting to identify and apply patterns.\n3. **Adaptation to Input Size:** It seems to be able to work with grids of different dimensions.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The primary weakness is the inability to accurately discern and apply the transformation patterns demonstrated in the training examples. The system fails to identify the relationships between input and output grids.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning:** The system struggles with the spatial relationships and transformations required to generate the correct output grid.\n3. **Overgeneralization/Insufficient Specificity:** The system may be overgeneralizing from the training examples, leading to incorrect transformations on the test input, or not noticing small details.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Pattern Identification:** The inability to correctly identify the transformation patterns. This is the core reason for the incorrect outputs.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Spatial Reasoning:** The system does not appear to be able to properly process spatial relationships and apply spatial logic correctly, causing errors in transforming grids.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nA recurring pattern is the generation of an output grid that is structurally similar to the *input* grid of the test case, rather than mirroring the structural changes observed *between* input and output grids in the *training examples*. The answers often reuse elements from the input instead of transforming them as shown in the training examples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's flawed understanding of the transformation patterns. It needs a more sophisticated mechanism for identifying and implementing the spatial transformations demonstrated in the training examples. It isn't learning the transformations correctly.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the pattern recognition module to accurately identify and extract the transformation rules.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning:** Enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities to correctly apply transformations to the input grid based on the identified patterns.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce an explicit pattern extraction step:** Implement a module that explicitly extracts transformation rules from the training examples. This could involve identifying changes in specific cell values or relationships between cell positions. For example: \"If cell [x, y] is 1, then the corresponding cell in the output is 2\".\n2.  **Implement a spatial reasoning module:** This module should be responsible for applying the extracted transformation rules to the test input, considering the spatial relationships between cells. This could involve using convolution operations or other spatial processing techniques.\n3.  **Refine training data representation:** Ensure the training data is presented in a way that highlights the transformations, possibly by explicitly labelling corresponding cells in the input and output grids. This would allow the system to more easily capture the relationship between the grids.\n4. **Increase the diversity and quantity of training examples:** More examples would help the system generalize better.\n5. **Add intermediate print statements during reasoning:** Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to accurately extract the grid transformation pattern.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an incorrect output grid due to flawed pattern recognition.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Incorrect output not verified against the inferred pattern.\n\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to accurately extract the grid transformation pattern.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an incorrect output grid due to flawed pattern recognition.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Incorrect output not verified against the inferred pattern.\n\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to accurately extract the grid transformation pattern.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an incorrect output grid due to flawed pattern recognition.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Incorrect output not verified against the inferred pattern.\n",

The system consistently generates JSON-formatted grids, which is a positive sign for output formatting. However, the content of the grids is consistently incorrect.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The output `[[2, 0, 0],[0, 2, 0],[2, 0, 0]]` shows a rudimentary attempt at pattern replication, possibly based on the existence of \"2\" in the input. It demonstrates an awareness of the need for a 3x3 grid, but the positioning of '2' seems arbitrary and doesn't reflect learned transformations.\n\n*   **Sample 1:** The output suggests an attempt to incorporate numbers present in the input into the output. The presence of 0, 1, 2, and 4 (all from the input) in the output grid supports this hypothesis. The output appears to have some sort of symmetry.\n\n*   **Sample 2:** The output is a larger grid than the input, showing some awareness of grid size. It appears to be attempting to map some input values from the input grid onto the output grid.\n\nAcross all samples, the AI seems to be doing *something* with the input numbers, but it's clearly not learning or applying the complex spatial transformations required. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags are correctly used, indicating proper output formatting.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic capability for understanding the input/output format and producing valid JSON. However, its core capability of identifying and applying spatial transformation patterns from training examples is essentially non-existent. The system fails to generalize from training data to new inputs, resulting in consistently incorrect outputs. The attempt to adapt to the input size shows some promise.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **JSON Output:** Consistent generation of valid JSON outputs.\n*   **Problem Comprehension (Basic):** Understands the fundamental task of grid transformation.\n*   **Adaptation to Input Size (Rudimentary):** Shows some ability to adjust the output grid size.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Unable to accurately identify and apply transformation patterns.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Struggles to understand and implement spatial relationships between grid elements.\n*   **Generalization:** Fails to generalize from training examples to new input grids.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most critical area for improvement is **Pattern Recognition**. The system must be able to accurately extract the transformation rules from the training data. Without this, no other improvements will yield significant gains.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Pattern Extraction:** Develop a dedicated module that analyzes training examples and extracts transformation rules. This module should focus on identifying changes in cell values, relationships between cell positions, and any other relevant patterns. For instance, identify rules like \"If cell [x, y] in input grid is 'A', then the corresponding cell [x', y'] in output grid is 'B'\". This module needs to represent these rules in a structured, machine-readable format. *Example:* Consider a simplified pattern rule: `{\"input_cell\": [x, y], \"input_value\": A, \"output_cell\": [x', y'], \"output_value\": B}`.\n2.  **Introduce a Spatial Reasoning Module:** This module will take the extracted pattern rules from step 1 and apply them to the test input grid. It will need to understand how to translate the `[x, y]` coordinates from the pattern rules to the correct positions in the test input grid. This may involve using convolution-like operations, spatial indexing, or other spatial processing techniques. *Example:* Given an extracted rule: `{\"input_cell\": [0, 0], \"input_value\": 1, \"output_cell\": [1, 1], \"output_value\": 2}`, the module would check the value of the top-left cell ([0,0]) in the input grid. If it's '1', then the module would set the value of the center cell ([1,1]) in the output grid to '2'.\n3.  **Improve Training Data Representation for Pattern Highlighting:** Instead of simply providing input and output grids, consider explicitly labelling corresponding cells in the training examples. For example, create a data structure that links cells in the input grid to their transformed counterparts in the output grid. This could make it easier for the system to learn the relationships between the grids. You can also explore data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training data.\n4.  **Add Debugging Tools (Intermediate Print Statements):** Implement print statements within the pattern extraction and spatial reasoning modules to track the intermediate steps. This will allow you to diagnose why the system is making incorrect transformations. Print statements like \"Extracted Rule:...\", \"Applying Rule...\", \"Input Grid:...\", and \"Output Grid:...\" will be invaluable for debugging.\n5. **Implement input normalization/scaling**: If the range of values in the grid is large, normalize the values to a smaller range to potentially ease learning.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **stable at a very low level**. The system consistently fails to perform the core task of pattern recognition and spatial transformation. A significant improvement is needed to move beyond this baseline. Without changes, the capability will remain at 0.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are directly visible in the provided 'output' fields. However, the consistently incorrect answers suggest logical errors and/or misunderstanding of the underlying patterns. The outputs are syntactically correct JSON, but semantically wrong.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **JSON Output:** The system consistently produces valid JSON outputs, indicating a robust understanding of output formatting requirements.\n2.  **Problem Comprehension:** The AI appears to comprehend the basic task of transforming a grid based on training examples. It's attempting to identify and apply patterns.\n3. **Adaptation to Input Size:** It seems to be able to work with grids of different dimensions.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The primary weakness is the inability to accurately discern and apply the transformation patterns demonstrated in the training examples. The system fails to identify the relationships between input and output grids.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning:** The system struggles with the spatial relationships and transformations required to generate the correct output grid.\n3. **Overgeneralization/Insufficient Specificity:** The system may be overgeneralizing from the training examples, leading to incorrect transformations on the test input, or not noticing small details.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Pattern Identification:** The inability to correctly identify the transformation patterns. This is the core reason for the incorrect outputs.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Spatial Reasoning:** The system does not appear to be able to properly process spatial relationships and apply spatial logic correctly, causing errors in transforming grids.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nA recurring pattern is the generation of an output grid that is structurally similar to the *input* grid of the test case, rather than mirroring the structural changes observed *between* input and output grids in the *training examples*. The answers often reuse elements from the input instead of transforming them as shown in the training examples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's flawed understanding of the transformation patterns. It needs a more sophisticated mechanism for identifying and implementing the spatial transformations demonstrated in the training examples. It isn't learning the transformations correctly.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the pattern recognition module to accurately identify and extract the transformation rules.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning:** Enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities to correctly apply transformations to the input grid based on the identified patterns.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce an explicit pattern extraction step:** Implement a module that explicitly extracts transformation rules from the training examples. This could involve identifying changes in specific cell values or relationships between cell positions. For example: \"If cell [x, y] is 1, then the corresponding cell in the output is 2\".\n2.  **Implement a spatial reasoning module:** This module should be responsible for applying the extracted transformation rules to the test input, considering the spatial relationships between cells. This could involve using convolution operations or other spatial processing techniques.\n3.  **Refine training data representation:** Ensure the training data is presented in a way that highlights the transformations, possibly by explicitly labelling corresponding cells in the input and output grids. This would allow the system to more easily capture the relationship between the grids.\n4. **Increase the diversity and quantity of training examples:** More examples would help the system generalize better.\n5. **Add intermediate print statements during reasoning:** Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to accurately extract the grid transformation pattern.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an incorrect output grid due to flawed pattern recognition.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Incorrect output not verified against the inferred pattern.\n\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to accurately extract the grid transformation pattern.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an incorrect output grid due to flawed pattern recognition.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Incorrect output not verified against the inferred pattern.\n\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to accurately extract the grid transformation pattern.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an incorrect output grid due to flawed pattern recognition.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Incorrect output not verified against the inferred pattern.\n",

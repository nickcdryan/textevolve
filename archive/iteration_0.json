Considering Billy's Preference:**\n\nBilly prefers to avoid meetings after 15:00. This makes the following times ideal.\n\n*   **9:30 - 10:00**\n*   **11:00 - 11:30**\n*   **13:30 - 14:00**\n*   **14:30 - 15:00**\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nI recommend scheduling the meeting for **9:30 - 10:00 on Monday**. This time works for everyone, fulfills the time constraints and also respects Billy's preference to avoid meetings after 15:00.\n. Verification: The solution appears to be logically sound and well-structured. Let's verify each step:\n\n1.  **Available Time Slots for Each Person:**\n    *   Raymond: The solution correctly identifies Raymond's available slots by excluding the blocked times: 9:30-11:30, 12:00-13:00, 13:30-15:00, 15:30-17:00\n    *   Billy:  The solution correctly identifies Billy's available slots by excluding the blocked times: 9:00-10:00, 10:30-12:00, 13:00-16:30\n    *   Donald: The solution correctly identifies Donald's available slots by excluding the blocked times: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-12:00, 13:00-14:00, 14:30-16:00\n\n2.  **Overlapping Available Time Slots (30 minutes minimum):**\n    *   9:30 - 10:00: Raymond, Billy, and Donald are all available. This is correct.\n    *   11:00 - 11:30: Raymond, Billy, and Donald are all available. This is correct.\n    *   13:30 - 14:00: Raymond, Billy, and Donald are all available. This is correct.\n    *   14:30 - 15:00: Raymond, Billy, and Donald are all available. This is correct.\n    *   15:30 - 16:00: Raymond, Billy, and Donald are all available. This is correct.\n\n3.  **Considering Billy's Preference:**\n    *   The solution correctly filters the overlapping slots to only consider those before 15:00, based on Billy's preference.\n\n4.  **Recommendation:**\n    *   The solution recommends 9:30 - 10:00, which is a valid option and respects Billy's preference.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe solution correctly identifies the available time slots for each person, finds the overlapping time slots, and takes into account Billy's preference. The recommendation is a valid and reasonable choice. The solution satisfies all constraints.\n\nANSWER_END\n",

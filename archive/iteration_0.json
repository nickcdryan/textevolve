The LLM is prompted to act as an expert in pattern recognition for grid transformations. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates this process, calling the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini API for both analysis and transformation steps. The `call_llm` function sends a prompt to the Gemini model and returns the response.",

This is evidenced by the pervasive \"Invalid output format\" error.\n2.  **Robustness:** The system lacks robustness in handling the formatting of the output, leading to a complete failure even if the transformation logic might be partially correct.\n3.  **Rule Extraction:** Even if the core engine is working, the examples are complex, and it's not extracting and implementing the correct rule.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting & JSON Serialization:** The most critical bottleneck is the inability to generate and serialize the transformed grid into a valid JSON (or other expected) format. The \"Expecting value\" error strongly suggests issues during JSON serialization.\n2.  **Incomplete Rule Extraction:** The examples show relationships that must be parsed out to produce an acceptable grid in the prescribed format.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent Output Formatting Errors:** All error cases share the same \"Invalid output format\" error, indicating a systematic problem in the output generation process.\n2.  **Lack of Detailed Error Information:** The error message \"Could not transform\" is generic and doesn't provide specific clues about *why* the transformation failed. This makes debugging difficult.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the failure of the system to properly format and serialize the generated output grid into a valid JSON string representation (or whatever output format is expected). This is coupled with a lack of specific error information when the transformation logic fails.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting & Serialization:** Focus on ensuring the output is formatted as a valid 2D array structure and serialized correctly into a string representation suitable for JSON parsing (if JSON is expected).\n2.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement more detailed error handling and logging. When a transformation fails, log the intermediate steps, the detected rules, and the specific data that caused the failure. This will aid in debugging.\n3.  **Rule Extraction:** Devise a more accurate and robust scheme for detecting patterns that produce correct output based on the training grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a dedicated output formatting function:** Create a function specifically responsible for converting the transformed grid (a 2D array) into the required string representation. This function should be rigorously tested.\n2.  **Add detailed logging:** Include `print` statements (or use a proper logging library) to output the intermediate state of the grid transformation process. This includes:\n    *   The extracted transformation rule.\n    *   The state of the grid after each transformation step.\n    *   Any exceptions or errors encountered during the transformation process.\n3.  **Validate output before returning:** Before returning the output, validate that it conforms to the expected format. If it doesn't, raise an exception with a clear error message.\n4.  **Review JSON handling:** Double-check how the system is using JSON libraries (if applicable) and ensure the data being serialized is compatible with JSON format.\n5.  **Break down the transformation:** Use simpler rules, then gradually increase complexity.\n6.  **Data augmentation:** Create similar, but slightly different examples to test for robustness.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful (likely identified the need for a transformation based on grid values).\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation logic and/or output).\n    *   solution\\_verification: Implicitly failed (did not detect the invalid output).\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Implicitly failed\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Implicitly failed\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\nHere's a capability assessment report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show a critical failure: \"Error: Invalid output format. Could not transform.\" This error is pervasive across all samples, indicating a systematic issue rather than a sporadic one. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest a framework for isolating the AI's response, which is helpful for debugging, but the content within consistently points to output generation failure. The error message itself, while present, lacks granularity; \"Could not transform\" offers little insight into *why* the transformation process failed. The underlying issue likely lies in the AI's inability to correctly generate the required 2D array structure or properly serialize it, potentially as JSON.  The consistent failure suggests a core problem within the output formatting component or the interaction between the transformation logic and the formatting component.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates extremely limited capability in its current state. While it can *potentially* understand the problem and *attempt* to apply transformation rules, its consistent failure to produce correct output renders it effectively useless. Its understanding of the problem, while hypothesized as a strength, cannot be validated given the output formatting failures. It excels at *identifying* the problem (as evidenced by *attempting* a solution), but completely fails at *solving* the problem due to formatting errors.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Potential for Problem Understanding:** The system *attempts* to apply transformation rules, suggesting some level of understanding of the input and output requirements. This is *hypothetical* and needs further validation once the output formatting issue is resolved. Maintaining this initial attempt to understand the problem is vital.\n*   **Clear Error Handling Structure:** The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers provide a structure for isolating and analyzing the system's output. This is helpful for debugging and should be maintained.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Output Formatting Failure:** The inability to generate the output in the correct 2D array format (likely serialized as JSON) is the most significant and debilitating weakness.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** The system fails entirely when faced with formatting challenges, indicating a lack of robustness in its design.\n*   **Limited Error Granularity:** The generic \"Could not transform\" error message provides insufficient information for effective debugging.\n*   **Rule Extraction Inaccuracy:** Even if formatting works, the incorrect output also suggests that, based on the example grids, that the rules being extracted and applied are wrong.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Output Formatting & Serialization**. This is the foundational issue preventing any meaningful progress. Without correctly formatted output, assessing the system's other capabilities (e.g., rule extraction, transformation logic) is impossible.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated and Rigorously Tested Output Formatting Function:** Create a function specifically designed to convert the transformed grid (a 2D array) into a valid, serialized string representation (likely JSON). This function should be thoroughly unit-tested *independently* of the core transformation logic.  Use test cases with various grid sizes and values.\n\n2.  **Introduce Detailed Logging at Key Transformation Stages:** Inject `print` statements (or use a more robust logging library) to capture the intermediate state of the transformation process. Log the extracted rule, the grid state after each transformation step, and any exceptions encountered.\n\n3.  **Implement Output Validation Before Returning:** Before returning the transformed grid, validate its structure and format. If the output doesn't conform to the expected format (e.g., a valid JSON string), raise a specific exception with a descriptive error message.  For example: `\"Output validation failed: Invalid JSON format.\"` or `\"Output validation failed: Grid is not a 2D array.\"`\n\n4.  **Focus on Simpler Rule Sets:** Initially, test the system with examples using *very* simple transformation rules. This helps isolate the output formatting issue from potential rule extraction complexities.  For example, try a rule where each cell's value is simply incremented by 1.\n\n5.  **Review the Output Type Expectations:** Explicitly define the expected output format (e.g., JSON string, comma-separated values) and ensure the system adheres to this format. This is the most basic requirement.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's capabilities are currently **stable and critically low**. The consistent failure pattern suggests no improvement is occurring. Significant changes are required to address the output formatting issue before any meaningful progress can be made. Until the output is formatted correctly, it's impossible to determine if the underlying transformation engine is capable.\n",

This is evidenced by the pervasive \"Invalid output format\" error.\n2.  **Robustness:** The system lacks robustness in handling the formatting of the output, leading to a complete failure even if the transformation logic might be partially correct.\n3.  **Rule Extraction:** Even if the core engine is working, the examples are complex, and it's not extracting and implementing the correct rule.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting & JSON Serialization:** The most critical bottleneck is the inability to generate and serialize the transformed grid into a valid JSON (or other expected) format. The \"Expecting value\" error strongly suggests issues during JSON serialization.\n2.  **Incomplete Rule Extraction:** The examples show relationships that must be parsed out to produce an acceptable grid in the prescribed format.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent Output Formatting Errors:** All error cases share the same \"Invalid output format\" error, indicating a systematic problem in the output generation process.\n2.  **Lack of Detailed Error Information:** The error message \"Could not transform\" is generic and doesn't provide specific clues about *why* the transformation failed. This makes debugging difficult.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the failure of the system to properly format and serialize the generated output grid into a valid JSON string representation (or whatever output format is expected). This is coupled with a lack of specific error information when the transformation logic fails.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting & Serialization:** Focus on ensuring the output is formatted as a valid 2D array structure and serialized correctly into a string representation suitable for JSON parsing (if JSON is expected).\n2.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement more detailed error handling and logging. When a transformation fails, log the intermediate steps, the detected rules, and the specific data that caused the failure. This will aid in debugging.\n3.  **Rule Extraction:** Devise a more accurate and robust scheme for detecting patterns that produce correct output based on the training grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a dedicated output formatting function:** Create a function specifically responsible for converting the transformed grid (a 2D array) into the required string representation. This function should be rigorously tested.\n2.  **Add detailed logging:** Include `print` statements (or use a proper logging library) to output the intermediate state of the grid transformation process. This includes:\n    *   The extracted transformation rule.\n    *   The state of the grid after each transformation step.\n    *   Any exceptions or errors encountered during the transformation process.\n3.  **Validate output before returning:** Before returning the output, validate that it conforms to the expected format. If it doesn't, raise an exception with a clear error message.\n4.  **Review JSON handling:** Double-check how the system is using JSON libraries (if applicable) and ensure the data being serialized is compatible with JSON format.\n5.  **Break down the transformation:** Use simpler rules, then gradually increase complexity.\n6.  **Data augmentation:** Create similar, but slightly different examples to test for robustness.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful (likely identified the need for a transformation based on grid values).\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation logic and/or output).\n    *   solution\\_verification: Implicitly failed (did not detect the invalid output).\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Implicitly failed\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Implicitly failed\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\nHere's a capability assessment report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show a critical failure: \"Error: Invalid output format. Could not transform.\" This error is pervasive across all samples, indicating a systematic issue rather than a sporadic one. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest a framework for isolating the AI's response, which is helpful for debugging, but the content within consistently points to output generation failure. The error message itself, while present, lacks granularity; \"Could not transform\" offers little insight into *why* the transformation process failed. The underlying issue likely lies in the AI's inability to correctly generate the required 2D array structure or properly serialize it, potentially as JSON.  The consistent failure suggests a core problem within the output formatting component or the interaction between the transformation logic and the formatting component.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates extremely limited capability in its current state. While it can *potentially* understand the problem and *attempt* to apply transformation rules, its consistent failure to produce correct output renders it effectively useless. Its understanding of the problem, while hypothesized as a strength, cannot be validated given the output formatting failures. It excels at *identifying* the problem (as evidenced by *attempting* a solution), but completely fails at *solving* the problem due to formatting errors.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Potential for Problem Understanding:** The system *attempts* to apply transformation rules, suggesting some level of understanding of the input and output requirements. This is *hypothetical* and needs further validation once the output formatting issue is resolved. Maintaining this initial attempt to understand the problem is vital.\n*   **Clear Error Handling Structure:** The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers provide a structure for isolating and analyzing the system's output. This is helpful for debugging and should be maintained.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Output Formatting Failure:** The inability to generate the output in the correct 2D array format (likely serialized as JSON) is the most significant and debilitating weakness.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** The system fails entirely when faced with formatting challenges, indicating a lack of robustness in its design.\n*   **Limited Error Granularity:** The generic \"Could not transform\" error message provides insufficient information for effective debugging.\n*   **Rule Extraction Inaccuracy:** Even if formatting works, the incorrect output also suggests that, based on the example grids, that the rules being extracted and applied are wrong.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Output Formatting & Serialization**. This is the foundational issue preventing any meaningful progress. Without correctly formatted output, assessing the system's other capabilities (e.g., rule extraction, transformation logic) is impossible.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated and Rigorously Tested Output Formatting Function:** Create a function specifically designed to convert the transformed grid (a 2D array) into a valid, serialized string representation (likely JSON). This function should be thoroughly unit-tested *independently* of the core transformation logic.  Use test cases with various grid sizes and values.\n\n2.  **Introduce Detailed Logging at Key Transformation Stages:** Inject `print` statements (or use a more robust logging library) to capture the intermediate state of the transformation process. Log the extracted rule, the grid state after each transformation step, and any exceptions encountered.\n\n3.  **Implement Output Validation Before Returning:** Before returning the transformed grid, validate its structure and format. If the output doesn't conform to the expected format (e.g., a valid JSON string), raise a specific exception with a descriptive error message.  For example: `\"Output validation failed: Invalid JSON format.\"` or `\"Output validation failed: Grid is not a 2D array.\"`\n\n4.  **Focus on Simpler Rule Sets:** Initially, test the system with examples using *very* simple transformation rules. This helps isolate the output formatting issue from potential rule extraction complexities.  For example, try a rule where each cell's value is simply incremented by 1.\n\n5.  **Review the Output Type Expectations:** Explicitly define the expected output format (e.g., JSON string, comma-separated values) and ensure the system adheres to this format. This is the most basic requirement.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's capabilities are currently **stable and critically low**. The consistent failure pattern suggests no improvement is occurring. Significant changes are required to address the output formatting issue before any meaningful progress can be made. Until the output is formatted correctly, it's impossible to determine if the underlying transformation engine is capable.\n"

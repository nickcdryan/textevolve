      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) were found in the provided outputs. However, the fact that the extracted data is often incorrect, and the reasoning doesn't follow logically, suggests implicit errors in the reasoning and information processing.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n- The system attempts to extract relevant data from the problem description.\n- The system tries to consider the schedules of all participants.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n- **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** The system frequently extracts incorrect or incomplete schedule information, leading to flawed reasoning.\n- **Poor Constraint Handling:** The system struggles to accurately apply constraints related to meeting duration, preferred times, and participant preferences.\n- **Logical Errors in Schedule Reasoning:** Even with seemingly correct extracted data, the system often fails to deduce valid meeting times. The identified \"available slots\" often conflict with the extracted schedules.\n- **Repetitive and Unnecessary output:** The system repeats the intro, Available Slots: before the answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Information Extraction:** The inaccurate extraction of schedule information is the primary bottleneck, as it feeds incorrect data into the subsequent reasoning steps.\n- **Constraint Handling and Logical Reasoning:** Even when the extraction is accurate, there's a significant bottleneck in correctly applying constraints to deduce feasible meeting times.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- **Discrepancy between Extracted Schedules and \"Available Slots\":** The extracted schedules often contradict the available time slots identified by the system. This indicates a failure in the process of cross-referencing the extracted data with the constraints to derive valid solutions.\n- **Ignoring Preferences:** The system frequently fails to incorporate participant preferences (e.g., \"avoid Monday after 2 PM\") into the solution.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is **inaccurate and unreliable information extraction from the input text**. The entire scheduling logic hinges on the precise and correct extraction of participant schedules, preferences, and constraints. Because this extraction is flawed, the downstream reasoning and solution generation are rendered ineffective. The extraction is not robust enough to handle the variety and nuances present in the text.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Information Extraction:** Significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of information extraction, especially concerning participant schedules and preferences.\n- **Constraint Handling:** Improve the system's ability to accurately apply all constraints, including duration, time preferences, and explicit schedule conflicts.\n- **Logical Reasoning:** Refine the logic used to deduce valid meeting times from extracted data and applied constraints.\n- **Output Formatting:** Remove repetitive and unnecessary text in the output.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Enhance Information Extraction with Few-Shot Examples:** Use few-shot learning with multiple diverse examples to guide the LLM in extracting schedule information more accurately. Include examples with varied sentence structures and schedule formats. Refine the prompt to explicitly ask the LLM to double-check the extracted schedules against the original text for consistency.\n2. **Implement a Verification Loop for Extracted Data:** Add a verification step where the system checks the extracted schedule information against the original problem statement and flags any discrepancies for correction. This could involve prompting the LLM to \"verify that the extracted schedule for John matches what is stated in the original question.\"\n3. **Explicitly Model Constraints:** Rather than implicitly reasoning about constraints, explicitly represent them as data structures (e.g., a list of blocked time intervals for each participant). This will make it easier to apply and track them during the solution generation process.\n4. **Implement a Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm:** Consider using a constraint satisfaction algorithm (which can be implemented using deterministic Python code) to systematically search for solutions that satisfy all constraints. This will help ensure that the generated solutions are valid. The LLM would prepare the inputs for this algorithm (participant schedules, meeting duration, preferences) and then use the algorithm to generate candidate meeting times.\n5. **Implement multi-perspective analysis:** Ask the LLM to check the schedule and constraints from the perspectives of the different meeting participants to catch inconsistencies in reasoning.\n6. **Output Post-Processing and Verification:** Implement a final verification step where the LLM is asked to independently verify that the proposed meeting time satisfies all constraints and doesn't conflict with any participant's schedule.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample 0:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n- **Sample 1:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n- **Sample 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n- **Sample 3:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

The \"Available Slots:\" intro is repeated multiple times, and the ANSWER\\_START/ANSWER\\_END tags don't seem to be properly used to isolate the final answer.\n*   **Extraction Errors:** The extracted data frequently doesn't match the provided schedules in the original text. The model struggles with different formats and complexities of schedules, leading to many errors. The preferences of meeting participants are often ignored or misunderstood. For example, in sample 0 John has the preference \"Avoid Monday after 14:30, Tuesday, Wednesday\" extracted, but this is not used during the reasoning and schedule extraction.\n*   **Reasoning Errors:** Even when extraction seems relatively accurate, the identified available slots often conflict with the extracted schedules, indicating flawed logic. The system sometimes \"skips\" entire days based on preferences that could still allow for meetings at other times.\n*   **Inability to Handle Constraints:** The system fails to incorporate the constraint of meeting duration effectively. It doesn't consistently check if identified slots are long enough to accommodate the specified duration.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of the scheduling problem but struggles significantly with accuracy and reliability. It can extract some information from the input text, but the extraction is often incorrect and the subsequent reasoning is flawed. The system is not robust enough to handle variations in input format and struggles to consistently apply constraints. Overall, the system is performing poorly and needs substantial improvement.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempts Information Extraction:** The system does attempt to extract relevant data, which is a necessary first step.\n*   **Attempts to Consider Participant Schedules:** The system acknowledges the need to consider the schedules of all participants, even if it doesn't do so accurately.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** This is the MOST critical weakness. The system's inability to accurately extract schedule information renders all subsequent steps unreliable.\n*   **Poor Constraint Handling:** The system's struggles to apply constraints related to duration, time preferences, and explicit schedule conflicts significantly limit its effectiveness.\n*   **Logical Errors in Schedule Reasoning:** Flawed logic in deducing valid meeting times from extracted data.\n*   **Repetitive and Unnecessary Output:** The repetitive text in the output detracts from usability and indicates a problem with output formatting.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. Without accurate and reliable information extraction, the entire system fails.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Few-Shot Learning with Diverse Examples for Information Extraction:**\n    *   Create a set of 3-5 diverse examples demonstrating various schedule formats, preferences, and constraints.\n    *   Include examples with varying sentence structures and phrasing.\n    *   Refine the prompt to explicitly ask the LLM to double-check the extracted schedules against the original text for consistency. Add the constraint to the prompt to provide the schedule in JSON format, and only use information that is directly contained in the original text.\n    *   Ensure the examples cover cases with overlapping schedules, specific time preferences (e.g., \"avoid mornings\"), and duration constraints.\n    *   Vary the order of information presented in the examples to improve generalization.\n2.  **Implement a Verification Loop for Extracted Data (with clear error handling and re-extraction):**\n    *   Add a verification step where the system checks the extracted schedule information against the original problem statement.\n    *   Prompt the LLM to \"verify that the extracted schedule for \\[participant name] matches what is stated in the original question.\" and provide a boolean value and reason for the answer.\n    *   If discrepancies are found, trigger a re-extraction process with targeted feedback. For example, \"The extracted schedule for John is incorrect. Please re-extract the schedule based on the original text.\"\n    *   Limit the number of re-extraction attempts to prevent infinite loops.\n3.  **Model Constraints Explicitly as Data Structures:**\n    *   Represent constraints as data structures (e.g., a list of blocked time intervals for each participant).\n    *   Use named variables rather than implicit reasoning to avoid errors.\n4.  **Implement a Python Function for Constraint Satisfaction:**\n    *   Use the LLM to extract all meeting constraints, then use deterministic Python code to find all possible meeting times, then pass all possible meeting times back to the LLM to choose the optimal time.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's low accuracy (20%) and identified weaknesses indicate that the system's capabilities are currently **stable but at a low level.** There is little evidence of progress.

However, the fact that the extracted data is often incorrect, and the reasoning doesn't follow logically, suggests implicit errors in the reasoning and information processing.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n- The system attempts to extract relevant data from the problem description.\n- The system tries to consider the schedules of all participants.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n- **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** The system frequently extracts incorrect or incomplete schedule information, leading to flawed reasoning.\n- **Poor Constraint Handling:** The system struggles to accurately apply constraints related to meeting duration, preferred times, and participant preferences.\n- **Logical Errors in Schedule Reasoning:** Even with seemingly correct extracted data, the system often fails to deduce valid meeting times. The identified \"available slots\" often conflict with the extracted schedules.\n- **Repetitive and Unnecessary output:** The system repeats the intro, Available Slots: before the answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Information Extraction:** The inaccurate extraction of schedule information is the primary bottleneck, as it feeds incorrect data into the subsequent reasoning steps.\n- **Constraint Handling and Logical Reasoning:** Even when the extraction is accurate, there's a significant bottleneck in correctly applying constraints to deduce feasible meeting times.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- **Discrepancy between Extracted Schedules and \"Available Slots\":** The extracted schedules often contradict the available time slots identified by the system. This indicates a failure in the process of cross-referencing the extracted data with the constraints to derive valid solutions.\n- **Ignoring Preferences:** The system frequently fails to incorporate participant preferences (e.g., \"avoid Monday after 2 PM\") into the solution.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is **inaccurate and unreliable information extraction from the input text**. The entire scheduling logic hinges on the precise and correct extraction of participant schedules, preferences, and constraints. Because this extraction is flawed, the downstream reasoning and solution generation are rendered ineffective. The extraction is not robust enough to handle the variety and nuances present in the text.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Information Extraction:** Significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of information extraction, especially concerning participant schedules and preferences.\n- **Constraint Handling:** Improve the system's ability to accurately apply all constraints, including duration, time preferences, and explicit schedule conflicts.\n- **Logical Reasoning:** Refine the logic used to deduce valid meeting times from extracted data and applied constraints.\n- **Output Formatting:** Remove repetitive and unnecessary text in the output.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Enhance Information Extraction with Few-Shot Examples:** Use few-shot learning with multiple diverse examples to guide the LLM in extracting schedule information more accurately. Include examples with varied sentence structures and schedule formats. Refine the prompt to explicitly ask the LLM to double-check the extracted schedules against the original text for consistency.\n2. **Implement a Verification Loop for Extracted Data:** Add a verification step where the system checks the extracted schedule information against the original problem statement and flags any discrepancies for correction. This could involve prompting the LLM to \"verify that the extracted schedule for John matches what is stated in the original question.\"\n3. **Explicitly Model Constraints:** Rather than implicitly reasoning about constraints, explicitly represent them as data structures (e.g., a list of blocked time intervals for each participant). This will make it easier to apply and track them during the solution generation process.\n4. **Implement a Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm:** Consider using a constraint satisfaction algorithm (which can be implemented using deterministic Python code) to systematically search for solutions that satisfy all constraints. This will help ensure that the generated solutions are valid. The LLM would prepare the inputs for this algorithm (participant schedules, meeting duration, preferences) and then use the algorithm to generate candidate meeting times.\n5. **Implement multi-perspective analysis:** Ask the LLM to check the schedule and constraints from the perspectives of the different meeting participants to catch inconsistencies in reasoning.\n6. **Output Post-Processing and Verification:** Implement a final verification step where the LLM is asked to independently verify that the proposed meeting time satisfies all constraints and doesn't conflict with any participant's schedule.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample 0:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n- **Sample 1:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n- **Sample 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n- **Sample 3:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions by analyzing the question, extracting relevant information, generating an initial answer, and then verifying it. The problem is decomposed into four main steps: question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. Each step is handled by a specialized LLM agent with an \"expert\" role. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini LLM, and other functions are `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer`, which are called in sequence within the `main` function to process the question and refine the answer. The overall workflow involves analyzing the question, extracting information, generating an answer and verifying the answer for accuracy.",

In a symbolic gesture Mountjoy smashed the O'Neills' inauguration stone at Tullaghogue. Famine soon hit Ulster as a result of the English scorched earth strategy. O'Neill's uirithe or sub-lords  began to surrender and Rory O'Donnell, Hugh Roe's brother and successor, surrendered on terms at the end of 1602.

Elizabeth I had died on 24 March. Although the war had effectively ended with the signing of the Treaty of Mellifont, its final battles were fought during the English invasion of West Breifne in April 1603, which remained the sole holdout Irish kingdom following O'Neill's capitulation. The kingdom was ruled by Brian \u00d3g O'Rourke, one of the alliance's chief lieutenants and leader of the Irish forces during the Battle of Curlew Pass. He failed to secure any concessions from the treaty as his half-brother Tadhg O'Rourke had fought with the English during the war and was granted lordship of West Breifne in return. Following a twelve-day siege, a force of 3,000 men led by Tadhg, Henry Folliott and Rory O'Donnell eventually brought the area, and thus all of Ireland, under English control on 25 April 1603.\n\nQUESTION: Who surrendered later, Rory O'Donnell or O'Neill?",

However, with a secure base in the large and dense forests of Tir Eoghain, O'Neill held out until 30 March 1603, when he surrendered on good terms to Mountjoy, signing the Treaty of Mellifont. Elizabeth I had died on 24 March. Although the war had effectively ended with the signing of the Treaty of Mellifont, its final battles were fought during the English invasion of West Breifne in April 1603, which remained the sole holdout Irish kingdom following O'Neill's capitulation. The kingdom was ruled by Brian \u00d3g O'Rourke, one of the alliance's chief lieutenants and leader of the Irish forces during the Battle of Curlew Pass. He failed to secure any concessions from the treaty as his half-brother Tadhg O'Rourke had fought with the English during the war and was granted lordship of West Breifne in return. Following a twelve-day siege, a force of 3,000 men led by Tadhg, Henry Folliott and Rory O'Donnell eventually brought the area, and thus all of Ireland, under English control on 25 April 1603.",

However, its performance is significantly hindered by a lack of deep semantic understanding, particularly regarding negation and contextual reasoning.

These tests should cover:\n    *   Explicit negation (e.g., \"not,\" \"never\")\n    *   Implicit negation (e.g., \"except,\" \"without\")\n    *   Negation within complex sentences\n\n3.  **Enhance Logging for Numerical Reasoning:** Implement more detailed logging within the numerical reasoning module to track:\n    *   All numerical values extracted from the passage.\n    *   The context associated with each numerical value.\n    *   The reasoning process used to select the correct numerical value for a given question.\n    *   The confidence score for the selected value.\n\n4.  **Introduce a Question Decomposition Step:** Before attempting to extract information or perform calculations, decompose the question into simpler sub-questions.

While it demonstrates some basic skills, it struggles with more complex tasks requiring deeper semantic understanding.

  "approach_summary": "This script uses an LLM-driven approach with chain-of-thought reasoning to solve meeting scheduling problems by extracting constraints, finding available time slots, and verifying the proposed solution. The problem is decomposed into three main steps: constraint extraction, time slot finding, and solution verification. Three different agent roles are used: constraint extractor, time slot finder, and solution checker, each leveraging the LLM with specific instructions and examples.",

      "text_report": "## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Correctly identifies participants, duration, and days:** The system consistently extracts this information accurately from the problem statement.\n2.  **Identifies busy slots accurately:** The system is generally good at identifying the busy slots for each participant, though it sometimes misses edge cases or misinterprets ranges.\n3.  **Systematically checks for availability:** The system often iterates through potential time slots and checks for conflicts with each participant's schedule.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inconsistent time slot availability reasoning:** The system frequently makes errors in reasoning about overlapping time intervals, particularly when determining whether a time slot is long enough to accommodate the meeting duration. There's often miscalculation around start and end times.\n2.  **Failure to consistently apply the \"earliest availability\" constraint:** The system often identifies *a* valid time, but not necessarily the *earliest* valid time. This is especially pronounced when multiple participants have complex overlapping schedules.\n3.  **Logic errors in checking for overlapping busy times**: The system's code struggles with correctly checking if a given time slot overlaps with the existing schedule, leading to missed valid slots, or incorrect selection of busy slots.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Error-prone time interval reasoning:** The system's primary bottleneck is the unreliable logic for determining time slot availability given participant schedules. This involves checking for overlaps, ensuring the duration fits within available windows, and identifying the *earliest* such window. This is due to fragile, rule-based comparison of strings that represent the schedules instead of reasoning about the schedules with LLMs.\n2.  **Lack of a robust solution verification step:** The system needs a separate solution verification step where the proposed time slot is explicitly checked against *all* constraints *after* the initial search.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Off-by-one errors in time calculations:** Small errors in adding or subtracting time intervals lead to incorrect availability calculations. For example, miscalculating end times based on meeting duration.\n2.  **Incorrectly concluding \"no suitable time slot\":** The system frequently gives up prematurely, missing available slots. Often this follows an initial miscalculation which skews the subsequent search.\n3.  **Selection of later, not earliest, time slots:** A pattern is that the algorithm finds a valid time, but overlooks earlier valid times.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **unreliable time interval reasoning**. The LLM parsing and reasoning about the schedule in plain text is brittle, and the manual logic for overlap detection and time window calculation is prone to errors. The system relies on the LLM to extract relevant information and busy schedules, but then attempts to apply flawed, rule-based checks.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Enhance Time Interval Reasoning:** The ability to accurately calculate available time slots based on the given constrains.\n2.  **Robust Solution Verification:** The ability to verify if the generated solution satisfies all the given constrains.\n3.  **Constraint Satisfaction Logic:** Ensure the algorithm comprehensively checks for all available valid time slots and can identify the *earliest*.\n4.  **Prioritization of Constraints:** The capability to accurately apply preference-based constraints (e.g., \"avoid Mondays\") while still finding the earliest possible time.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace String Comparison with Interval Arithmetic:** Instead of relying on string comparisons for time slots, represent schedules as a list of time intervals (start_time, end_time) and use interval arithmetic to determine overlap.\n2.  **Implement a Solution Verifier Agent**: Create a separate agent whose sole job is to *verify* the final proposed solution. This agent will take the problem, the extracted constraints, and the proposed time, and then use a specific LLM prompt to confirm whether all constraints are met. This will allow the main solution agent to focus on *finding* candidate times.\n3.  **Use an LLM to reason about overlapping busy times** Instead of relying on a brittle function to calculate overlapping busy times, make an LLM call to reason about this, returning true or false, and its reasoning.\n4.  **Explicit Earliest Time Tracking**: Maintain a variable to track the earliest valid time found so far. Initialize it to the end of the day (17:00), and update it whenever a valid time slot is found that's earlier than the current value.\n5.  **Multi-Agent Refinement Loop**: If the Solution Verifier detects a constraint violation, send the problem, the failed solution, and the verifier's feedback back to the Solution Generator to refine its answer. Iterate this loop until a valid solution is found.\n6.  **Reinforce \"Earliest Time\" Emphasis in Prompts**: Add specific phrases to prompts like \"Ensure you find the *absolute earliest* possible meeting time\", or \"Your highest priority is to find the first available slot that satisfies all conditions\".\n7.  **Implement Constraint-aware Exploration**: Instead of randomly checking times, guide the search by the constraints. Focus the search on times immediately *after* busy slots, as these are more likely to be the earliest available.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 5:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: The model didn't choose the earliest available time.\n    *   solution\\_verification: The model failed to verify that the chosen time was the earliest available, given Patricia's preference.\n*   **Sample 6:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 7:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 8:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 11:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n*   **Sample 13:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 19:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 23:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed to handle the constraint \"Wayne would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 16:00\".\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 24:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to identify the earliest possible time slot and incorrectly concludes no solution exists.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Didn't verify the earliest availability.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Correctly identifies participants, duration, and days:** The system consistently extracts this information accurately from the problem statement.\n2.  **Identifies busy slots accurately:** The system is generally good at identifying the busy slots for each participant, though it sometimes misses edge cases or misinterprets ranges.\n3.  **Systematically checks for availability:** The system often iterates through potential time slots and checks for conflicts with each participant's schedule.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inconsistent time slot availability reasoning:** The system frequently makes errors in reasoning about overlapping time intervals, particularly when determining whether a time slot is long enough to accommodate the meeting duration. There's often miscalculation around start and end times.\n2.  **Failure to consistently apply the \"earliest availability\" constraint:** The system often identifies *a* valid time, but not necessarily the *earliest* valid time. This is especially pronounced when multiple participants have complex overlapping schedules.\n3.  **Logic errors in checking for overlapping busy times**: The system's code struggles with correctly checking if a given time slot overlaps with the existing schedule, leading to missed valid slots, or incorrect selection of busy slots.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Error-prone time interval reasoning:** The system's primary bottleneck is the unreliable logic for determining time slot availability given participant schedules. This involves checking for overlaps, ensuring the duration fits within available windows, and identifying the *earliest* such window. This is due to fragile, rule-based comparison of strings that represent the schedules instead of reasoning about the schedules with LLMs.\n2.  **Lack of a robust solution verification step:** The system needs a separate solution verification step where the proposed time slot is explicitly checked against *all* constraints *after* the initial search.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Off-by-one errors in time calculations:** Small errors in adding or subtracting time intervals lead to incorrect availability calculations. For example, miscalculating end times based on meeting duration.\n2.  **Incorrectly concluding \"no suitable time slot\":** The system frequently gives up prematurely, missing available slots. Often this follows an initial miscalculation which skews the subsequent search.\n3.  **Selection of later, not earliest, time slots:** A pattern is that the algorithm finds a valid time, but overlooks earlier valid times.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **unreliable time interval reasoning**. The LLM parsing and reasoning about the schedule in plain text is brittle, and the manual logic for overlap detection and time window calculation is prone to errors. The system relies on the LLM to extract relevant information and busy schedules, but then attempts to apply flawed, rule-based checks.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Enhance Time Interval Reasoning:** The ability to accurately calculate available time slots based on the given constrains.\n2.  **Robust Solution Verification:** The ability to verify if the generated solution satisfies all the given constrains.\n3.  **Constraint Satisfaction Logic:** Ensure the algorithm comprehensively checks for all available valid time slots and can identify the *earliest*.\n4.  **Prioritization of Constraints:** The capability to accurately apply preference-based constraints (e.g., \"avoid Mondays\") while still finding the earliest possible time.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace String Comparison with Interval Arithmetic:** Instead of relying on string comparisons for time slots, represent schedules as a list of time intervals (start_time, end_time) and use interval arithmetic to determine overlap.\n2.  **Implement a Solution Verifier Agent**: Create a separate agent whose sole job is to *verify* the final proposed solution. This agent will take the problem, the extracted constraints, and the proposed time, and then use a specific LLM prompt to confirm whether all constraints are met. This will allow the main solution agent to focus on *finding* candidate times.\n3.  **Use an LLM to reason about overlapping busy times** Instead of relying on a brittle function to calculate overlapping busy times, make an LLM call to reason about this, returning true or false, and its reasoning.\n4.  **Explicit Earliest Time Tracking**: Maintain a variable to track the earliest valid time found so far. Initialize it to the end of the day (17:00), and update it whenever a valid time slot is found that's earlier than the current value.\n5.  **Multi-Agent Refinement Loop**: If the Solution Verifier detects a constraint violation, send the problem, the failed solution, and the verifier's feedback back to the Solution Generator to refine its answer. Iterate this loop until a valid solution is found.\n6.  **Reinforce \"Earliest Time\" Emphasis in Prompts**: Add specific phrases to prompts like \"Ensure you find the *absolute earliest* possible meeting time\", or \"Your highest priority is to find the first available slot that satisfies all conditions\".\n7.  **Implement Constraint-aware Exploration**: Instead of randomly checking times, guide the search by the constraints. Focus the search on times immediately *after* busy slots, as these are more likely to be the earliest available.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 5:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: The model didn't choose the earliest available time.\n    *   solution\\_verification: The model failed to verify that the chosen time was the earliest available, given Patricia's preference.\n*   **Sample 6:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 7:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 8:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 11:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n*   **Sample 13:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 19:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: The model was not able to reason about all possible availabilities.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 23:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed to handle the constraint \"Wayne would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 16:00\".\n    *   solution\\_verification: Did not verify the earliest availability.\n*   **Sample 24:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to identify the earliest possible time slot and incorrectly concludes no solution exists.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Didn't verify the earliest availability.\n",

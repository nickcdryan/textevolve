  "approach_summary": "The script uses the Gemini LLM to solve grid transformation problems by learning from examples and directly generating the output grid. The problem is decomposed into transforming the test grid and validating the output format. The LLM acts as a grid transformer and a grid validator, guided by system instructions and prompts. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini API, `transform_test_grid` transforms the grid based on training examples, and `validate_grid_format` validates if the output is a list of lists containing only numbers. The overall workflow involves transforming the grid using the LLM, validating the format of the transformed grid using the LLM, and returning the transformed grid if valid.",

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage approach with LLMs to answer questions. It decomposes the problem into determining the question type, extracting relevant information, and generating the final answer. Three agent roles are used implicitly: a question type classifier, an information extractor, and an answer generator. The functions used are `main`, `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, `generate_answer`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `determine_question_type` to get the type, then `extract_relevant_info` using the determined type, and finally `generate_answer` to produce the answer, leveraging `call_llm` in each step to interact with the LLM.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze   was a Georgian nobleman and King of Imereti as George VI  from 1702 to 1707. He was a member of the prominent Abashidze family. The youngest son of Prince Paata Abashidze, he was served as a priest until about 1684 when he entered politics after the death of his elder brother Paata Abashidze and began aggressively expanding his patrimonial fiefdom. He dispossessed the Chkheidze family of Shorapani, and the Agiashvili of Tsutskhvati, and took control of the royal domain in Upper Imereti. His daughter, Tamar, was married to the two successive kings of Imereti, Alexander IV and George V. During the reign of the latter monarch, Abashidze effectively ran the government and acted as an all-powerful kingmaker. In 1699, he gave his daughter Anika in marriage to King Simon of Imereti, but they divorced in 1700. In 1701, Abashidze compelled King Mamia of Imereti to abdicate and seized the throne for himself. He managed to establish a degree of stability in Imereti and ceased to pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire, triggering a military response in 1703. He also patronized culture and learning. Deposed after a revolt by the nobles, in favour of the rightful Bagrationi king George VII, Abashidze took refuge at the court of Vakhtang VI of Kartli in Tbilisi. He died there in 1722, and was buried in the Katskhi monastery in Imereti.\n\nQUESTION: How many years after leaving the throne did Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze die?",

The Tokara Islands and the northwestern group of the \u014csumi Islands belonged to Kawanabe District of Satsuma Province. The Amami Islands paid tribute to the Ryukyu Kingdom to the South until they were put under direct control in the late 16th century, but were conquered in 1609 by the Satsuma Domain.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Rookie cornerback Jason Verrett intercepted Oakland Raiders rookie quarterback Derek Carr at the San Diego 5 with 1:13 remaining in the game to seal a 31-28 Chargers win on the road. San Diego had gone ahead with 1:56 to play on a 1-yard touchdown run by Oliver. Verrett's first career interception helped the Chargers extend their winning streak to five, while Oakland suffered its 11th straight defeat. The Chargers 5-1 start to begin the season was their best since 2002. Carr threw a 77-yard TD pass to Andre Holmes in the opening minute of the game, and he and Rivers both threw two touchdowns in the first half for a 14-14 tie at halftime. In the third quarter, a 54-yard Novak field goal was nullified by a Chargers holding penalty. On fourth-and-35, Weddle threw an incomplete pass on a fake punt, giving the Raiders excellent field position; Oakland then scored on a 47-yard TD pass from Carr to Brice Butler. The Chargers responded with a Gates score on a 1-yard pass from Rivers, and the game was tied at 21 to begin the fourth quarter. Oakland took the lead again after Carr found Holmes for a 6-yard TD with 10 minutes left. On the following possession, Rivers completed the first four passes for 70 yards, which led to a 30-yard field goal by Novak. The Chargers defense forced a three-and-out, when Allen&#8212;filling in for an injured Royal&#8212;returned the punt 29 yards to the Oakland 39. With 4:49 remaining, Rivers led the six-play game-winning TD drive which culminated with four straight runs by Oliver for 29 yards. The Raiders had the ball on the Chargers 45 on second-and-one, when Carr threw deep for Butler, but Verrett leaped for an acrobatic sideline interception. Verrett had left the game earlier in the third quarter after tearing his left labrum in three places while diving for a pass. Oliver ran for 101 yards in the game, and Rivers threw for 313 yards and three touchdowns. For Rivers, it was an NFL-record fifth straight game with at least a 120 passer rating. Verrett grew up a Raiders fan in nearby Fairfield, California. About 100 of his friends and family attended the game, including his brother, who works for the Raiders.\n\nQUESTION: Who was injured",

The youngest son of Prince Paata Abashidze, he was served as a priest until about 1684 when he entered politics after the death of his elder brother Paata Abashidze and began aggressively expanding his patrimonial fiefdom. He dispossessed the Chkheidze family of Shorapani, and the Agiashvili of Tsutskhvati, and took control of the royal domain in Upper Imereti. His daughter, Tamar, was married to the two successive kings of Imereti, Alexander IV and George V. During the reign of the latter monarch, Abashidze effectively ran the government and acted as an all-powerful kingmaker. In 1699, he gave his daughter Anika in marriage to King Simon of Imereti, but they divorced in 1700. In 1701, Abashidze compelled King Mamia of Imereti to abdicate and seized the throne for himself. He managed to establish a degree of stability in Imereti and ceased to pay tribute to the Ottoman Empire, triggering a military response in 1703. He also patronized culture and learning. Deposed after a revolt by the nobles, in favour of the rightful Bagrationi king George VII, Abashidze took refuge at the court of Vakhtang VI of Kartli in Tbilisi.

San Diego had gone ahead with 1:56 to play on a 1-yard touchdown run by Oliver. Verrett's first career interception helped the Chargers extend their winning streak to five, while Oakland suffered its 11th straight defeat. The Chargers 5-1 start to begin the season was their best since 2002. Carr threw a 77-yard TD pass to Andre Holmes in the opening minute of the game, and he and Rivers both threw two touchdowns in the first half for a 14-14 tie at halftime. In the third quarter, a 54-yard Novak field goal was nullified by a Chargers holding penalty. On fourth-and-35, Weddle threw an incomplete pass on a fake punt, giving the Raiders excellent field position; Oakland then scored on a 47-yard TD pass from Carr to Brice Butler. The Chargers responded with a Gates score on a 1-yard pass from Rivers, and the game was tied at 21 to begin the fourth quarter. Oakland took the lead again after Carr found Holmes for a 6-yard TD with 10 minutes left. On the following possession, Rivers completed the first four passes for 70 yards, which led to a 30-yard field goal by Novak.

With 4:49 remaining, Rivers led the six-play game-winning TD drive which culminated with four straight runs by Oliver for 29 yards. The Raiders had the ball on the Chargers 45 on second-and-one, when Carr threw deep for Butler, but Verrett leaped for an acrobatic sideline interception. Verrett had left the game earlier in the third quarter after tearing his left labrum in three places while diving for a pass. Oliver ran for 101 yards in the game, and Rivers threw for 313 yards and three touchdowns. For Rivers, it was an NFL-record fifth straight game with at least a 120 passer rating.

However, without the question or ground truth, it's impossible to verify if the extracted value is correct in the context of the question.\n*   **Output 2:** The output `ANSWER_START\\n1 yard\\n\\nANSWER_END\\n` demonstrates the previously highlighted issue of including units when only the numerical value might be required. It indicates a lack of understanding regarding the specific needs of the query and an over-reliance on verbatim extraction.\n*   **Output 3:** The output `ANSWER_START\\n15 years\\n\\nANSWER_END\\n` reinforces the pattern of returning numerical values with units. It is crucial to understand whether the question requires only \"15\" or \"15 years\".\n\nThese sample outputs highlight the pressing need for refining answer formatting and context awareness.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the AI system exhibits a rudimentary capability for information extraction and simple numerical processing. However, its ability to provide correct and contextually appropriate answers is hampered by limitations in semantic understanding, temporal reasoning, and answer formatting. The system demonstrates the *ability* to extract information but struggles with the *understanding* of what to extract and *how* to format it for optimal usability.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Numerical Value Extraction:** The system can locate and extract numerical values from text, a fundamental requirement for many analytical tasks.\n*   **Rudimentary Comparative Reasoning:** The system displays some basic ability to identify greater/lesser relationships.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Unit Handling:** Incorrectly including units in numerical answers when they are not needed.\n*   **Temporal Reasoning:** Difficulty understanding and processing relative temporal references.\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** Misidentifying/mistaking information critical to answering the question.\n*   **Lack of Semantic Understanding**: Failure to identify context and understand the question.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **unit handling and semantic answer formatting**. Addressing this weakness will directly improve answer accuracy and relevance across various question types. It's the most readily addressable issue with a high potential for immediate impact.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Post-Processing Unit Removal (Priority: High):**\n    *   Develop a rule-based or machine learning-based module to identify and remove units from numerical answers unless the question explicitly requests them.\n    *   Start with a simple regular expression-based approach, targeting common units (e.g., \"years,\" \"yards,\" \"miles,\" \"%\") and refining the module based on error analysis.\n    *   Create a training dataset of questions paired with ideal answer formats (with and without units) and fine-tune a smaller model to predict if the unit is needed.\n2.  **Enhance Temporal Reference Resolution (Priority: Medium):**\n    *   Develop a temporal reasoning module that identifies temporal references (e.g., \"two weeks prior,\" \"next month\") and resolves them to specific dates within the context of the passage.\n    *   Begin by identifying anchor dates in the passage (explicitly stated dates) and calculating offsets from these anchors.\n3.  **Improve Information Extraction by using Keyword association (Priority: Medium):**\n    *   Develop Keyword Association by assigning each keyword to it's respective entity. For example, keyword `injured` can be assigned to the injured entity.\n4. **Question Contextualization and Semantic Understanding (Priority: High)**\n    * Develop a module for contextual analysis to identify the question's requirements.\n    * Add a rule-based system that takes in the results of this module and checks if the answer aligns with the question's requirements.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, it is difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. The system demonstrates some fundamental capabilities but is significantly hindered by its inability to handle units and temporal reasoning correctly. The trend is currently **stable but low**. Implementing the recommended improvements will be essential to initiate an upward trend. Further iteration and improvements will increase capabilities.\n",

Addressing this weakness will directly improve answer accuracy and relevance across various question types. It's the most readily addressable issue with a high potential for immediate impact.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Post-Processing Unit Removal (Priority: High):**\n    *   Develop a rule-based or machine learning-based module to identify and remove units from numerical answers unless the question explicitly requests them.\n    *   Start with a simple regular expression-based approach, targeting common units (e.g., \"years,\" \"yards,\" \"miles,\" \"%\") and refining the module based on error analysis.\n    *   Create a training dataset of questions paired with ideal answer formats (with and without units) and fine-tune a smaller model to predict if the unit is needed.\n2.  **Enhance Temporal Reference Resolution (Priority: Medium):**\n    *   Develop a temporal reasoning module that identifies temporal references (e.g., \"two weeks prior,\" \"next month\") and resolves them to specific dates within the context of the passage.\n    *   Begin by identifying anchor dates in the passage (explicitly stated dates) and calculating offsets from these anchors.\n3.  **Improve Information Extraction by using Keyword association (Priority: Medium):**\n    *   Develop Keyword Association by assigning each keyword to it's respective entity. For example, keyword `injured` can be assigned to the injured entity.\n4. **Question Contextualization and Semantic Understanding (Priority: High)**\n    * Develop a module for contextual analysis to identify the question's requirements.\n    * Add a rule-based system that takes in the results of this module and checks if the answer aligns with the question's requirements.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, it is difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. The system demonstrates some fundamental capabilities but is significantly hindered by its inability to handle units and temporal reasoning correctly. The trend is currently **stable but low**. Implementing the recommended improvements will be essential to initiate an upward trend. Further iteration and improvements will increase capabilities.\n"

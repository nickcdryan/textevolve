  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with multiple LLM calls to schedule a meeting, breaking the problem into participant extraction, constraint extraction, solution finding, and solution verification. Specialized agents are created using function calls to extract participants (`extract_participants`), extract constraints (`extract_constraints`), solve the scheduling problem (`solve_meeting_problem`), and verify the solution (`verify_solution`). The `main` function orchestrates these calls to produce a meeting schedule or an error message based on the LLM output. The overall workflow involves extracting information, finding a solution, verifying that solution, and returning an appropriate response.",

In Sample ID 0, the system correctly identified the constraints, but incorrectly assessed Martha's availability at 9:00 on Monday, overlooking that Martha is only busy 9:30-11:00 and Jesse is available 9-9:30. The system then terminates once a \"potential slot\" at 12:30 is found.\n\nIn Sample ID 2, the system quickly determines that Laura is unavailable on Tuesday and fails to evaluate the rest of that day or Wednesday, even though Laura's constraint is a preference and not a hard rule. It also fails to notice the potential availability between 11:00-11:30 on Monday. In sample ID 3 the system identifies the correct answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of scheduling constraints and can break down the problem into smaller steps.

The system is capable of correctly identifying constraints and structuring the solution process but is inconsistent at executing the availability checks thoroughly.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Approach:** The system's ability to break down the scheduling problem into smaller, manageable steps provides a solid foundation.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** Accurate identification and documentation of constraints is crucial for solving these problems.\n* **Understands Relative Preferences:** In sample ID 3 it showed an understanding of the constraints to allow for better time management and efficiency\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inconsistent Availability Checking:** The system frequently misidentifies available time slots due to flawed logic and incomplete evaluation.\n*   **Premature Termination:** The system prematurely terminates its search for solutions, missing earlier and potentially better options.\n*   **Lack of Exhaustive Search:** The system lacks a systematic and exhaustive search strategy to ensure that all possible time slots are considered.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Inconsistent Availability Checking**. Addressing this will have the most significant impact on overall accuracy and solution quality.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Exhaustive Availability Checking:** Replace the current ad-hoc approach with a systematic, exhaustive algorithm that checks *every* possible time slot in chronological order. For each slot, explicitly verify that *all* participants are available. This is the most critical change.\n2.  **Develop a Detailed Availability Matrix:** Before starting the search, create an explicit availability matrix for each participant, indicating their availability for every 30-minute slot on each day. This will simplify and improve the accuracy of availability checks.  The matrix could be represented as a data structure in code.\n3.  **Integrate Solution Verification with Backtracking:** After finding a potential solution, implement a verification step that *backtracks* to check whether any earlier time slots are also available. If earlier slots are found, update the solution accordingly. This will help prevent premature termination.\n4.  **Refine Preference Handling:** Clarify and strengthen the system's handling of preferences (e.g., Carl's desire to avoid Tuesdays and Wednesdays). Ensure that preferences are considered only *after* exhausting all possibilities that satisfy the hard constraints.\n5.  **Add Unit Tests Focused on Edge Cases:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically designed to test the availability checking logic. Include test cases that cover a wide range of edge cases and complex scheduling scenarios.  Focus on input examples where a participant is only busy for a very short period of time within the scheduling window.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **stable**, but leaning towards negative if the core issue of availability checking is not addressed.

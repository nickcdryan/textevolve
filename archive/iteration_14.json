  "approach_summary": "The script implements a question-answering system using chain-of-thought reasoning, where the problem is decomposed into sub-questions, information extraction, and answer synthesis. It employs three distinct agent roles: a question decomposer, an information extraction expert, and an answer synthesis expert, each responsible for a specific stage of the process. The functions `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, and `synthesize_answer` use the `call_llm` function to interact with the LLM, and each function also validates its results with the LLM before proceeding to the next stage. The overall workflow involves decomposing the initial question, extracting relevant information to answer sub-questions, synthesizing these answers into a final response, and then returning the final answer.",

It was a result of the 1750 Treaty of Madrid, which set a line of demarcation between Spanish and Portuguese colonial territory in South America. The boundary drawn up between the two nations was the Uruguay River, with Portugal possessing the land east of the river. The seven Jesuit missions east of the Uruguay River, known as the Misiones Orientales, were to be dismantled and relocated on the Spanish western side of the river. The seven missions were called San Miguel, Santos Angeles, San Lorenzo Martir, San Nicolas, San Juan Bautista, San Luis Gonzaga, and San Francisco de Borja. These missions were some of the most populous in South America with 26,362 inhabitants, according to a Jesuit census, and many more in the surrounding areas. In 1754 the Jesuits surrendered control of the missions, but the Guarani led by Sep\u00e9 Tiaraju, refused to comply with the order to relocate. Efforts by the Spanish army in 1754 to forcefully remove the Guarani from the missions failed. On February 10, 1756, a combined force of 3,000 Spanish and Portuguese soldiers fought the Guaran\u00ed at the battle of Caiboat\u00e9. It resulted in the death of 1,511 Guarani, while the Europeans suffered only 4 deaths. In the aftermath of the battle, the joint Spanish-Portuguese army occupied the seven missions.

It was a result of the 1750 Treaty of Madrid, which set a line of demarcation between Spanish and Portuguese colonial territory in South America. The boundary drawn up between the two nations was the Uruguay River, with Portugal possessing the land east of the river. The seven Jesuit missions east of the Uruguay River, known as the Misiones Orientales, were to be dismantled and relocated on the Spanish western side of the river. The seven missions were called San Miguel, Santos Angeles, San Lorenzo Martir, San Nicolas, San Juan Bautista, San Luis Gonzaga, and San Francisco de Borja. These missions were some of the most populous in South America with 26,362 inhabitants, according to a Jesuit census, and many more in the surrounding areas. In 1754 the Jesuits surrendered control of the missions, but the Guarani led by Sep\u00e9 Tiaraju, refused to comply with the order to relocate. Efforts by the Spanish army in 1754 to forcefully remove the Guarani from the missions failed. On February 10, 1756, a combined force of 3,000 Spanish and Portuguese soldiers fought the Guaran\u00ed at the battle of Caiboat\u00e9. It resulted in the death of 1,511 Guarani, while the Europeans suffered only 4 deaths. In the aftermath of the battle, the joint Spanish-Portuguese army occupied the seven missions. Eventually Spain and Portugal annulled the 1750 treaty in the Treaty of El Pardo , with Spain regaining control over the seven missions and its surrounding territory.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability assessment report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and other considerations:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs confirm the Error Analysis Report. Specifically:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (France and Germany):** The output correctly identifies countries, but it fails to adhere to the \"more than one date\" constraint. This reflects the weakness in complex information extraction and filtering. The fact that countries *were* identified at all shows a partial capability, but the filtering component clearly failed. The output included both countries regardless of whether their schedules matched the criteria. This highlights a breakdown in filtering logic.\n*   **Sample ID 3 (1,515):** This output is an incorrect numerical answer, consistent with the identified weaknesses in arithmetic reasoning. The output reflects the total number of yards thrown (1515) in the provided context rather than the difference between field goal lengths (53 and 51 yards). This suggests the system may not have even attempted to calculate the difference, or perhaps it extracted incorrect values in the first place.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits a baseline capability for information extraction and question answering, particularly when questions are straightforward. However, its capabilities degrade significantly when questions involve complex filtering criteria or require arithmetic operations on extracted values. The most pressing problem is the system's inability to accurately combine information extraction with arithmetic reasoning. This significantly limits its applicability to real-world scenarios where questions often require both.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction:** The system can extract entities and facts from the given context when the extraction criteria are straightforward.\n*   **Question Understanding:** The system can generally understand the intent of the questions, even if it sometimes fails to answer them correctly.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complex Information Filtering:**  The system struggles to accurately filter extracted information based on multiple conditions and constraints, resulting in extraneous or irrelevant information being included in the answer.\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning with Extracted Data:** The system exhibits significant weaknesses in performing accurate arithmetic operations on values extracted from the text.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Complex Information Filtering**.  While arithmetic reasoning is important, it's predicated on the system first being able to accurately extract the relevant information to perform those calculations on. If the input data is incorrect, the calculation will inevitably be wrong, no matter how precise the calculation itself is.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Stage Filtering Process:**  Break down the filtering process into multiple, explicit stages. This will allow for more targeted error analysis and debugging. For example:\n    *   *Stage 1: Initial Extraction:* Extract all entities of the required type (e.g., all countries).\n    *   *Stage 2: Condition Evaluation:* Evaluate each extracted entity against each constraint in the question. Use Boolean logic to represent whether each condition is met for each entity.\n    *   *Stage 3: Final Filtering:*  Select only the entities that satisfy *all* the conditions.\n2.  **Integrate Dependency Parsing:** Use dependency parsing to understand the grammatical relationships between words in the question and the passage. This can help the system to better identify the constraints and their scope. Focus especially on understanding how quantifiers (e.g., \"more than one\") apply to different parts of the question.\n3.  **Develop Unit Tests for the Filtering Module:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically designed to test the filtering module in isolation. These tests should cover a range of scenarios with varying complexity and different types of constraints.\n4.  **Data Augmentation for Filtering:** Augment the training data with more examples that specifically target complex filtering scenarios. These examples should be designed to challenge the system's ability to identify and apply constraints. Generate synthetic data if necessary.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the error analysis and execution outputs, the system shows a stable, but inadequate performance level. Without focused improvements, the system will likely continue to struggle with questions requiring combined information extraction, filtering and arithmetic reasoning. Implementing the actionable recommendations should, in the next iteration, show a positive trend in information extraction capabilities, leading to improvements in arithmetic reasoning.\n",

This might involve using dependency parsing to better understand the relationships between words in the question and passage.\n2.  **Develop a dedicated arithmetic reasoning module:** Implement a separate module specifically for handling arithmetic operations. This module should be able to identify the relevant numbers, understand the required operation, and perform the calculation accurately. Add unit tests to specifically evaluate this module.\n3.  **Detailed Logging:** For debugging, include a more granular logging system that captures each step of the reasoning process. This would involve logging information about what keywords are being identified, how it's filtering the information, the extracted numeric data, and the operations it is performing.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making. The system extracted the countries scheduled but failed to filter by \"more than one date\" accurately, and so the final answer was incorrect.\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making. The system successfully extracted the relevant field goal lengths, but it incorrectly calculated the difference.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability assessment report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and other considerations:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs confirm the Error Analysis Report. Specifically:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (France and Germany):** The output correctly identifies countries, but it fails to adhere to the \"more than one date\" constraint. This reflects the weakness in complex information extraction and filtering. The fact that countries *were* identified at all shows a partial capability, but the filtering component clearly failed. The output included both countries regardless of whether their schedules matched the criteria. This highlights a breakdown in filtering logic.\n*   **Sample ID 3 (1,515):** This output is an incorrect numerical answer, consistent with the identified weaknesses in arithmetic reasoning. The output reflects the total number of yards thrown (1515) in the provided context rather than the difference between field goal lengths (53 and 51 yards). This suggests the system may not have even attempted to calculate the difference, or perhaps it extracted incorrect values in the first place.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits a baseline capability for information extraction and question answering, particularly when questions are straightforward. However, its capabilities degrade significantly when questions involve complex filtering criteria or require arithmetic operations on extracted values. The most pressing problem is the system's inability to accurately combine information extraction with arithmetic reasoning. This significantly limits its applicability to real-world scenarios where questions often require both.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction:** The system can extract entities and facts from the given context when the extraction criteria are straightforward.\n*   **Question Understanding:** The system can generally understand the intent of the questions, even if it sometimes fails to answer them correctly.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complex Information Filtering:**  The system struggles to accurately filter extracted information based on multiple conditions and constraints, resulting in extraneous or irrelevant information being included in the answer.\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning with Extracted Data:** The system exhibits significant weaknesses in performing accurate arithmetic operations on values extracted from the text.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Complex Information Filtering**.  While arithmetic reasoning is important, it's predicated on the system first being able to accurately extract the relevant information to perform those calculations on. If the input data is incorrect, the calculation will inevitably be wrong, no matter how precise the calculation itself is.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Stage Filtering Process:**  Break down the filtering process into multiple, explicit stages. This will allow for more targeted error analysis and debugging. For example:\n    *   *Stage 1: Initial Extraction:* Extract all entities of the required type (e.g., all countries).\n    *   *Stage 2: Condition Evaluation:* Evaluate each extracted entity against each constraint in the question. Use Boolean logic to represent whether each condition is met for each entity.\n    *   *Stage 3: Final Filtering:*  Select only the entities that satisfy *all* the conditions.\n2.  **Integrate Dependency Parsing:** Use dependency parsing to understand the grammatical relationships between words in the question and the passage. This can help the system to better identify the constraints and their scope. Focus especially on understanding how quantifiers (e.g., \"more than one\") apply to different parts of the question.\n3.  **Develop Unit Tests for the Filtering Module:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically designed to test the filtering module in isolation. These tests should cover a range of scenarios with varying complexity and different types of constraints.\n4.  **Data Augmentation for Filtering:** Augment the training data with more examples that specifically target complex filtering scenarios. These examples should be designed to challenge the system's ability to identify and apply constraints. Generate synthetic data if necessary.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the error analysis and execution outputs, the system shows a stable, but inadequate performance level. Without focused improvements, the system will likely continue to struggle with questions requiring combined information extraction, filtering and arithmetic reasoning. Implementing the actionable recommendations should, in the next iteration, show a positive trend in information extraction capabilities, leading to improvements in arithmetic reasoning.\n"

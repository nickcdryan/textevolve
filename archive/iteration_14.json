  "approach_summary": "The script employs LLM-driven rule extraction, refinement, and application to solve grid transformation problems. It decomposes the problem into extracting a transformation rule from examples, refining the rule, and then applying it to a test input. There are three agent roles: an expert grid transformation expert (for `rule_extraction`), an expert grid transformation agent (for `refine_rule` and `apply_rule`). The functions used are `rule_extraction` (extracts transformation rules), `refine_rule` (refines the extracted rule), `apply_rule` (applies the refined rule), `call_llm` (calls the LLM), and `main` (orchestrates the process). The workflow involves `main` calling `rule_extraction`, then `refine_rule`, and finally `apply_rule` to generate the transformed grid, using `call_llm` to interact with the LLM in each step.",

The generated code in Error Case 2 seems to make the grid more different from the test grid than it should be.\n2.  **Incorrect Output Format/Size**: The generated output grids in Error Case 1 have an incorrect size, indicating an issue with the transformation and output generation logic. In the training examples, the desired output is always a significantly smaller grid than the input, which the model fails to grasp.\n3.  **Number Identification and Replacement:** The model sometimes grabs the right number to work with (4 in Error Case 1 instead of 6), but then uses it to fill an incorrectly sized grid.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Generalization of Transformation Rules**: The system struggles to generalize the transformation rules from the training examples and apply them accurately to new inputs.\n2.  **Output Generation Logic**: The output generation process is flawed, leading to incorrect grid sizes and element placement.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Grid Size**: The system produces output grids with sizes different from those in the golden answers, indicating a failure in understanding the appropriate output dimensions.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Transformation Rules**: The transformations applied to the input grid are inconsistent and do not follow the patterns established in the training examples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **inability to accurately generalize and apply transformation rules from training examples to test inputs**, leading to incorrect output grids in terms of both size and content. The system struggles to translate observed patterns into a robust algorithm for manipulating the grid. It seems like there might be a lack of connection between the input and output grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Transformation Rule Extraction**: Improve the system's ability to extract accurate transformation rules from training examples.\n2.  **Output Generation Logic**: Refine the output generation logic to ensure the correct grid size and element placement.\n3.  **Constraint Handling:** The model should be better at handling constraints related to grid dimensions and element values.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a dedicated module for analyzing training examples**: This module would specifically identify patterns and relationships between input and output grids, such as element mappings, spatial transformations, and grid size changes.\n2.  **Refine the code generation logic**: Instead of directly generating code that manipulates the grid, consider a two-step approach. First, generate a symbolic representation of the transformation rules. Second, translate this symbolic representation into executable code. This may require a new data structure.\n3.  **Add constraints to the output generation**: Implement constraints that ensure the output grid adheres to the expected dimensions and value ranges based on the training data.\n4.  **Augment the training data**: Include more diverse training examples that cover a wider range of transformation rules and grid sizes.\n5.  **Debugging with Intermediate Outputs:** Implement print statements throughout the code that shows the output of intermediate steps in the model. This allows us to observe the state of key variables and data structures and determine why it made the choices that it did.\n6.  **Dimension Awareness**: Explicitly calculate the dimensions of the output grid based on the input grid and training examples. Ensure the code is aware of these dimensions and avoids out-of-bounds errors.\n7. **Output Simplification**: Simplify the code so that it only outputs the grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Partially failed (extracted some information but misinterpreted its relevance)\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed (incorrect grid size and content)\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect output grid)\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed (did not verify the solution against the training examples)\n*   decision\\_making: Failed (selected an incorrect solution)\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Partially failed (extracted some information but misinterpreted its relevance)\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed (applied incorrect transformations)\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect output grid)\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed (did not verify the solution against the training examples)\n*   decision\\_making: Failed (selected an incorrect solution)\n",

This suggests a severe problem with understanding the transformation rules, grid dimensions, and output formatting. The expected output is a grid derived from manipulating the input grid. This output bears no resemblance to a plausible solution.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system generates a Python function to modify a grid, showing some code generation capability. The *intention* of the generated code is relevant to the task. However, the code modifies adjacent cells of value 8, setting adjacent 0's to 3. When applied to the input, the code does apply *some* of the transformations. However, the output is not as similar as it should be to the test case. Critically, the model is including the python execution in its answer, which it shouldn't be doing.\n*   **Format Inconsistencies:** Outputs contain surrounding text like \"ANSWER\\_START\", \"ANSWER\\_END\", and code blocks (\"\\`\\`\\`json\"). The system is leaking implementation details into the output, which is incorrect and makes parsing the answer very difficult.\n*   **Code Generation Issues:** Although code generation is present, it's not consistently triggered or effective. The generated code in Sample ID 2, while relevant, doesn't lead to the correct output, pointing to flawed logic and application of transformations.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates rudimentary pattern recognition and code generation capabilities. However, its performance is severely hampered by its inability to generalize transformation rules, handle constraints related to grid dimensions, and generate outputs in the correct format. Its performance is very inconsistent. It shows glimmers of understanding in generating the transformation function in Sample ID 2, but it struggles to translate the input grid to the output grid.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Rudimentary):** Some ability to identify and leverage patterns in the training data.\n*   **Code Generation (Potential):** Capacity to generate Python code, though currently flawed in logic and application.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Generalization of Transformation Rules:** Fails to consistently apply correct transformations from training data to new inputs.\n*   **Output Generation Logic & Formatting:** Incorrect grid sizes, element placement, and extraneous formatting in the output.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Poor at adhering to constraints related to grid dimensions and element values.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Generalization of Transformation Rules**. The system needs to learn robust rules for transforming input grids into output grids based on provided examples. Without this, other improvements are unlikely to yield significant performance gains.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Refactor Output Generation and Parsing:** Remove all extraneous text (ANSWER\\_START, ANSWER\\_END, code blocks). *Strictly* output the transformed grid. This requires changes to both generation and parsing logic.\n2.  **Implement a Structured Transformation Analysis Module:** Design a module that analyzes training examples to extract transformation rules. This module should explicitly identify element mappings, spatial transformations, and grid size changes. This will require more structure than simple pattern recognition. Store the analysis in a structured data format.\n3.  **Develop a Symbolic Representation of Transformations:** Before generating executable code, create a symbolic representation of the transformation rules. This representation should be independent of the specific code implementation and can be used to verify the correctness of the transformation.  For example, identify key features of the input grid, like the location of a dominant element, and describe how that element's position relates to changes in the output grid.\n4.  **Implement Dimension Awareness in Code Generation:** Ensure that the code generation logic explicitly calculates and uses the dimensions of the output grid based on the input grid and training examples.  Add checks to prevent out-of-bounds errors.\n5. **Debugging with Intermediate Outputs:** Implement print statements throughout the code that shows the output of intermediate steps in the model. This allows us to observe the state of key variables and data structures and determine why it made the choices that it did.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited performance data, the capabilities of the AI system are currently **stable**. The system shows some potential, but its performance is inconsistent and significantly below acceptable levels. The proposed recommendations aim to drive improvement, but their effectiveness will need to be assessed in subsequent iterations.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo specific runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) were explicitly mentioned in the error messages or outputs.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition**: The system demonstrates the ability to recognize patterns in training examples and apply them to test inputs to a degree (as evidenced by the success case).\n2.  **Code Generation**: In Error Case 2, the system successfully generates a Python function to modify the grid, indicating a capacity for code generation.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Application of Transformations**: The system fails to consistently apply the correct transformations based on the training examples, resulting in incorrect output grids (Error Cases 1 & 2). The generated code in Error Case 2 seems to make the grid more different from the test grid than it should be.\n2.  **Incorrect Output Format/Size**: The generated output grids in Error Case 1 have an incorrect size, indicating an issue with the transformation and output generation logic. In the training examples, the desired output is always a significantly smaller grid than the input, which the model fails to grasp.\n3.  **Number Identification and Replacement:** The model sometimes grabs the right number to work with (4 in Error Case 1 instead of 6), but then uses it to fill an incorrectly sized grid.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Generalization of Transformation Rules**: The system struggles to generalize the transformation rules from the training examples and apply them accurately to new inputs.\n2.  **Output Generation Logic**: The output generation process is flawed, leading to incorrect grid sizes and element placement.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Grid Size**: The system produces output grids with sizes different from those in the golden answers, indicating a failure in understanding the appropriate output dimensions.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Transformation Rules**: The transformations applied to the input grid are inconsistent and do not follow the patterns established in the training examples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **inability to accurately generalize and apply transformation rules from training examples to test inputs**, leading to incorrect output grids in terms of both size and content. The system struggles to translate observed patterns into a robust algorithm for manipulating the grid. It seems like there might be a lack of connection between the input and output grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Transformation Rule Extraction**: Improve the system's ability to extract accurate transformation rules from training examples.\n2.  **Output Generation Logic**: Refine the output generation logic to ensure the correct grid size and element placement.\n3.  **Constraint Handling:** The model should be better at handling constraints related to grid dimensions and element values.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a dedicated module for analyzing training examples**: This module would specifically identify patterns and relationships between input and output grids, such as element mappings, spatial transformations, and grid size changes.\n2.  **Refine the code generation logic**: Instead of directly generating code that manipulates the grid, consider a two-step approach. First, generate a symbolic representation of the transformation rules. Second, translate this symbolic representation into executable code. This may require a new data structure.\n3.  **Add constraints to the output generation**: Implement constraints that ensure the output grid adheres to the expected dimensions and value ranges based on the training data.\n4.  **Augment the training data**: Include more diverse training examples that cover a wider range of transformation rules and grid sizes.\n5.  **Debugging with Intermediate Outputs:** Implement print statements throughout the code that shows the output of intermediate steps in the model. This allows us to observe the state of key variables and data structures and determine why it made the choices that it did.\n6.  **Dimension Awareness**: Explicitly calculate the dimensions of the output grid based on the input grid and training examples. Ensure the code is aware of these dimensions and avoids out-of-bounds errors.\n7. **Output Simplification**: Simplify the code so that it only outputs the grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Partially failed (extracted some information but misinterpreted its relevance)\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed (incorrect grid size and content)\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect output grid)\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed (did not verify the solution against the training examples)\n*   decision\\_making: Failed (selected an incorrect solution)\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Partially failed (extracted some information but misinterpreted its relevance)\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed (applied incorrect transformations)\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect output grid)\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed (did not verify the solution against the training examples)\n*   decision\\_making: Failed (selected an incorrect solution)\n",

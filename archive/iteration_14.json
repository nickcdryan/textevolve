  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using an LLM to extract meeting constraints from the input question. It then generates Python code to calculate available time slots, verifies the safety and validity of the generated code, and executes it to determine available slots. Finally, it uses the LLM to select the best time slot among the options. The functions used include `main`, `extract_meeting_info`, `generate_python_code`, `verify_python_code`, `execute_python_code`, `select_best_time`, and `call_llm`, enabling a structured and automated scheduling process.",

It's impossible to determine the exact error type without the actual 'output' field content.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1. **Problem Comprehension:** The system seems to initially understand the problem domain (scheduling meetings with constraints).\n2. **Constraint Recognition:** There's an attempt to acknowledge constraints related to participant availability and preferences.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Constraint Handling:** The system often fails to correctly apply all constraints when generating solutions, leading to incorrect time proposals or inability to find any solution.\n2. **Solution Generation & Verification:** The system either provides an invalid proposed time (Sample 2) or cannot provide a solution at all (Sample 1 & 3). The verification process is seemingly absent.\n3. **Robustness:** The system seems fragile and unable to handle problems with even a moderate degree of complexity, like a meeting involving multiple participants (Sample 3).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Flawed Constraint Satisfaction:** The system's ability to synthesize multiple constraints (participant availability, preferences, meeting duration) is unreliable. This results in solutions that violate specified conditions.\n2. **Lack of Robust Solution Verification:** The system does not appear to have a reliable mechanism to verify that the proposed solution satisfies all constraints before presenting it.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Information Request Instead of Solution:** In one instance (Sample 1), the system asks for available slots instead of providing a solution, indicating a failure to proactively process the provided schedules and constraints.\n2. **Incorrect Time Proposals:** One of the solutions (Sample 2) proposes a time that conflicts with stated preferences.\n3. **Inability to Solve Complex Cases:** The system gives up when the problem involves scheduling for multiple participants, implying that its reasoning or code execution capabilities might be limited or that it defaults to an error state when complexity increases beyond a certain threshold.\n4. **Dependence on Code Execution**: The system sometimes indicates that it cannot fulfill a request, potentially because it is unable to execute code, implying reliance on code execution when it should use built-in constraint solving.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe single most critical problem is the **inaccurate or incomplete constraint handling**, which consistently leads to either incorrect solutions or a complete failure to generate any valid solution.

This would involve more sophisticated search algorithms tailored for scheduling problems.\n3. **Solution Verification:** Implement a robust solution verification step to explicitly confirm that any proposed solution satisfies *all* constraints before it is presented as the final answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a more robust representation of time slots:** Instead of relying on free-form text, use explicit time intervals (e.g., `[(9,0), (9,30)], [(9,30), (10,0)]... `) to represent blocked times. This will make comparison and constraint checking easier.\n2. **Adopt Constraint Programming Techniques:** Explore integrating constraint programming libraries or techniques to systematically solve the scheduling problem. Libraries like `python-constraint` can define variables, domains, and constraints explicitly.\n3. **Implement a \"Check Solution\" Function:** Write a clear function that, given a proposed meeting time, rigorously checks all participants' schedules and preferences to confirm if the time is valid. This function can be reused for solution verification.\n4. **Refine Prompt Engineering with Examples Demonstrating Constraint Handling:** Provide more few-shot examples in the prompt demonstrating how to reason step-by-step about satisfying specific constraints.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your prompt.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe `SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS` reveal significant issues directly related to the `ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT`:\n\n*   **Output 1 (\"I need available slots...\")**: Confirms the \"Information Request Instead of Solution\" error pattern. The system outright *fails* to generate a proposal, instead requesting more information even though the prompt should contain all necessary details.\n*   **Output 2 & 3 (\"Here is the proposed time: Monday, 9:00-9:30\")**: Shows that the system can sometimes propose a solution, but as suggested in the error report, these solutions may not satisfy constraints. Without the original input problem, we cannot confirm if the proposed time is actually valid, but this consistency points to a flawed generation or lack of verification. Importantly, the model generates the same answer twice, indicating a lack of diversity in solution generation and/or a deterministic bug.\n\nThe \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags surrounding the output are helpful, but their value is limited if the core answer itself is incorrect.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system's current capabilities are **limited and unreliable**. While it demonstrates a basic understanding of the problem domain and some constraint recognition, its core ability to generate *valid* solutions is severely lacking. The system's accuracy (40%) reflects this unreliability. The consistent errors across multiple samples suggest a fundamental flaw in its problem-solving approach. The outputs themselves reveal a concerning lack of robustness and an inability to handle even moderately complex scheduling scenarios. The duplication of the same answer indicates determinism, a lack of problem understanding or a fault in the logic.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Problem Comprehension:** The system shows initial comprehension of the scheduling domain, which is a good foundation to build upon.\n*   **Output Structure:** While the content is flawed, the ANSWER_START/END tags provide a consistent output structure, which aids in parsing.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling & Solution Generation:** The system consistently fails to generate solutions that satisfy all constraints, making its output effectively useless.\n*   **Lack of Solution Verification:** There is no evidence of a robust verification process to ensure that proposed solutions are valid.\n*   **Inability to Solve Complex Cases:** Performance degrades significantly, or the system gives up entirely, when faced with multi-participant scenarios.\n*   **Lack of Diversity**: The solutions provided are not diverse and the prompt does not demonstrate understanding of the underlying problem.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **ACCURATE CONSTRAINT HANDLING AND SOLUTION GENERATION**. The system *must* be able to reliably generate solutions that adhere to all specified constraints.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the above analysis, here's a prioritized list of actionable recommendations for the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Time Slot Representation:** As suggested previously, move away from free-form text for time slots. Use structured data (e.g., lists of tuples) to represent available and blocked times. This will enable precise comparisons and simplify constraint checking.\n    ```python\n    # Example:\n    participant_a_schedule = [((9, 0), (9, 30)), ((10, 0), (10, 30)), ((14, 0), (15, 0))] #Tuples representing start and end times of available slots\n    ```\n\n2.  **Develop a Dedicated `is_valid_time(proposed_time, constraints)` Function:** Create a Python function that rigorously checks if a given `proposed_time` meets *all* constraints specified in the problem. This function should be the cornerstone of the solution generation and verification process.\n    ```python\n    def is_valid_time(proposed_time, constraints):\n        # Detailed logic to check all constraints (participant availability, preferences, duration)\n        # Return True if valid, False otherwise\n        pass #Replace pass with working code\n    ```\n\n3.  **Refactor Solution Generation with Constraint-Aware Logic:** Modify the solution generation process to *actively* utilize the `is_valid_time()` function. Instead of blindly generating times, the system should iterate through potential time slots, using `is_valid_time()` to filter out invalid options.\n    *  Consider a backtracking search approach to explore possible times if a feasible solution isn't immediately found.\n\n4.  **Implement Robust Solution Verification:** *Before* returning a solution, always call `is_valid_time()` to explicitly verify that the proposed time meets all constraints. If the function returns `False`, reject the solution and attempt to generate another one.\n    *   Add a maximum retry limit for solution generation to prevent infinite loops.\n\n5.  **Few-Shot Example Enhancement**: Improve the prompt's few-shot examples by:\n    * Providing multiple diverse examples of schedule and preference extraction.\n    * Demonstrating the explicit reasoning steps involved in checking constraints using the `is_valid_time` function.\n    * Including examples with multiple participants and complex preference scenarios.\n\n6.  **Input Validation**: Verify that the generated solution satisfies the input. For example, extract the participants' schedules from the initial input and then check against that.\n\n7.  **Specialized Agents**: Implement specialized agents to focus on the key aspects:\n\n   *  **Constraint Parser Agent**: Responsible for extracting all relevant constraints from the input text, including participant schedules, time preferences, and meeting duration.\n   *   **Solution Generator Agent**: Uses the parsed constraints to generate candidate meeting times. Should utilize the `is_valid_time` function and explore possible times.\n   *   **Solution Verifier Agent**: Verifies that the candidate meeting time satisfies the constraints using the `is_valid_time` function, and communicates to the Solution Generator agent that it needs to generate a new candidate time.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited information, the capability trend appears to be **stable at a low level of performance.** The system consistently exhibits the same flaws across multiple executions, indicating a lack of improvement. The error cases from the error analysis report and the sample output demonstrate that capabilities are not improving and therefore are STABLE.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a Chain-of-Thought approach by decomposing the problem into three steps: determining question type, extracting relevant information, and generating the answer. Each step uses an LLM with a specific role: question type classifier, information extractor, and answer generator. The script utilizes the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model, passing in a prompt and an optional system instruction to guide the LLM's behavior. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, and `generate_answer` sequentially, handling any errors that may arise.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Coming off their win against Denver, the Patriots flew to Seattle to play their only game on the west coast of the season. After a Patriots punt, the Seahawks drove all the way to the Patriots 9, but ended up forcing to settle for a 34-yard field goal by Steven Hauschka. The Patriots responded, racing 82 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 46-yard touchdown bomb from Brady to Welker. Seattle countered with a touchdown of their own, racing 85 yards in 7 plays, scoring on a 24-yard touchdown pass from rookie Russell Wilson to Doug Baldwin, taking a 10-7 lead. The Patriots countered again, going 80 yards in 15 plays, scoring on a yard touchdown pass to Hernandez, retaking the lead 14-10.  Seattle drove to the Patriots 48 on their next drive, but Chandler Jones strip-sacked Wilson with Ninkovich recovering at the Seahawks 47. After starting the first half with a 17-10 lead, the Patriots would only score two field goals in the second half. The Patriots drove to the Seahawks 6, but settled for a 24-yard field goal by Gostkowski, increasing their lead to 17-10. The Seahawks turned the ball over at their own 38 with less than a minute remaining in the half, and the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 3, but an intentional grounding penalty cost the Patriots points, sending the game to the half 17-10. After a Seahawks punt, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 17, and Gostkowski increased the lead to 20-10 on a 35-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After a Seattle punt, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 43, but Brady was intercepted by Richard Sherman at the Seahawks 20. After a Seahawks three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 6, but Brady was intercepted again at the 3, this time by Earl Thomas who returned it 20 yards to the Seahawks 23. On the third play of the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson hit Zach Miller for a 7-yard gain, but fumbled with Mayo recovering at the Patriots 30. The Patriots drove to the Seattle 17, settling for a 35-yard field goal by Gostkowski, extending the Patriots lead to 23-10 midway through the fourth quarter. On the first play of the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson hit Golden Tate for a 51-yard gain, with a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on Spikes, moving the ball to the Patriots 17. Four plays later, Wilson threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Braylon Edwards with 7:21 remaining, trimming the deficit to 23-17. Later in the fourth, after forcing the Patriots to go three and out, Leon Washington got the ball to the Seahawks 43 with a 25-yard return. On the fourth play of the Seahawks drive, Wilson hit Sidney Rice for a 46-yard touchdown bomb, giving the Seahawks a 24-23 lead with 1:18 remaining. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Jason Jones sacked Brady for a 7-yard loss. Two plays later on 4th down, Brady completed a pass to Welker for 15 yards, but it was 2 yards short of a first down, giving the Seahawks the ball. Wilson kneed twice and the Seahawks got the surprising win. With the loss, the Patriots fell to 3-3.  The loss also left them 0-2 against the NFC West.\n\nQUESTION: Which team won the game?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: In the game at Heinz Field, the Patriots faced off against the Pittsburgh Steelers, who started their backup QB Landry Jones as their regular starter, Ben Roethlisberger, was out with a knee injury. After a Steelers three-and-out, on the Patriots first offensive play, Brady hit Chris Hogan for a 12-yard gain, but Hogan was stripped by Jarvis Jones, who recovered the ball at the Patriots 45. The Steelers drove to the Patriots 16, but on 3rd-and-6, Landry Jones was intercepted in the end zone by Malcolm Butler on a pass intended for Antonio Brown. Taking over at their own 20, the Patriots went on an 80-yard marathon, taking 13 plays, with Brady finding James White on a 19-yard touchdown pass. After the Steelers went three-and-out again, the Patriots marched 84 more yards, scoring on Blount's 3-yard touchdown four minutes into the second quarter, increasing the Patriots lead to 14-0. The Steelers countered on their next drive. Aided by Brown's 51-yard catch, they trimmed the score to 14-7 on a 14-yard touchdown catch by Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a Patriot three-and-out, a bad punt by Ryan Allen gave the Steelers the ball at the Steelers 47. Six plays later, Jones hit Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for a holding penalty on Chris Hubbard. On the next play Jones threw an incompletion and Chris Boswell missed a 42-yard field goal. The Patriots reached midfield on their next drive, but were forced to punt. Allen pinned the Steelers at their own 6, but the Steelers challenged that the ball hit the end zone, and the ruling was reversed giving the Steelers the ball at the 20. With the better field position, the Steelers drove 66 yards to the Patriots 14, and Boswell was good from 32 yards and the score was 14-10 Patriots at halftime. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 28 and Boswell made a 46-yard field goal, trimming the score to just 14-13. The Patriots countered, through, racing 75 yards in a mere 5 plays and Brady threw a 36-yard laser to Gronkowski for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 20-13, but Gostkowski missed his second extra point of the season. Justin Gilbert returned the ensuing kickoff 32 yards to the Steelers 42. Aided by the pretty good field position, Pittsburgh responded by driving 42 yards to the Patriots 26, and Boswell kicked a 44-yard field goal trimming the score to 20-16 on the third play of the fourth quarter. The Patriots countered again, racing 75 yards and Blount scored on a 5-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 27-16. The Steelers were forced to punt on their next drive, but Edelman fumbled and the Steelers recovered at the Patriots 43. The Steelers reached the 36, but Boswell missed a 54-yard field goal, keeping the Patriots ahead 27-16. Later in the fourth quarter, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 45, but turned the ball over on downs after Jones threw an incomplete pass on 4th-and-11.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Between 1911 and 1915, Haiti was politically unstable: a series of political assassinations and forced exiles resulted in six presidents holding office during this period. Various revolutionary armies carried out the coups. Each was formed by cacos, or peasant militia from the mountains of the north, or who invaded along the porous Dominican border. They were enlisted by rival political factions under the promises of money, which would be paid after a successful revolution, and the opportunity to plunder. The United States was particularly apprehensive about the roles  played by Imperial Germany in the Western hemisphere. Controlling Tortuga, it had intervened in Haiti  and other Caribbean nations at several times during the previous few decades to exert its influence as a rival power. Germany was increasingly hostile to United States domination of the region under its claimed Monroe Doctrine. In the lead-up to the World War I, the strategic importance of the island of Hispaniola, with its manpower, material wealth, and port facilities, was understood by almost all navies operating in the Caribbean, including Germany and the still-neutral United States. Germany had invested in military and intelligence gathering across Hispaniola as part of a wider network of German interest in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 1890s through the 1910s. The United States' concern over Germany's ambitions was mirrored by apprehension and rivalry between American businessmen and the small German community in Haiti, which although numbering only about 200 in 1910 wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. German nationals controlled about 80 percent of the country's international commerce.

The American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and there was a heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America.

After a Patriots punt, the Seahawks drove all the way to the Patriots 9, but ended up forcing to settle for a 34-yard field goal by Steven Hauschka. The Patriots responded, racing 82 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 46-yard touchdown bomb from Brady to Welker. Seattle countered with a touchdown of their own, racing 85 yards in 7 plays, scoring on a 24-yard touchdown pass from rookie Russell Wilson to Doug Baldwin, taking a 10-7 lead. The Patriots countered again, going 80 yards in 15 plays, scoring on a yard touchdown pass to Hernandez, retaking the lead 14-10.  Seattle drove to the Patriots 48 on their next drive, but Chandler Jones strip-sacked Wilson with Ninkovich recovering at the Seahawks 47. After starting the first half with a 17-10 lead, the Patriots would only score two field goals in the second half. The Patriots drove to the Seahawks 6, but settled for a 24-yard field goal by Gostkowski, increasing their lead to 17-10. The Seahawks turned the ball over at their own 38 with less than a minute remaining in the half, and the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 3, but an intentional grounding penalty cost the Patriots points, sending the game to the half 17-10. After a Seahawks punt, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 17, and Gostkowski increased the lead to 20-10 on a 35-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After a Seattle punt, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 43, but Brady was intercepted by Richard Sherman at the Seahawks 20. After a Seahawks three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 6, but Brady was intercepted again at the 3, this time by Earl Thomas who returned it 20 yards to the Seahawks 23. On the third play of the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson hit Zach Miller for a 7-yard gain, but fumbled with Mayo recovering at the Patriots 30. The Patriots drove to the Seattle 17, settling for a 35-yard field goal by Gostkowski, extending the Patriots lead to 23-10 midway through the fourth quarter. On the first play of the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson hit Golden Tate for a 51-yard gain, with a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on Spikes, moving the ball to the Patriots 17. Four plays later, Wilson threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Braylon Edwards with 7:21 remaining, trimming the deficit to 23-17. Later in the fourth, after forcing the Patriots to go three and out, Leon Washington got the ball to the Seahawks 43 with a 25-yard return. On the fourth play of the Seahawks drive, Wilson hit Sidney Rice for a 46-yard touchdown bomb, giving the Seahawks a 24-23 lead with 1:18 remaining. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Jason Jones sacked Brady for a 7-yard loss. Two plays later on 4th down, Brady completed a pass to Welker for 15 yards, but it was 2 yards short of a first down, giving the Seahawks the ball. Wilson kneed twice and the Seahawks got the surprising win. With the loss, the Patriots fell to 3-3.  The loss also left them 0-2 against the NFC West.",

After a Steelers three-and-out, on the Patriots first offensive play, Brady hit Chris Hogan for a 12-yard gain, but Hogan was stripped by Jarvis Jones, who recovered the ball at the Patriots 45. The Steelers drove to the Patriots 16, but on 3rd-and-6, Landry Jones was intercepted in the end zone by Malcolm Butler on a pass intended for Antonio Brown. Taking over at their own 20, the Patriots went on an 80-yard marathon, taking 13 plays, with Brady finding James White on a 19-yard touchdown pass. After the Steelers went three-and-out again, the Patriots marched 84 more yards, scoring on Blount's 3-yard touchdown four minutes into the second quarter, increasing the Patriots lead to 14-0. The Steelers countered on their next drive. Aided by Brown's 51-yard catch, they trimmed the score to 14-7 on a 14-yard touchdown catch by Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a Patriot three-and-out, a bad punt by Ryan Allen gave the Steelers the ball at the Steelers 47. Six plays later, Jones hit Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for a holding penalty on Chris Hubbard. On the next play Jones threw an incompletion and Chris Boswell missed a 42-yard field goal. The Patriots reached midfield on their next drive, but were forced to punt. Allen pinned the Steelers at their own 6, but the Steelers challenged that the ball hit the end zone, and the ruling was reversed giving the Steelers the ball at the 20. With the better field position, the Steelers drove 66 yards to the Patriots 14, and Boswell was good from 32 yards and the score was 14-10 Patriots at halftime. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 28 and Boswell made a 46-yard field goal, trimming the score to just 14-13. The Patriots countered, through, racing 75 yards in a mere 5 plays and Brady threw a 36-yard laser to Gronkowski for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 20-13, but Gostkowski missed his second extra point of the season. Justin Gilbert returned the ensuing kickoff 32 yards to the Steelers 42. Aided by the pretty good field position, Pittsburgh responded by driving 42 yards to the Patriots 26, and Boswell kicked a 44-yard field goal trimming the score to 20-16 on the third play of the fourth quarter. The Patriots countered again, racing 75 yards and Blount scored on a 5-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 27-16. The Steelers were forced to punt on their next drive, but Edelman fumbled and the Steelers recovered at the Patriots 43. The Steelers reached the 36, but Boswell missed a 54-yard field goal, keeping the Patriots ahead 27-16. Later in the fourth quarter, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 45, but turned the ball over on downs after Jones threw an incomplete pass on 4th-and-11. Brady took a knee and the Patriots won the game. With the win the Patriots improved to 6-1 and 3-0 under Brady.",

Various revolutionary armies carried out the coups. Each was formed by cacos, or peasant militia from the mountains of the north, or who invaded along the porous Dominican border. They were enlisted by rival political factions under the promises of money, which would be paid after a successful revolution, and the opportunity to plunder. The United States was particularly apprehensive about the roles  played by Imperial Germany in the Western hemisphere. Controlling Tortuga, it had intervened in Haiti  and other Caribbean nations at several times during the previous few decades to exert its influence as a rival power. Germany was increasingly hostile to United States domination of the region under its claimed Monroe Doctrine. In the lead-up to the World War I, the strategic importance of the island of Hispaniola, with its manpower, material wealth, and port facilities, was understood by almost all navies operating in the Caribbean, including Germany and the still-neutral United States. Germany had invested in military and intelligence gathering across Hispaniola as part of a wider network of German interest in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 1890s through the 1910s. The United States' concern over Germany's ambitions was mirrored by apprehension and rivalry between American businessmen and the small German community in Haiti, which although numbering only about 200 in 1910 wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. German nationals controlled about 80 percent of the country's international commerce. They owned and operated utilities in Cap-Ha\u00eften and Port-au-Prince, including the main wharf and a tramway in the capital, and also had built the railway serving the Plain of the Cul-de-Sac.",

He compares wages and the standard of living in Pittsburgh with Birmingham, England. He finds that, after taking into account the cost of living , the standard of living of unskilled workers was about the same in the two cities, while skilled workers had about twice as high a standard of living. The American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and there was a heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America.  Shergold revealed that skilled Americans did earn higher wages than the British, yet unskilled workers did not, while Americans worked longer hours, with a greater chance of injury, and had fewer social services. Nationwide from 1890 to 1914 the unionized wages in manufacturing rose from $17.63 a week to $21.37, and the average work week fell from 54.4 to 48.8 hours a week. The pay for all factory workers was $11.94 and $15.84 because unions reached only the more skilled factory workers.",

However, the inconsistencies in formatting and the presentation of the final answer (e.g., including extra information, adding \"%\" when not strictly necessary) can be viewed as a form of implicit error, indicating inconsistencies in the system's output generation and formatting.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The system generally extracts the correct numerical values from the passages relevant to answering the question. For instance, in sample 6, the system successfully identifies \"10.7%\", \"1.7%\", and \"3.5%\" as the values needed for the calculation.\n\n2.  **Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system can perform basic arithmetic operations to derive the answer, as demonstrated in the success cases and also in the error case sample 6. It correctly attempts to subtract the relevant numbers to calculate the difference.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Over-Elaboration/Inconsistent Output:** The system often provides more information than strictly necessary for the answer, leading to mismatches with the golden answer (samples 1 and 5). The system includes extra context or explanation when a simple numerical answer is expected.\n\n2.  **Lack of Precision in Answer Matching:** The system struggles with strict answer matching when the provided answer is numerically correct but includes extra characters like \"%\" (sample 6). Although the numerical value is correct, the formatting is considered incorrect.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Rigidity in Answer Formatting/Presentation:** The system is penalized for providing correct numerical answers with extra or slightly different formatting. The system needs a more robust answer matching mechanism.\n\n2.  **Inability to Distinguish Core Answer from Supporting Information:** The system does not consistently isolate the core numerical answer when it is embedded within a larger context.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Numerical Equivalence vs. String Equivalence:** The system's answers are often numerically equivalent to the golden answers, but the string representations differ, leading to errors. This highlights a need for a more flexible evaluation metric.\n\n2.  **Over-Explanation:** The system tends to include extra information or context in its answer, which, while potentially helpful, is not always required and leads to mismatches with the golden answer.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's overly strict and inflexible answer formatting and matching process. While the system generally extracts and computes correct numerical values, it is penalized for including extra explanatory text or minor formatting variations (e.g., including the percent sign when not explicitly required).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Answer Normalization:** Implement a post-processing step that normalizes the system's answer by removing extraneous words, symbols (like \"%\"), or units, focusing on extracting the core numerical value.\n\n2.  **Flexible Matching:** Enhance the answer evaluation to consider numerical equivalence rather than strict string matching. Allow for minor variations in formatting (e.g., presence or absence of \"%\") as long as the underlying numerical value is the same.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a \"clean_answer\" function:** This function should strip non-numeric characters (except for a single decimal point), and then trim whitespace. This normalized answer can then be compared against the golden answer.\n\n2.  **Adjust Evaluation Metric:** When comparing answers, try converting both the system's answer and the golden answer to numerical values (if possible) before comparing. This will address issues with formatting variations.\n\n3.  **Refine Output Generation:** Train the system to provide only the requested numerical answer, without adding additional context or explanation unless specifically asked for. Add a flag to add additional context when needed.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 1:** solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 5:** solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 6:** solution\\_verification\n",

They are textual descriptions or extracts from the input. This contradicts the Error Analysis Report which assumes the system is extracting and manipulating numerical data. This is a *major* disconnect. The Error Analysis is analyzing an entirely different type of system than what is being presented in the sample execution outputs.\n*   **Contextual Answers:** The system provides full sentence answers rather than concise numerical answers, consistent with the \"Over-Elaboration/Inconsistent Output\" weakness identified in the Error Analysis Report (assuming the Error Analysis Report actually corresponded with this execution data).\n*   **Inconsistency in Output Format:** There isn't a clear, consistent pattern to the output. Some include extra context; others include labels like \"ranks\" that are unnecessary. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are correctly placed, but the content between them needs significant refinement.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nBased on the *execution outputs*, the system's capabilities are weak. It demonstrates rudimentary information extraction, but struggles to provide concise, relevant answers. It fails to deliver numerical outputs when the questions require numerical reasoning. The system struggles with providing concise answers and requires substantial refinement. The system appears to perform some degree of question answering (identifying entities, retrieving relevant text), but fails to produce the final answer in the correct format or content.\n\n**Assuming the Error Analysis Report is indeed about the *same system* (which is highly questionable), the following is ALSO true:**\n\nThe system's core strengths lie in information extraction and basic arithmetic reasoning. However, significant weaknesses exist in output formatting, answer precision, and the ability to distinguish core answers from supporting information. Critical bottlenecks include the system's rigidity in answer formatting and its inability to consistently isolate the core numerical answer.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** (As suggested in the Error Analysis Report) The system can generally extract relevant information from the input text. This is evidenced by the seemingly correct extraction of entities in the sample output such as \"Seahawks\" and \"Brown received one catch for 51 yards.\".\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning:** (As suggested in the Error Analysis Report) The system seems capable of performing basic arithmetic. *This is not actually shown in the execution output*.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Output Type:** The system provides textual or descriptive answers when numerical answers are expected.\n*   **Over-Elaboration/Inconsistent Output:** The system provides more information than necessary, leading to mismatches with expected answers.\n*   **Rigidity in Answer Formatting/Presentation:** (If the error analysis is accurate) The system struggles with strict answer matching when the provided answer includes extra characters or formatting.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most critical area for improvement is the *output generation*. The system *must* learn to generate concise, relevant answers in the correct format (often numerical). Addressing the disconnect between expected and actual output is paramount.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Data Reconciliation:** *The most critical step is to reconcile the execution outputs with the error analysis report. They appear to be describing entirely different systems*. Either the error analysis is based on incorrect data, or the sample execution outputs are not representative of the system being analyzed. This must be addressed before further work is done.\n2.  **Output Type Enforcement:** Implement a strict output type enforcement mechanism. If the task requires a numerical answer, the system *must* output a number. This can be achieved through training data, output constraints, and validation steps.\n3.  **Output Normalization:** Implement the `clean_answer` function suggested in the error analysis report. This function should strip non-numeric characters (except for a single decimal point), and then trim whitespace. *HOWEVER*, this only applies *IF* the system is actually meant to be generating numerical answers, which is not demonstrated by the execution outputs.\n4.  **Targeted Training Data:** Create training data examples that explicitly demonstrate the desired output format and content. For example, if the question is \"What was the final score?\", the answer should be \"27\" (or similar), *not* \"The Seahawks won with a final score of 27\".\n5.  **Context Flag:** Add a flag to allow the system to add additional context when needed, but ensure that the core answer remains concise and in the correct format.\n6.  **Error Analysis Validation:** Before future iterations, *validate* the error analysis against representative sample outputs to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nIt's impossible to accurately assess the capability trend without consistent and representative data. Based on the limited and potentially inaccurate information, it's likely that the capabilities are currently *stable but weak*. A significant overhaul is needed to steer the system in the right direction.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError in the provided data. However, the inconsistencies in formatting and the presentation of the final answer (e.g., including extra information, adding \"%\" when not strictly necessary) can be viewed as a form of implicit error, indicating inconsistencies in the system's output generation and formatting.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The system generally extracts the correct numerical values from the passages relevant to answering the question. For instance, in sample 6, the system successfully identifies \"10.7%\", \"1.7%\", and \"3.5%\" as the values needed for the calculation.\n\n2.  **Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system can perform basic arithmetic operations to derive the answer, as demonstrated in the success cases and also in the error case sample 6. It correctly attempts to subtract the relevant numbers to calculate the difference.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Over-Elaboration/Inconsistent Output:** The system often provides more information than strictly necessary for the answer, leading to mismatches with the golden answer (samples 1 and 5). The system includes extra context or explanation when a simple numerical answer is expected.\n\n2.  **Lack of Precision in Answer Matching:** The system struggles with strict answer matching when the provided answer is numerically correct but includes extra characters like \"%\" (sample 6). Although the numerical value is correct, the formatting is considered incorrect.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Rigidity in Answer Formatting/Presentation:** The system is penalized for providing correct numerical answers with extra or slightly different formatting. The system needs a more robust answer matching mechanism.\n\n2.  **Inability to Distinguish Core Answer from Supporting Information:** The system does not consistently isolate the core numerical answer when it is embedded within a larger context.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Numerical Equivalence vs. String Equivalence:** The system's answers are often numerically equivalent to the golden answers, but the string representations differ, leading to errors. This highlights a need for a more flexible evaluation metric.\n\n2.  **Over-Explanation:** The system tends to include extra information or context in its answer, which, while potentially helpful, is not always required and leads to mismatches with the golden answer.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's overly strict and inflexible answer formatting and matching process. While the system generally extracts and computes correct numerical values, it is penalized for including extra explanatory text or minor formatting variations (e.g., including the percent sign when not explicitly required).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Answer Normalization:** Implement a post-processing step that normalizes the system's answer by removing extraneous words, symbols (like \"%\"), or units, focusing on extracting the core numerical value.\n\n2.  **Flexible Matching:** Enhance the answer evaluation to consider numerical equivalence rather than strict string matching. Allow for minor variations in formatting (e.g., presence or absence of \"%\") as long as the underlying numerical value is the same.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a \"clean_answer\" function:** This function should strip non-numeric characters (except for a single decimal point), and then trim whitespace. This normalized answer can then be compared against the golden answer.\n\n2.  **Adjust Evaluation Metric:** When comparing answers, try converting both the system's answer and the golden answer to numerical values (if possible) before comparing. This will address issues with formatting variations.\n\n3.  **Refine Output Generation:** Train the system to provide only the requested numerical answer, without adding additional context or explanation unless specifically asked for. Add a flag to add additional context when needed.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 1:** solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 5:** solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 6:** solution\\_verification\n",

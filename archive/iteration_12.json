  "approach_summary": "The script solves a question by decomposing it into sub-questions, extracting relevant information, and synthesizing an answer, using the Gemini LLM for each step with a chain-of-thought approach and validation at each stage. It uses the `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, and `synthesize_answer` functions sequentially, each acting as a distinct agent role (question decomposer, information extractor, and answer synthesizer, respectively) and validating their results with an LLM before proceeding. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini model, and the main function orchestrates the overall workflow.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: The 1910 Chinese expedition to Tibet or the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1910 was a military campaign of the Qing dynasty to establish direct rule in Tibet in early 1910. The expedition occupied Lhasa on February 12 and officially deposed the 13th Dalai Lama on the 25th. Qing rule of Tibet was established in the early 18th century after the 1720 Chinese expedition to Tibet, but it was essentially a protectorate rather than a direct rule. The actual rule also waned considerably with the gradual weakening of the Qing dynasty in the 19th century. After the British expedition to Tibet in 1904 and the Sino-British treaty in 1906, the Qing decided to establish direct rule over Tibet and thus sent such an expedition in 1910. As Professor Dawa Norbu stated, \"The British military expedition and subsequent convention made the Chinese realize that their power in Tibet had disappeared. So, in 1910 China invaded Tibet, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.\" In the late winter of 1910, the Manchu government in Beijing was furious with the 13th Dalai Lama. His government, having witnessed the dissolution of its domains in Khams by Qing administrators, and fearing that the amban in Lhasa was going to eliminate its temporal authority, cut this imperial officer off from the sustenance that the Tibet government had guaranteed him in a prior agreement with the Qing court. When a relief column arrived in Lhasa from Sichuan to break the amban out of his isolation, the Dalai Lama fled for British India. However, the direct rule over Tibet proved short-lived: after the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution and the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1911-1912, Qing rule essentially ended in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet.

      "question": "PASSAGE: In September 1941, Partisans organized sabotage at the General Post Office in Zagreb.As the levels of resistance to its occupation grew, the Axis Powers responded with numerous minor offensives. There were also seven major Axis operations specifically aimed at eliminating all or most Yugoslav Partisan resistance. These major offensives were typically combined efforts by the German Wehrmacht and SS, Italy, Chetniks, the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbian collaborationist government, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The First Anti-Partisan Offensive was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the \"Republic of U\u017eice\", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards Bosnia. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility. After fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailovi\u0107, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs. This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailovi\u0107 advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the U\u017eice attack , but Britain continued to do so. On 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the 1st Proletarian Assault Brigade  - the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the \"Day of the Yugoslav People's Army\".\n\nQUESTION: How many months after Partisans organized sabotage at the General Post Office was Day of the Yugoslav People's Army?",

Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. Manu Gin\u00f3bili, who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119\u2013111.

      "original_passage": "The 1910 Chinese expedition to Tibet or the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1910 was a military campaign of the Qing dynasty to establish direct rule in Tibet in early 1910. The expedition occupied Lhasa on February 12 and officially deposed the 13th Dalai Lama on the 25th. Qing rule of Tibet was established in the early 18th century after the 1720 Chinese expedition to Tibet, but it was essentially a protectorate rather than a direct rule. The actual rule also waned considerably with the gradual weakening of the Qing dynasty in the 19th century. After the British expedition to Tibet in 1904 and the Sino-British treaty in 1906, the Qing decided to establish direct rule over Tibet and thus sent such an expedition in 1910. As Professor Dawa Norbu stated, \"The British military expedition and subsequent convention made the Chinese realize that their power in Tibet had disappeared. So, in 1910 China invaded Tibet, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.\" In the late winter of 1910, the Manchu government in Beijing was furious with the 13th Dalai Lama. His government, having witnessed the dissolution of its domains in Khams by Qing administrators, and fearing that the amban in Lhasa was going to eliminate its temporal authority, cut this imperial officer off from the sustenance that the Tibet government had guaranteed him in a prior agreement with the Qing court. When a relief column arrived in Lhasa from Sichuan to break the amban out of his isolation, the Dalai Lama fled for British India. However, the direct rule over Tibet proved short-lived: after the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution and the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1911-1912, Qing rule essentially ended in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet. All Qing forces left Tibet by the end of 1912.",

      "original_passage": "In September 1941, Partisans organized sabotage at the General Post Office in Zagreb.As the levels of resistance to its occupation grew, the Axis Powers responded with numerous minor offensives. There were also seven major Axis operations specifically aimed at eliminating all or most Yugoslav Partisan resistance. These major offensives were typically combined efforts by the German Wehrmacht and SS, Italy, Chetniks, the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbian collaborationist government, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The First Anti-Partisan Offensive was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the \"Republic of U\u017eice\", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards Bosnia. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility. After fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailovi\u0107, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs. This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailovi\u0107 advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the U\u017eice attack , but Britain continued to do so. On 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the 1st Proletarian Assault Brigade  - the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the \"Day of the Yugoslav People's Army\".",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a few key observations:\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Formatting:** The presence of \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END\" tags suggests a structured approach to answer extraction. However, the content within these tags is not consistently formatted. For instance, some outputs directly contain the answer, while others present more complex phrases.\n2.  **Direct Answer Extraction:** The system seems to be directly extracting spans of text from the input passage and presenting them as answers. This explains the \"Overly Broad Answers\" weakness, as the extracted span might contain extraneous information.\n3.  **Lack of Reasoning Steps:** The raw outputs do not provide any insight into the reasoning process used to arrive at the answers. This makes debugging and targeted improvement difficult. The missing temporal reasoning and answer precision modules are particularly relevant here.\n4.  **Numerical Answer Format:** When the answer is a number, the system correctly extracts it, as seen in Samples 0 and 2. This confirms the \"Numerical Extraction\" strength.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a basic capability for information extraction, but lacks sophisticated reasoning skills. It can identify and extract numerical values and some textual spans, but struggles with tasks requiring temporal reasoning, precise information retrieval, and contextual understanding. The system is heavily reliant on direct extraction, rather than a generate-and-verify approach.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Numerical Extraction:** Consistently and accurately extracts numerical data from the text. This is a foundational strength that should be maintained.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Temporal Reasoning:** The most critical weakness is the inability to accurately understand and reason about temporal relationships between events.\n*   **Answer Precision:** The tendency to provide overly broad answers by including irrelevant information. This reduces the overall accuracy and usability of the system.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Temporal Reasoning**. Addressing this weakness will have the most significant positive impact on the system's overall performance.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Temporal Relation Extraction System:**\n    *   **Action:** Integrate a pre-trained or fine-tuned model specifically designed for temporal relation extraction.\n    *   **Details:** Utilize a model like `allenai/temporal-roberta-base` fine-tuned on a dataset like TimeBank or MATRES. This will help identify and categorize temporal relationships (e.g., BEFORE, AFTER, DURING) between events in the passage.\n2.  **Refine Extraction Logic with Question-Answering:**\n    *   **Action:** Post-process extracted information by comparing extracted components against the initial question to filter down to the best answer.\n    *   **Details:** This could involve embedding both the question and extracted answer candidates and then selecting the candidate with the highest cosine similarity to the question embedding.\n3.  **Implement Intermediate Reasoning Logging:**\n    *   **Action:** Modify the code to include logging of intermediate reasoning steps in the `output` field.\n    *   **Details:** This will provide valuable insight into the decision-making process of the system. The `output` field should show the question being answered, the text being assessed, the extracted answer, and the final reasoning for why it provided that answer. An example might look like: `\"Reasoning: Question: 'When did X happen?' Text: 'X happened after Y.' Conclusion: Therefore, the answer is [date of event X].\"`\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance and error analysis, it is difficult to determine a clear capability trend. The accuracy of 0.60 suggests a baseline level of performance, but without iterative improvements and monitoring, it's impossible to know if the capabilities are improving, declining, or remaining stable. The key is to measure again after implementing the Actionable Recommendations above.\n",

Post-processing the extracted information by comparing the question to extracted components can help filter out the best answer.\n3.  **Add Intermediate Outputs for Debugging:** Add detailed print statements to the `output` field which will display each reasoning step. This will provide greater visibility into why errors are happening in real time.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   Failed Capabilities: Information Extraction (related to dates) and Solution Generation (inferring the correct temporal order)\n*   **Sample ID 3:**\n    *   Failed Capabilities: Information extraction (specificity) and Solution Verification (assuring precision and eliminating redundancy).\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a few key observations:\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Formatting:** The presence of \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END\" tags suggests a structured approach to answer extraction. However, the content within these tags is not consistently formatted. For instance, some outputs directly contain the answer, while others present more complex phrases.\n2.  **Direct Answer Extraction:** The system seems to be directly extracting spans of text from the input passage and presenting them as answers. This explains the \"Overly Broad Answers\" weakness, as the extracted span might contain extraneous information.\n3.  **Lack of Reasoning Steps:** The raw outputs do not provide any insight into the reasoning process used to arrive at the answers. This makes debugging and targeted improvement difficult. The missing temporal reasoning and answer precision modules are particularly relevant here.\n4.  **Numerical Answer Format:** When the answer is a number, the system correctly extracts it, as seen in Samples 0 and 2. This confirms the \"Numerical Extraction\" strength.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a basic capability for information extraction, but lacks sophisticated reasoning skills. It can identify and extract numerical values and some textual spans, but struggles with tasks requiring temporal reasoning, precise information retrieval, and contextual understanding. The system is heavily reliant on direct extraction, rather than a generate-and-verify approach.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Numerical Extraction:** Consistently and accurately extracts numerical data from the text. This is a foundational strength that should be maintained.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Temporal Reasoning:** The most critical weakness is the inability to accurately understand and reason about temporal relationships between events.\n*   **Answer Precision:** The tendency to provide overly broad answers by including irrelevant information. This reduces the overall accuracy and usability of the system.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Temporal Reasoning**. Addressing this weakness will have the most significant positive impact on the system's overall performance.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Temporal Relation Extraction System:**\n    *   **Action:** Integrate a pre-trained or fine-tuned model specifically designed for temporal relation extraction.\n    *   **Details:** Utilize a model like `allenai/temporal-roberta-base` fine-tuned on a dataset like TimeBank or MATRES. This will help identify and categorize temporal relationships (e.g., BEFORE, AFTER, DURING) between events in the passage.\n2.  **Refine Extraction Logic with Question-Answering:**\n    *   **Action:** Post-process extracted information by comparing extracted components against the initial question to filter down to the best answer.\n    *   **Details:** This could involve embedding both the question and extracted answer candidates and then selecting the candidate with the highest cosine similarity to the question embedding.\n3.  **Implement Intermediate Reasoning Logging:**\n    *   **Action:** Modify the code to include logging of intermediate reasoning steps in the `output` field.\n    *   **Details:** This will provide valuable insight into the decision-making process of the system. The `output` field should show the question being answered, the text being assessed, the extracted answer, and the final reasoning for why it provided that answer. An example might look like: `\"Reasoning: Question: 'When did X happen?' Text: 'X happened after Y.' Conclusion: Therefore, the answer is [date of event X].\"`\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance and error analysis, it is difficult to determine a clear capability trend. The accuracy of 0.60 suggests a baseline level of performance, but without iterative improvements and monitoring, it's impossible to know if the capabilities are improving, declining, or remaining stable. The key is to measure again after implementing the Actionable Recommendations above.\n"

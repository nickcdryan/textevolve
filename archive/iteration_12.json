It decomposes the problem into data extraction, initial pattern identification, pattern refinement, and transformation application. Specialized agents (`extract_data`, `identify_initial_pattern`, `refine_pattern`, and `apply_refined_transformation`) are used at each stage to leverage chain-of-thought reasoning by iteratively improving the transformation pattern. The `call_llm` function is used by all the other functions to call the Gemini model with specific instructions and prompts to perform the tasks.",

However, it only replaces a single \"0\" with an \"8\" and does not complete the transformation pattern across the entire grid.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system hallucinates the number \"5\" which does not appear to be present in either input or training data.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system introduces new values (\"7\" and \"4\") not present in the input. It correctly identifies that \"5\" becomes \"4\" at times, but only applies this transformation partially. The placement of these new numbers is also inconsistent with the input transformations.\n\nThe `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are correctly implemented and the output is valid JSON. This indicates a solid foundation for output formatting, but the content is frequently incorrect.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic ability to recognize patterns but fails to consistently and accurately apply them. It struggles with complex pattern interpretation, leading to incomplete and incorrect transformations. The hallucination of numbers is a particularly concerning issue. It has structural preservation abilities, but this is insufficient given the system's inability to reliably perform the tasks at hand.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structural Preservation:** The system generally maintains the grid dimensions and relative positions of elements.\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Basic):** Demonstrates an ability to recognize patterns to a degree in the training examples.\n*   **Valid output format:** The system provides a valid and parsable JSON output.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Application:** Consistently fails to apply learned patterns accurately, resulting in incorrect element placement and incomplete transformations.\n*   **Complex Pattern Interpretation:** Struggles with patterns involving multiple transformations or dependencies.\n*   **Hallucination:** The system hallucinates numbers that are not present in the input.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Accurate Pattern Application:** The most critical area for improvement is the ability to accurately apply learned patterns. This requires better pattern interpretation, consistent transformation logic, and preventing hallucinated numbers.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Input Verification and Filtering:** Implement a check within the system to verify that the output only contains numbers present in the training data and/or input grid. This will immediately address the hallucination issue.\n2.  **Refine Pattern Detection:** Review and revise the pattern detection algorithm to better handle spatial relationships, contextual dependencies, and combinations of transformations. Consider a combination of rules-based and machine learning approaches. Focus on identifying not *what* changed, but *where* and *why* it changed.\n3.  **Debugging and Visualization:** Implement print statements to output intermediate reasoning steps. This will allow developers to better understand how the system is interpreting patterns and applying transformations. Visualize the attention weights to gain insight into what aspects of the input grid the system is focusing on.\n4.  **Introduce Number Contextual Analysis:** Develop a module that analyzes the context surrounding numbers in the grid to identify dependencies and relationships that guide the transformation process. Focus on understanding which numbers are directly affecting others.\n5. **Review of the system.** It seems that the system picks out random numbers and applies random transformations. Make sure this is not the case.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **stable**. The system consistently performs at an accuracy of 0.33 (1/3) and exhibits similar types of errors across different inputs. There is no evidence of improvement or decline. Focused effort on addressing the key weaknesses is necessary to initiate an upward trend.\n",

However, it only replaces a single \"0\" with an \"8\" and does not complete the transformation pattern across the entire grid.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system hallucinates the number \"5\" which does not appear to be present in either input or training data.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system introduces new values (\"7\" and \"4\") not present in the input. It correctly identifies that \"5\" becomes \"4\" at times, but only applies this transformation partially. The placement of these new numbers is also inconsistent with the input transformations.\n\nThe `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are correctly implemented and the output is valid JSON. This indicates a solid foundation for output formatting, but the content is frequently incorrect.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic ability to recognize patterns but fails to consistently and accurately apply them. It struggles with complex pattern interpretation, leading to incomplete and incorrect transformations. The hallucination of numbers is a particularly concerning issue. It has structural preservation abilities, but this is insufficient given the system's inability to reliably perform the tasks at hand.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structural Preservation:** The system generally maintains the grid dimensions and relative positions of elements.\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Basic):** Demonstrates an ability to recognize patterns to a degree in the training examples.\n*   **Valid output format:** The system provides a valid and parsable JSON output.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Application:** Consistently fails to apply learned patterns accurately, resulting in incorrect element placement and incomplete transformations.\n*   **Complex Pattern Interpretation:** Struggles with patterns involving multiple transformations or dependencies.\n*   **Hallucination:** The system hallucinates numbers that are not present in the input.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Accurate Pattern Application:** The most critical area for improvement is the ability to accurately apply learned patterns. This requires better pattern interpretation, consistent transformation logic, and preventing hallucinated numbers.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Input Verification and Filtering:** Implement a check within the system to verify that the output only contains numbers present in the training data and/or input grid. This will immediately address the hallucination issue.\n2.  **Refine Pattern Detection:** Review and revise the pattern detection algorithm to better handle spatial relationships, contextual dependencies, and combinations of transformations. Consider a combination of rules-based and machine learning approaches. Focus on identifying not *what* changed, but *where* and *why* it changed.\n3.  **Debugging and Visualization:** Implement print statements to output intermediate reasoning steps. This will allow developers to better understand how the system is interpreting patterns and applying transformations. Visualize the attention weights to gain insight into what aspects of the input grid the system is focusing on.\n4.  **Introduce Number Contextual Analysis:** Develop a module that analyzes the context surrounding numbers in the grid to identify dependencies and relationships that guide the transformation process. Focus on understanding which numbers are directly affecting others.\n5. **Review of the system.** It seems that the system picks out random numbers and applies random transformations. Make sure this is not the case.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **stable**. The system consistently performs at an accuracy of 0.33 (1/3) and exhibits similar types of errors across different inputs. There is no evidence of improvement or decline. Focused effort on addressing the key weaknesses is necessary to initiate an upward trend.\n"

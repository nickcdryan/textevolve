  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with multiple LLM calls to answer a question. It decomposes the problem into three steps: analyzing the question type, generating a plan, and executing the plan. There are no explicit agent roles defined but the LLM is used as a planner and executor. Other functions used include `call_llm` to interact with the LLM, and `main` to orchestrate the process. The `main` function calls `call_llm` three times with different prompts to determine question type, generate a plan, and produce an answer and returns the final answer.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error observed across all error cases is:\n\n\"Error calling LLM: 404 models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent. Call ListModels to see the list of available models and their supported methods.\"\n\nThis indicates a failure to connect to or utilize the 'gemini-pro' Large Language Model (LLM) through the specified API version. The API endpoint may be unavailable, the model name might be incorrect, or the model may not be supported by the API. This prevents the system from generating any meaningful response.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the limited information (due to the complete failure), it's difficult to identify specific strengths. However, we can tentatively suggest the following:\n\n1.  **Clear Error Handling:** The system reports a specific error message (\"Error: Could not generate response.\") when the LLM call fails, indicating basic error handling is in place.\n2.  **Structured Input:** The input format, using clear \"Input Grid\" and \"Output Grid\" labels within examples, suggests a structured approach to representing the problem.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **LLM Dependency:** The system is entirely dependent on a specific LLM (gemini-pro) and its availability. A failure in accessing this LLM leads to a complete system failure.\n2.  **Lack of Fallback Mechanism:** There is no evident fallback mechanism to use an alternative LLM or a simpler rule-based approach in case the primary LLM fails.\n3.  **No Intermediate Result Handling:** Since the LLM call fails immediately, there are no intermediate results to analyze or debug the reasoning process.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM Connectivity:** The inability to reliably connect to and utilize the specified LLM is the single most critical bottleneck.\n2.  **Single Point of Failure:** The reliance on a single LLM without any fallback options constitutes a single point of failure.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe error pattern is consistent: The LLM cannot be reached, resulting in a \"Could not generate response\" error. This suggests an infrastructural issue rather than a problem with the reasoning logic itself.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to access the designated 'gemini-pro' LLM, leading to a complete failure to generate any output. This could stem from incorrect API configuration, an unavailable model, or network connectivity problems.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Connection Robustness:** Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for LLM calls, including checks for network connectivity and API availability.\n2.  **Fallback Mechanism:** Introduce a fallback mechanism, such as using a different LLM (if available) or a simpler, rule-based reasoning engine, in case the primary LLM is unavailable.\n3.  **API Configuration Verification:** Ensure the API key, model name ('gemini-pro'), and API version ('v1beta') are correctly configured.\n4.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring to detect LLM connection failures and trigger alerts.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Retry Logic:** Add a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for LLM calls. If a call fails, retry after a short delay, increasing the delay with each subsequent failure.\n2.  **Configure Fallback LLM:** If possible, configure a secondary LLM (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo) to be used if 'gemini-pro' is unavailable.  This would involve modifying the code to select the LLM based on availability.\n3.  **Implement a Heuristic Fallback:** For Grid Transformation tasks, consider implementing a simple, rule-based transformation engine as a last resort. This could involve identifying basic patterns (e.g., replacing a specific value in a specific location) and applying those rules if the LLM is unavailable.\n4.  **Add LLM Availability Checks:** Before attempting to call the LLM, perform a simple API call to check if the service is available.\n5.  **Implement Logging and Monitoring:** Add detailed logging to track LLM call failures, response times, and API errors. Use monitoring tools to track LLM availability and trigger alerts if issues are detected.\n6.  **Automated API Key Validation:** Ensure that the provided API key is valid and active using automated validation upon startup of your system.\n7.  **Implement Caching (with care):** Add a caching layer for previously computed results if appropriate for your use case. Be wary about cache invalidation issues.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nFor all samples (0, 1, 2):\n\n*   **information\\_extraction:** The system likely extracted the information correctly from the input grids, but we can't confirm due to the LLM failure.\n*   **constraint\\_handling:** Not applicable, as the system did not reach the stage of handling constraints.\n*   **solution\\_generation:** Failed due to LLM unavailability.\n*   **solution\\_verification:** Not applicable.\n*   **decision\\_making:** Not applicable.\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**System:** Grid Transformation AI\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**Version:** 1.0 (Initial Assessment)\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show a \"404\" error when attempting to call the 'gemini-pro' LLM. The error message explicitly states that the model is either not found for the specified API version ('v1beta') or is not supported for `generateContent`. The system retries the LLM call multiple times before ultimately returning a \"Could not generate response\" error. The repetition of the error message suggests a retry mechanism is in place, but it doesn't resolve the underlying problem.  The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags indicate a defined structure for the expected response, even when an error occurs.\n\nThe consistency of the error across all samples points to a systemic issue rather than input-specific problems.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has **no functional capability** in solving grid transformation tasks due to its complete reliance on an unavailable LLM. While the error handling and structured input suggest potential, the inability to access the LLM renders the system unusable. The identified strengths are currently hypothetical, as they cannot be validated without a functional LLM connection.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Potential for structured processing:** The structured input format using \"Input Grid\" and \"Output Grid\" labels provides a good foundation for representing the problem.\n*   **Basic error handling:**  The system reports a specific error message when the LLM fails.\n*   **Retry Logic:** Some retry logic exists, though it's not effective in this scenario.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Critical LLM Dependency:** Complete dependence on a single, potentially unavailable LLM (`gemini-pro`).\n*   **Lack of Fallback:** No alternative mechanism to provide functionality if the primary LLM fails.\n*   **API Configuration Issues:** Potential problems with API key, model name, or API version configuration.\n*   **Absence of Active Monitoring:** No monitoring or alerting in place to detect and react to LLM connection failures proactively.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **LLM Connection Robustness**. This includes addressing the root cause of the connection failure and implementing a fallback mechanism to ensure the system can function even when the primary LLM is unavailable.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Immediate Verification and Correction of API Configuration:**\n    *   **Verify API Key:** Confirm that the API key is valid, active, and has the necessary permissions to access the 'gemini-pro' model. Use automated validation at system startup.\n    *   **Verify Model Name and API Version:** Double-check that the model name ('gemini-pro') and API version ('v1beta') are correct and supported. Consult the LLM provider's documentation for confirmation. *Consider upgrading to a newer, more stable API version.*\n    *   **List Available Models:** Use the API's `ListModels` endpoint to confirm that 'gemini-pro' is indeed available for the configured API key and version.\n\n2.  **Implement a Fallback LLM:**\n    *   Modify the code to use an alternative LLM (e.g., 'gpt-3.5-turbo' from OpenAI) if 'gemini-pro' is unavailable.\n    *   Implement a mechanism to dynamically switch between LLMs based on availability.\n\n3.  **Enhance LLM Connection Handling:**\n    *   **Robust Retry Logic:** Enhance the existing retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter.\n    *   **Pre-Call Availability Check:** Before calling the LLM, perform a simple API call to check the service's availability.\n    *   **Exception Handling:** Improve exception handling around LLM calls to catch specific errors and log relevant information.\n\n4.  **Implement Monitoring and Alerting:**\n    *   Implement logging of LLM call failures, response times, and API errors.\n    *   Integrate with a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track LLM availability and trigger alerts if issues are detected.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining**. The system currently has no functional capabilities due to the LLM connectivity issue. Fixing this issue is critical to prevent further decline and begin improving performance. Once the LLM is accessible, the trend can be accurately assessed.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error observed across all error cases is:\n\n\"Error calling LLM: 404 models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent. Call ListModels to see the list of available models and their supported methods.\"\n\nThis indicates a failure to connect to or utilize the 'gemini-pro' Large Language Model (LLM) through the specified API version. The API endpoint may be unavailable, the model name might be incorrect, or the model may not be supported by the API. This prevents the system from generating any meaningful response.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the limited information (due to the complete failure), it's difficult to identify specific strengths. However, we can tentatively suggest the following:\n\n1.  **Clear Error Handling:** The system reports a specific error message (\"Error: Could not generate response.\") when the LLM call fails, indicating basic error handling is in place.\n2.  **Structured Input:** The input format, using clear \"Input Grid\" and \"Output Grid\" labels within examples, suggests a structured approach to representing the problem.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **LLM Dependency:** The system is entirely dependent on a specific LLM (gemini-pro) and its availability. A failure in accessing this LLM leads to a complete system failure.\n2.  **Lack of Fallback Mechanism:** There is no evident fallback mechanism to use an alternative LLM or a simpler rule-based approach in case the primary LLM fails.\n3.  **No Intermediate Result Handling:** Since the LLM call fails immediately, there are no intermediate results to analyze or debug the reasoning process.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM Connectivity:** The inability to reliably connect to and utilize the specified LLM is the single most critical bottleneck.\n2.  **Single Point of Failure:** The reliance on a single LLM without any fallback options constitutes a single point of failure.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe error pattern is consistent: The LLM cannot be reached, resulting in a \"Could not generate response\" error. This suggests an infrastructural issue rather than a problem with the reasoning logic itself.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to access the designated 'gemini-pro' LLM, leading to a complete failure to generate any output. This could stem from incorrect API configuration, an unavailable model, or network connectivity problems.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Connection Robustness:** Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for LLM calls, including checks for network connectivity and API availability.\n2.  **Fallback Mechanism:** Introduce a fallback mechanism, such as using a different LLM (if available) or a simpler, rule-based reasoning engine, in case the primary LLM is unavailable.\n3.  **API Configuration Verification:** Ensure the API key, model name ('gemini-pro'), and API version ('v1beta') are correctly configured.\n4.  **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring to detect LLM connection failures and trigger alerts.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Retry Logic:** Add a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for LLM calls. If a call fails, retry after a short delay, increasing the delay with each subsequent failure.\n2.  **Configure Fallback LLM:** If possible, configure a secondary LLM (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo) to be used if 'gemini-pro' is unavailable.  This would involve modifying the code to select the LLM based on availability.\n3.  **Implement a Heuristic Fallback:** For Grid Transformation tasks, consider implementing a simple, rule-based transformation engine as a last resort. This could involve identifying basic patterns (e.g., replacing a specific value in a specific location) and applying those rules if the LLM is unavailable.\n4.  **Add LLM Availability Checks:** Before attempting to call the LLM, perform a simple API call to check if the service is available.\n5.  **Implement Logging and Monitoring:** Add detailed logging to track LLM call failures, response times, and API errors. Use monitoring tools to track LLM availability and trigger alerts if issues are detected.\n6.  **Automated API Key Validation:** Ensure that the provided API key is valid and active using automated validation upon startup of your system.\n7.  **Implement Caching (with care):** Add a caching layer for previously computed results if appropriate for your use case. Be wary about cache invalidation issues.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nFor all samples (0, 1, 2):\n\n*   **information\\_extraction:** The system likely extracted the information correctly from the input grids, but we can't confirm due to the LLM failure.\n*   **constraint\\_handling:** Not applicable, as the system did not reach the stage of handling constraints.\n*   **solution\\_generation:** Failed due to LLM unavailability.\n*   **solution\\_verification:** Not applicable.\n*   **decision\\_making:** Not applicable.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**System:** Grid Transformation AI\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**Version:** 1.0 (Initial Assessment)\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show a \"404\" error when attempting to call the 'gemini-pro' LLM. The error message explicitly states that the model is either not found for the specified API version ('v1beta') or is not supported for `generateContent`. The system retries the LLM call multiple times before ultimately returning a \"Could not generate response\" error. The repetition of the error message suggests a retry mechanism is in place, but it doesn't resolve the underlying problem.  The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags indicate a defined structure for the expected response, even when an error occurs.\n\nThe consistency of the error across all samples points to a systemic issue rather than input-specific problems.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has **no functional capability** in solving grid transformation tasks due to its complete reliance on an unavailable LLM. While the error handling and structured input suggest potential, the inability to access the LLM renders the system unusable. The identified strengths are currently hypothetical, as they cannot be validated without a functional LLM connection.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Potential for structured processing:** The structured input format using \"Input Grid\" and \"Output Grid\" labels provides a good foundation for representing the problem.\n*   **Basic error handling:**  The system reports a specific error message when the LLM fails.\n*   **Retry Logic:** Some retry logic exists, though it's not effective in this scenario.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Critical LLM Dependency:** Complete dependence on a single, potentially unavailable LLM (`gemini-pro`).\n*   **Lack of Fallback:** No alternative mechanism to provide functionality if the primary LLM fails.\n*   **API Configuration Issues:** Potential problems with API key, model name, or API version configuration.\n*   **Absence of Active Monitoring:** No monitoring or alerting in place to detect and react to LLM connection failures proactively.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **LLM Connection Robustness**. This includes addressing the root cause of the connection failure and implementing a fallback mechanism to ensure the system can function even when the primary LLM is unavailable.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Immediate Verification and Correction of API Configuration:**\n    *   **Verify API Key:** Confirm that the API key is valid, active, and has the necessary permissions to access the 'gemini-pro' model. Use automated validation at system startup.\n    *   **Verify Model Name and API Version:** Double-check that the model name ('gemini-pro') and API version ('v1beta') are correct and supported. Consult the LLM provider's documentation for confirmation. *Consider upgrading to a newer, more stable API version.*\n    *   **List Available Models:** Use the API's `ListModels` endpoint to confirm that 'gemini-pro' is indeed available for the configured API key and version.\n\n2.  **Implement a Fallback LLM:**\n    *   Modify the code to use an alternative LLM (e.g., 'gpt-3.5-turbo' from OpenAI) if 'gemini-pro' is unavailable.\n    *   Implement a mechanism to dynamically switch between LLMs based on availability.\n\n3.  **Enhance LLM Connection Handling:**\n    *   **Robust Retry Logic:** Enhance the existing retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter.\n    *   **Pre-Call Availability Check:** Before calling the LLM, perform a simple API call to check the service's availability.\n    *   **Exception Handling:** Improve exception handling around LLM calls to catch specific errors and log relevant information.\n\n4.  **Implement Monitoring and Alerting:**\n    *   Implement logging of LLM call failures, response times, and API errors.\n    *   Integrate with a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track LLM availability and trigger alerts if issues are detected.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining**. The system currently has no functional capabilities due to the LLM connectivity issue. Fixing this issue is critical to prevent further decline and begin improving performance. Once the LLM is accessible, the trend can be accurately assessed.\n"

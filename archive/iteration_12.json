  "approach_summary": "This script solves grid transformation problems using a multi-agent approach with LLMs. It decomposes the problem into rule extraction, rule refinement, rule application, and verification steps. The agents (rule extractor, refiner, applier, and verifier) use chain-of-thought prompting to reason through the transformation process and determine the final transformed grid.\n\nThe functions used are:\n*   `call_llm`: Used by all functions to interface with the LLM.\n*   `rule_extraction`: Extracts the initial transformation rule from the input question.\n*   `refine_rule`: Refines the extracted rule based on the question and the initial extraction.\n*   `apply_rule`: Applies the refined rule to the input grid to generate the transformed grid.\n*   `verify_grid`: Verifies if the transformed grid adheres to the refined rule.\n*   `main`: Orchestrates the overall workflow by calling the functions in sequence.\n\nThe overall workflow involves extracting the rule, refining the rule, applying the rule, and verifying the final grid and returning the result.",

Here's a breakdown by sample:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The generated Python code contains nested `if` statements that are likely intended to represent rules based on the location of '3's in the grid. However, the conditions within these `if` statements appear arbitrary and do not reflect any logical pattern. The code modifies specific indices (e.g., `input_grid[2][c] = 8`) in a hardcoded manner, rather than generalizing a transformation. The overall output shows incorrect modification of the grid.\n*   **Sample 1:** The output is a JSON representation of a grid, but it doesn't correspond to a transformed grid. Instead, the \"transformation\" seems to have introduced arbitrary values (2 and 5) into the original grid without any discernible logic. The starting state of the grid is also unclear. This suggests a failure in both code generation and execution.\n*   **Sample 2:** The generated Python code consists of a long series of `if` statements, each modifying a specific element in the `input_grid`. The conditions and transformations within these statements appear to be hardcoded and do not reflect a generalizable pattern. Furthermore, some transformations overwrite previous ones, suggesting a lack of coherent planning in the code generation process. There is no indication of loops or functions used to simplify the code.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n*   **Hardcoded Indices:** The generated code relies heavily on hardcoded indices, making it inflexible and unable to generalize to different grid sizes or patterns.\n*   **Incorrect Logic:** The logic within the conditional statements is often flawed, leading to incorrect transformations. The conditions do not accurately reflect the intended pattern.\n*   **Lack of Abstraction:** The absence of loops, functions, or other abstractions makes the code verbose, repetitive, and difficult to maintain.\n*   **Unclear Transformation Logic:** The code doesn't clearly reflect a coherent transformation strategy derived from the training examples. The transformations seem to be applied haphazardly.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary ability to generate Python code and identify relevant numbers within the grid, but it fundamentally fails at pattern generalization and translating those patterns into correct and robust code. The current state suggests a system that struggles with abstraction and exhibits poor code generation practices. The system effectively has zero demonstrated capability at this time.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** Successfully generates compilable Python code.\n*   **Problem Decomposition (Attempted):** Attempts to decompose the problem into rules based on the input.\n*   **Information Extraction (Partial):** Identifies key numbers in the input.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** Fails to generalize patterns from examples.\n*   **Code Generation Logic:** The generated code contains numerous logic errors and lacks a coherent structure.\n*   **Abstraction:** The system does not utilize abstraction techniques (loops, functions) to generalize patterns.\n*   **Rule Implementation:** Even when a pattern is seemingly identified, the system fails to implement it correctly in code.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. Without this, the system will continue to produce hardcoded and incorrect code. The ability to generalize rules is paramount.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Pattern Extraction Module:** Develop a dedicated module that analyzes training examples and explicitly extracts the underlying patterns. This module should output a structured representation of the pattern, such as \"replace elements in rows X to Y with value Z by value A.\"\n2.  **Templated Code Generation:** Abandon free-form code generation in favor of a templated approach. Define code templates that incorporate the extracted patterns from the Pattern Extraction Module. For example, a template for replacing values in a range of rows/columns.\n3.  **Introduce Looping and Conditional Constructs:** Modify the code generation process to utilize `for` loops and more robust `if` conditions. Avoid hardcoding specific indices.\n4.  **Implement Unit Testing:** Generate unit tests based on training examples to automatically verify the correctness of the generated code. The tests should cover edge cases and boundary conditions.\n5.  **Prioritize Abstraction:** Modify the reward function (if applicable) to favor solutions that use loops, functions, or other abstractions. Penalize hardcoded solutions.\n6.  **Add Print Statements (During Development):** Inject `print` statements during the debugging stage to trace variable values and identify logic errors. Once the basic logic works, the print statements can be removed.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining.** The system's complete lack of accuracy suggests a decline in capabilities. It's essentially producing random or nonsensical code.\n",

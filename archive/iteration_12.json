It is failing to handle the varied ways the input text can be structured.\n*   **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** The system provides a generic error message without specific debugging details or fallbacks. It doesn't attempt alternative parsing methods or more robust extraction approaches.\n*   **No Use of LLM Reasoning for Extraction:** The system does not leverage the LLM for flexible, intelligent information extraction which could compensate for variations in text.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system cannot reliably extract the constraints, participant schedules, and meeting details, leading to a complete failure in the subsequent stages.\n*   **Lack of LLM-Driven Extraction:** Instead of relying on LLMs to extract information and handle variations, the system uses brittle string parsing techniques.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **\"List index out of range\" Error:** This error appears consistently across all samples, indicating a common issue with accessing elements in a list that are not available due to incorrect parsing or incomplete extraction of relevant data. This likely occurs when the system expects a certain number of participants or schedule entries and fails when that expectation is not met, suggesting rigid assumptions in the parsing logic.\n*   **Complete Failure:** The system doesn't degrade gracefully. If it can't extract the initial information, it fails entirely, rather than trying alternative approaches or providing a partial solution based on what it *can* extract.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **brittle parsing logic** used for information extraction. The system's inability to handle variations in input text format consistently leads to `IndexError` exceptions and complete failure. The absence of LLM-driven extraction techniques to handle unstructured text is a significant limitation. The system attempts to parse the entire input string and then extract the information using indexes, but the system fails if it doesn't have that specific format.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Replace the current parsing logic with a robust LLM-driven information extraction module capable of handling variations in text formatting and structure.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Ensure extracted constraints are correctly identified and represented in a usable format for the solution generation phase.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling with specific debugging information and fallback mechanisms.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace Brittle Parsing with LLM-Driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   Instead of using regex and string splitting, use LLM calls to extract information. For example:\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_details(text):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            Extract the following information from the text:\n            - Participants\n            - Meeting duration (if specified)\n            - Allowed days\n            - Time constraints (start and end times)\n            - Each participant's schedule:\n              - Participant Name\n              - Blocked Times\n            Present the information as a JSON object.\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt, text)\n            return parse_json_response(response)\n        ```\n    *   Implement a `parse_json_response` function to handle the structured output from the LLM. Use `try-except` blocks to handle potential JSON parsing errors.\n\n2.  **Implement a LLM-Driven Verification Agent:**\n    *   Create a \"Verification Agent\" that checks the consistency and completeness of the extracted information.\n    *   The agent should verify that all participants have schedules and that constraints are clearly defined. For example:\n        ```python\n        def verify_extracted_information(extracted_info, original_text):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are an information verification agent.\n            You are provided the original text and the extracted information\n            Verify the information is complete, consistent, and makes logical sense\n            Original Text: {original_text}\n            Extracted Info: {extracted_info}\n            Identify:\n            - Missing Information\n            - Conflicting Information\n            - Illogical Information\n            - If anything is missing, extract from the original text.\n            Output a JSON object with updated information and summary of changes.\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n            return parse_verification_json_response(response)\n        ```\n\n3.  **Implement a Retry Mechanism with Fallback Strategies:**\n    *   If the initial information extraction fails, implement a retry mechanism with slightly different prompts or extraction strategies.\n    *   Implement fallback strategies that allow the system to solve a simplified version of the problem if full information extraction is not possible. For example, if specific schedules cannot be extracted, try to find a solution assuming all participants are generally available.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 1:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 3:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 4:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates a very low level of capability in solving meeting scheduling problems. While it attempts the task, the reliance on brittle parsing for information extraction results in a complete failure across all tested samples. The system's inability to adapt to variations in input text format and the lack of robust error handling are major limitations. The core issue lies in information extraction, preventing progress in subsequent stages. The system understands the goal and general process, but is not actually able to perform.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Understanding of the Task:** The system recognizes the problem as a meeting scheduling task and attempts to identify the necessary information.\n*   **Error Message Provision:** The error messages, while generic, provide *some* indication of the failure point (extraction/parsing), which is helpful for debugging.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Brittle Parsing:** The system's reliance on rigid parsing techniques makes it highly susceptible to failure when encountering variations in input text formatting.\n*   **Lack of LLM-Driven Extraction:** The system fails to utilize the power of LLMs for flexible and intelligent information extraction, which could compensate for variations in text.\n*   **Poor Error Handling:** The system's error handling is inadequate, providing generic error messages without specific debugging information or fallback strategies.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Information Extraction:** The single most important capability to focus on improving is the system's ability to reliably extract information from the input text. This is the foundational capability upon which all subsequent steps depend.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:** Replace the current parsing logic with an LLM-driven information extraction module. Use a clearly defined prompt to instruct the LLM to extract key information (participants, schedules, constraints) and return it in a structured format (JSON). *Prioritize this over any other recommendation.*\n\n    ```python\n    def extract_meeting_details(text):\n        \"\"\"\n        Extracts meeting details using an LLM.\n        \"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        You are a highly skilled information extraction expert. Your task is to \n        extract the following details from the provided text related to a meeting scheduling request:\n\n        - **Participants:** A list of all participants who need to attend the meeting.\n        - **Meeting Duration (if specified):** The length of the meeting, if explicitly stated.  If not specified, return \"unspecified\".\n        - **Allowed Days:** The days of the week the meeting can be scheduled on, if specified. If not, return \"any\".\n        - **Time Constraints:** Any specific start and end times for the meeting, or time ranges. If none, return \"any\".\n        - **Participant Schedules:**  For each participant, list their blocked times (busy slots).\n\n        The output must be a JSON-formatted string, using the keys \"participants\", \"duration\", \"allowed_days\", \"time_constraints\", and \"schedules\".  The \"schedules\" value should be a dictionary where keys are participant names and values are lists of their blocked times.  Be as thorough as possible.  Pay close attention to ambiguous or implicit information and make reasonable inferences.\n\n        Example Output:\n        {{\n          \"participants\": [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"],\n          \"duration\": \"60 minutes\",\n          \"allowed_days\": \"Monday, Wednesday\",\n          \"time_constraints\": \"between 2 PM and 4 PM\",\n          \"schedules\": {{\n            \"Alice\": [\"9:00 AM - 10:00 AM\", \"1:00 PM - 2:00 PM\"],\n            \"Bob\": [\"10:00 AM - 11:00 AM\", \"3:00 PM - 4:00 PM\"]\n          }}\n        }}\n\n        Text:\n        {text}\n\n        Ensure the output is valid JSON. If a piece of information is not found, respond with 'null' for that field.  If the output is not valid JSON you will be severely penalized.\n        \"\"\"\n        response = call_llm(system=\"You are an information extraction expert.

If inconsistencies or missing data are identified, attempt to re-extract or infer the missing information.\n\n    ```python\n    def verify_extracted_information(extracted_info, original_text):\n        \"\"\"\n        Verifies the completeness and consistency of extracted information using an LLM.\n        \"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        You are a critical information verification agent.

If information is missing and can be inferred from the original text, add it.\n        2. **Consistency Check:** Identify any conflicting or illogical information within the extracted data (e.g., a participant listed without a schedule, conflicting time constraints). If there is conflicting info, use the original text to reconcile the discrepancy.\n        3. **Logical Sanity:** Verify that the constraints and schedules are presented in a logical manner.\n        4. **JSON Output:** Your ENTIRE response MUST be a JSON object containing the updated extracted information, using the same keys as the input 'extracted_info'. Include a \"verification_summary\" with your changes.\n        5. If nothing is missing or illogical, make the output equal to the input, and set verification summary to 'No Issues Found'.\n\n        Return the JSON.  If the output is not valid JSON you will be severely penalized.\n        \"\"\"\n        response = call_llm(system=\"You are a critical information verification agent.

Better than crashing.\n    ```\n\n3.  **Implement Basic Error Handling and Logging:** Wrap the information extraction and verification steps in `try-except` blocks to catch potential errors (e.g., JSON parsing errors). Log the errors to help with debugging. Don't just print to console.\n\n4.  **Remove reliance on index-based access of arrays:** Replace any code that expects a specific number of items to be in an array with code that is able to handle any number of items.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **stable (at a very low level)**. Without significant changes to the information extraction process, the system will continue to fail. The recommended improvements are expected to significantly increase the system's accuracy and robustness.\n",

It is failing to handle the varied ways the input text can be structured.\n*   **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** The system provides a generic error message without specific debugging details or fallbacks. It doesn't attempt alternative parsing methods or more robust extraction approaches.\n*   **No Use of LLM Reasoning for Extraction:** The system does not leverage the LLM for flexible, intelligent information extraction which could compensate for variations in text.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system cannot reliably extract the constraints, participant schedules, and meeting details, leading to a complete failure in the subsequent stages.\n*   **Lack of LLM-Driven Extraction:** Instead of relying on LLMs to extract information and handle variations, the system uses brittle string parsing techniques.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **\"List index out of range\" Error:** This error appears consistently across all samples, indicating a common issue with accessing elements in a list that are not available due to incorrect parsing or incomplete extraction of relevant data. This likely occurs when the system expects a certain number of participants or schedule entries and fails when that expectation is not met, suggesting rigid assumptions in the parsing logic.\n*   **Complete Failure:** The system doesn't degrade gracefully. If it can't extract the initial information, it fails entirely, rather than trying alternative approaches or providing a partial solution based on what it *can* extract.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **brittle parsing logic** used for information extraction. The system's inability to handle variations in input text format consistently leads to `IndexError` exceptions and complete failure. The absence of LLM-driven extraction techniques to handle unstructured text is a significant limitation. The system attempts to parse the entire input string and then extract the information using indexes, but the system fails if it doesn't have that specific format.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Replace the current parsing logic with a robust LLM-driven information extraction module capable of handling variations in text formatting and structure.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Ensure extracted constraints are correctly identified and represented in a usable format for the solution generation phase.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling with specific debugging information and fallback mechanisms.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace Brittle Parsing with LLM-Driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   Instead of using regex and string splitting, use LLM calls to extract information.

    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates a very low level of capability in solving meeting scheduling problems. While it attempts the task, the reliance on brittle parsing for information extraction results in a complete failure across all tested samples. The system's inability to adapt to variations in input text format and the lack of robust error handling are major limitations. The core issue lies in information extraction, preventing progress in subsequent stages. The system understands the goal and general process, but is not actually able to perform.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Understanding of the Task:** The system recognizes the problem as a meeting scheduling task and attempts to identify the necessary information.\n*   **Error Message Provision:** The error messages, while generic, provide *some* indication of the failure point (extraction/parsing), which is helpful for debugging.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Brittle Parsing:** The system's reliance on rigid parsing techniques makes it highly susceptible to failure when encountering variations in input text formatting.\n*   **Lack of LLM-Driven Extraction:** The system fails to utilize the power of LLMs for flexible and intelligent information extraction, which could compensate for variations in text.\n*   **Poor Error Handling:** The system's error handling is inadequate, providing generic error messages without specific debugging information or fallback strategies.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Information Extraction:** The single most important capability to focus on improving is the system's ability to reliably extract information from the input text. This is the foundational capability upon which all subsequent steps depend.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:** Replace the current parsing logic with an LLM-driven information extraction module. Use a clearly defined prompt to instruct the LLM to extract key information (participants, schedules, constraints) and return it in a structured format (JSON). *Prioritize this over any other recommendation.*\n\n    ```python\n    def extract_meeting_details(text):\n        \"\"\"\n        Extracts meeting details using an LLM.\n        \"\"\"\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        You are a highly skilled information extraction expert. Your task is to \n        extract the following details from the provided text related to a meeting scheduling request:\n\n        - **Participants:** A list of all participants who need to attend the meeting.\n        - **Meeting Duration (if specified):** The length of the meeting, if explicitly stated.  If not specified, return \"unspecified\".\n        - **Allowed Days:** The days of the week the meeting can be scheduled on, if specified. If not, return \"any\".\n        - **Time Constraints:** Any specific start and end times for the meeting, or time ranges. If none, return \"any\".\n        - **Participant Schedules:**  For each participant, list their blocked times (busy slots).\n\n        The output must be a JSON-formatted string, using the keys \"participants\", \"duration\", \"allowed_days\", \"time_constraints\", and \"schedules\".  The \"schedules\" value should be a dictionary where keys are participant names and values are lists of their blocked times.  Be as thorough as possible.  Pay close attention to ambiguous or implicit information and make reasonable inferences.\n\n        Example Output:\n        {{\n          \"participants\": [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"],\n          \"duration\": \"60 minutes\",\n          \"allowed_days\": \"Monday, Wednesday\",\n          \"time_constraints\": \"between 2 PM and 4 PM\",\n          \"schedules\": {{\n            \"Alice\": [\"9:00 AM - 10:00 AM\", \"1:00 PM - 2:00 PM\"],\n            \"Bob\": [\"10:00 AM - 11:00 AM\", \"3:00 PM - 4:00 PM\"]\n          }}\n        }}\n\n        Text:\n        {text}\n\n        Ensure the output is valid JSON.

It decomposes the problem into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The agent roles are question analyzer, passage extractor, answer generator, and answer verifier, each implemented within their corresponding functions. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer` in sequence, with `call_llm` used to interact with the Gemini LLM in each of these functions.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: In the 17th century there were many of these independent local bodies levying their own taxes and administering justice. This early form of local government played a role in the development of a political system in the Netherlands that was decentralised and dependent on communal cooperation. Widespread experience with decentralized government was a factor in the formation of the Dutch Republic in the 16th and 17th centuries. The mandate of Rijkswaterstaat , established in 1798 under French rule, was to centralise water control in the Netherlands. Local water boards refused to give up their autonomy however, so Rijkswaterstaat ended up working alongside the local water boards. Today Rijkswaterstaat has responsibility for major water control structures and other infrastructure like motorways. By 1850 there were about 3,500 water boards in the country. In modern times water boards merged as they dealt with joint  interests. Mergers eventually reduced the number to 25 water boards in 2011. The tasks of water boards remain basically unchanged. Having a rich history dating back to the Middle Ages, they are the oldest governing bodies and the oldest democratic institutions in the Netherlands. Dutch water boards have their own coat of arms, a colourful reminder of their importance in Dutch history. The historic buildings that used to house the water boards are another legacy.

David Akers made it 7-3 on a 33-yard field goal, though the Lions missed out on seven points that series when a touchdown reception by Calvin Johnson was reversed. In the second quarter, Akers connected on a 42-yard field goal to make the score 7-6. The Vikings responded with a 65-yard touchdown drive, capped by a 4-yard TD run from Peterson, to go up 14-6.

De la Cruz started his own religious order, the Confraternity of Saint Joseph  in Lucban, located in the present-day province of Quezon , in June 1840. However, there were two types of priests in the Philippines then: secular priests, or parish priests, which were usually Indio, and religious priests, or convent priests, which were usually Spanish. Due to the concentration of Spanish religious power and authority in the already-established religious orders  and the concept that Filipino priests should only stay in the church and not the convent and vice versa , the Spanish government banned the new order, especially due to its deviation from original Catholic rituals and teachings, such as prayers and rituals suited for Filipinos.However, thousands of people in Tayabas, Batangas, Laguna and even Manila already joined. Because of this, the Spanish government sent in troops to forcibly break up the order, forcing De la Cruz and his followers to rise in armed revolt in self-defense.

This early form of local government played a role in the development of a political system in the Netherlands that was decentralised and dependent on communal cooperation. Widespread experience with decentralized government was a factor in the formation of the Dutch Republic in the 16th and 17th centuries. The mandate of Rijkswaterstaat , established in 1798 under French rule, was to centralise water control in the Netherlands. Local water boards refused to give up their autonomy however, so Rijkswaterstaat ended up working alongside the local water boards. Today Rijkswaterstaat has responsibility for major water control structures and other infrastructure like motorways. By 1850 there were about 3,500 water boards in the country. In modern times water boards merged as they dealt with joint  interests. Mergers eventually reduced the number to 25 water boards in 2011. The tasks of water boards remain basically unchanged. Having a rich history dating back to the Middle Ages, they are the oldest governing bodies and the oldest democratic institutions in the Netherlands. Dutch water boards have their own coat of arms, a colourful reminder of their importance in Dutch history. The historic buildings that used to house the water boards are another legacy.

Due to the concentration of Spanish religious power and authority in the already-established religious orders  and the concept that Filipino priests should only stay in the church and not the convent and vice versa , the Spanish government banned the new order, especially due to its deviation from original Catholic rituals and teachings, such as prayers and rituals suited for Filipinos.However, thousands of people in Tayabas, Batangas, Laguna and even Manila already joined. Because of this, the Spanish government sent in troops to forcibly break up the order, forcing De la Cruz and his followers to rise in armed revolt in self-defense. Many bloody battles were fought with the order's last stand in Mount San Cristobal, near Mount Banahaw, in October 1841. The Spaniards eventually won, and Apolinario de la Cruz was executed on November 4, 1841 in the then-provincial capital, Tayabas.",

The Rams tied it up at the end of the first quarter with a 28-yard field goal by Josh Brown. To start the second quarter, the Lions took the lead with a 105-yard kickoff return by Stefan Logan, the longest touchdown run in the NFL this season. The Lions added to their lead a few minutes later with a 1-yard TD catch by Calvin Johnson. The Rams kicked another 28-yard field goal a few minutes later. The Lions made it 24-6 just before halftime with a 3-yard TD catch by Brandon Pettigrew. The Lions' defense shut out the Rams in the second half. The only score of the third quarter was a 26-yard TD catch by Nate Burleson. In the fourth quarter the Lions kicked 2 field goals: from 48 then from 47. The Lions capped off their victory with a 42-yard interception return TD by Alphonso Smith.  With the win, not only did the Lions improve to 1-4, but it was their largest margin of victory since 1995 and their first win since November 22, 2009.",

      "original_passage": "Painting has continued to be a prominent form of artistic expression in Danish culture, inspired by and also influencing major international trends in this area. These include impressionism and the modernist styles of expressionism, abstract painting and surrealism. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes De Tretten (1909\u20131912), Linien (1930s and 1940s), COBRA (avant-garde movement) (1948\u201351), Fluxus (1960s and 1970s), Junge Wilde (1980s) and more recently Superflex (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various art movements include Theodor Philipsen (1840\u20131920, impressionism and naturalism), Anna Klindt S\u00f8rensen (1899\u20131985, expressionism), Franciska Clausen (1899\u20131986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), Henry Heerup (1907\u20131993, naivism), Robert Jacobsen (1912\u20131993, abstract painting), Carl Henning Pedersen (1913\u20132007, abstract painting), Asger Jorn (1914\u20131973, Situationist, abstract painting), Bj\u00f8rn Wiinblad (1918\u20132006, art deco, orientalism), Per Kirkeby (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), Per Arnoldi (b. 1941, pop art), Michael Kvium (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg K\u00e6rn (b. 1969, superrealism).",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions:\n\n## AI System Capability Report\n\n**System Description:**  AI system designed to answer questions based on provided text passages, likely involving numerical calculations, information retrieval, and comparisons.\n\n**Performance Metrics:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.90 (9/10)\n*   Error Rate: 1/10\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs highlight the core issue:  while the *numerical values themselves* seem correct in some cases (further validation is needed based on the source passage), the outputs are consistently **isolated numbers with no context, units, or labels**. The \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END\" tags further emphasize the system's understanding of the beginning and end of an answer, but the *content* within those tags is often incomplete and lacks crucial elements. The fact that the system knows where the answer should start and end but is only putting raw numbers suggests a disconnect between the information extraction and the formatting/generation modules. The missing context surrounding the numbers (units, explanation, etc.) shows that the model might be having trouble with the \"generation\" part of the pipeline.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a promising ability to extract numerical data and perform basic calculations. However, its current capability is significantly hampered by its inability to present answers in a complete and usable format.  The core functionality of information retrieval and basic calculation seems to be functioning, but the \"last mile\" of answer formatting is deficient. This makes the system unreliable in a real-world scenario where users need answers presented clearly and with the correct units.  The system understands the concept of an answer (ANSWER\\_START and ANSWER\\_END), but the contents are not sufficiently detailed.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Numerical Information Extraction:** The system is good at identifying and extracting numerical values from text.\n*   **Basic Calculation:**  The system can perform basic numerical calculations accurately (based on the success cases).\n*   **Information retrieval:** The system can retrieve relevant information from the text passage (names, numbers, concepts).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Answer Formatting:**  Inconsistent and incomplete answer formatting is the most significant weakness.

This will likely involve a combination of unit detection, rule-based formatting, and possibly fine-tuning a language model for answer generation.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Unit Detection and Inclusion:**\n    *   Develop a rule-based system that identifies when a unit is required based on keywords in the question (e.g., \"distance,\" \"speed,\" \"area\").\n    *   Augment the extracted numerical value with the appropriate unit found in the source passage.  For example, if the question asks for \"distance in yards,\" and the passage contains \"100 yards,\" the answer should be \"100 yards,\" not just \"100\".\n    *   Leverage existing NLP libraries for named entity recognition to identify units of measurement.\n2.  **Develop a Formatting Module:**\n    *   Create a dedicated module responsible for formatting the extracted information into a coherent answer.\n    *   This module should handle issues like ordering information, adding units, and providing necessary context.\n    *   The formatting module should be data driven so that if the Golden Answer expects \"x [unit]\", the model can learn to repeat this behavior.\n3.  **Fine-tune Answer Generation (Optional, but Recommended):**\n    *   Fine-tune a pre-trained language model (e.g., T5, BART) on a dataset of question-answer pairs where the answers are formatted correctly, including units and context.\n    *   Use the extracted numerical value and the question text as input to the fine-tuned language model to generate a more complete and natural-sounding answer.\n4.  **Review and expand the Golden Answer dataset:**\n    *  Consider expanding the training dataset to include more varied questions and expected answer formats.\n    *  Ensure the Golden Answers are themselves highly consistent in their unit usage and answer ordering.\n5.  **Implement a strict validation suite:**\n    *  Implement a rigorous validation suite using high-quality, diverse, manually-created answer keys.\n    *  This validation suite should explicitly check for the presence and correctness of units, ordering of information, and overall answer clarity.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the system demonstrates potential for accurate numerical information extraction, but its overall capability is currently **stable but incomplete**. The core algorithms appear to be working.  However, the lack of proper answer formatting severely limits its usefulness. Implementing the actionable recommendations above should lead to a **significant improvement** in the system's overall capability.\n",

For example, if the question asks about \"yards,\" ensure the answer includes \"yards.\"\n2.  **Ordered Output Generation:** If the question demands multiple data points (like Stafford's touchdown yards), explicitly order the answer as they appear in the passage or reorder them to fit the Golden Answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 3:** Solution Generation (failed to include units and correct order).\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions:\n\n## AI System Capability Report\n\n**System Description:**  AI system designed to answer questions based on provided text passages, likely involving numerical calculations, information retrieval, and comparisons.\n\n**Performance Metrics:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.90 (9/10)\n*   Error Rate: 1/10\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs highlight the core issue:  while the *numerical values themselves* seem correct in some cases (further validation is needed based on the source passage), the outputs are consistently **isolated numbers with no context, units, or labels**. The \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END\" tags further emphasize the system's understanding of the beginning and end of an answer, but the *content* within those tags is often incomplete and lacks crucial elements. The fact that the system knows where the answer should start and end but is only putting raw numbers suggests a disconnect between the information extraction and the formatting/generation modules. The missing context surrounding the numbers (units, explanation, etc.) shows that the model might be having trouble with the \"generation\" part of the pipeline.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a promising ability to extract numerical data and perform basic calculations. However, its current capability is significantly hampered by its inability to present answers in a complete and usable format.  The core functionality of information retrieval and basic calculation seems to be functioning, but the \"last mile\" of answer formatting is deficient. This makes the system unreliable in a real-world scenario where users need answers presented clearly and with the correct units.  The system understands the concept of an answer (ANSWER\\_START and ANSWER\\_END), but the contents are not sufficiently detailed.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Numerical Information Extraction:** The system is good at identifying and extracting numerical values from text.\n*   **Basic Calculation:**  The system can perform basic numerical calculations accurately (based on the success cases).\n*   **Information retrieval:** The system can retrieve relevant information from the text passage (names, numbers, concepts).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Answer Formatting:**  Inconsistent and incomplete answer formatting is the most significant weakness. Specifically, the omission of units of measurement and failure to provide context for numerical answers.\n*   **Contextual Awareness for Formatting:** The system lacks the ability to infer necessary units or other formatting elements based on the question and passage context.\n*   **Lack of consistency in answer format:** The system struggles to match the format of the golden answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe **primary improvement focus** should be on **strengthening the answer formatting capability** to ensure that answers include necessary units of measurement and are presented in a clear, contextually appropriate manner.

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by employing a multi-agent system. The `main` function orchestrates the process by first calling the `extract_meeting_info` function to extract the meeting details using a specialized extraction agent with multi-example prompting and iterative validation; it then passes the extracted information to the `schedule_meeting` function to schedule a final proposed time that works. `extract_meeting_info` validates the results using a validation LLM that checks whether the extracted information is correct. These functions use `call_llm` to call the Gemini model with a prompt and system instruction.",

Noah, Bruce, Matthew are busy.\n- 16:30-17:00: Anna, Nathan, Benjamin are available. Noah, Bruce, Matthew are busy.\n\nNo time slot works for all participants. Let's re-examine the given schedules.

Matthew is busy until 16:30. Noah is busy 9:30-13:30. Bruce is busy 9:30-10:30, 11:00-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-17:00.\nLet's try to find a gap in Matthew's schedule first.\n\nI made a mistake. Matthew is busy until 16:30. But after 16:30, the meeting can happen. The only other person busy at 16:30 is Noah, who is busy until 17:00. So 16:30 won't work.\n\nIt seems there might be an error in the provided schedules, as no time slot works for everyone.\n\nHere is the proposed time: Monday, 9:00-9:30\n\nANSWER_END\n",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The output indicates \"Extraction validation failed\". This suggests a failure in parsing or validating the extracted information, leading to incorrect downstream processing.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   The system attempts to extract relevant information (participants, schedules, preferences) from the problem description.\n*   There is an attempt to validate the extracted information (Sample ID 2 mentions \"Extraction validation failed\").\n*   The system can propose a specific meeting time based on the extracted information.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system struggles to accurately extract and interpret constraints and preferences, as evidenced by the error in Sample ID 2 where \"Wednesday.\" was incorrectly identified as a preference. There appear to be issues parsing the provided schedules.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system frequently fails to identify a meeting time that satisfies all the given constraints, including existing schedules and stated preferences. The proposed times in the system answers often conflict with the schedules outlined in the questions.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system does not seem to have a robust solution verification mechanism. It proposes times that are clearly invalid based on the given schedules, suggesting a failure to check the solution against all constraints. The errors suggest that the information extraction part of the workflow is not as robust or error-free as it should be.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction & Validation:** The system's inability to accurately extract and validate schedules and constraints is the primary bottleneck. This leads to incorrect reasoning and ultimately invalid solutions. The prompt engineering and extraction methodologies used appear to be brittle.\n*   **Weak Constraint Application:** Even when the system extracts information correctly, it struggles to apply the constraints to generate a valid solution. This suggests a failure in the core scheduling logic.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Day/Time Selection:** The system frequently proposes a meeting time that conflicts with the given schedules, indicating a failure to properly account for the existing constraints.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Preferences:** The system sometimes misinterprets or ignores stated preferences, leading to solutions that violate the specified guidelines.\n*   **Brittle Information Extraction**: The system has trouble with the many ways the information can be expressed (e.g., \"Wednesday.\" incorrectly identified as a preference\").\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **unreliable information extraction, particularly in parsing schedules and preferences**, compounded by a lack of thorough constraint application and solution verification. If the data isn't extracted properly, then the downstream steps are built on a shaky foundation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Improve the accuracy and robustness of the information extraction process. Implement more sophisticated parsing techniques that can handle different formatting styles and complex constraints. Prioritize LLM reasoning capabilities instead of brittle parsing patterns.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Strengthen the constraint handling mechanism to ensure that all constraints are properly considered when generating potential solutions. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to explicitly document constraint evaluation.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Implement a more rigorous solution verification process to check the validity of the proposed solution against all given constraints. This could involve a dedicated verification module that independently checks the solution.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Information Extraction:**\n    *   **Refine Prompts:** Improve the prompts used for information extraction to provide clearer instructions and examples. Use few-shot examples strategically to guide the LLM in extracting relevant information from the text. Focus on schedule representation and constraint identification. Use more examples and vary the examples to cover different expression styles.\n    *   **Implement Validation:** Implement a multi-step extraction validation process using LLMs to ensure the extracted information is accurate and complete before proceeding. Use specific LLM calls to identify and resolve any extraction errors. Incorporate a dedicated validation agent that reviews the extracted information and flags any discrepancies or missing data.\n    *   **Leverage LLM-Based Parsing**: Replace brittle regex-based parsing with LLM-based parsing. Use the LLM to reason about the text, extract the relevant information, and structure it into a usable format. Make multiple LLM calls to extract different pieces of information, and then combine them.\n2.  **Strengthened Constraint Handling:**\n    *   **Explicit Constraint Representation:** Explicitly represent the constraints in a structured format (e.g., a list of rules) that can be easily processed by the scheduling logic.\n    *   **Constraint-Aware Solution Generation:** Modify the solution generation process to directly incorporate the constraints. Use an LLM to reason about the constraints and generate potential solutions that satisfy them.\n    *   **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** Implement chain-of-thought reasoning to walk through the process of verifying solution validity in the LLM before it is considered correct. Use a verification loop with `max_attempts` to correct errors.\n3.  **Rigorous Solution Verification:**\n    *   **Dedicated Verification Module:** Implement a dedicated verification module that independently checks the proposed solution against all constraints. This module could use a combination of LLM reasoning and deterministic code to ensure the solution is valid.\n    *   **Verification Feedback Loop:** If the verification module identifies any issues with the proposed solution, provide feedback to the solution generation process and iterate until a valid solution is found. Limit the number of iterations with `max_attempts` to prevent infinite loops.\n4.  **Input-Dependent Dynamic Routing**: Implement dynamic routing of the input problem based on type (simple scheduling, complex scheduling, etc.). Use more specific approaches for each problem type.\n5.  **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** For the particularly complex problems, analyze them from multiple perspectives and synthesize into a single, coherent solution.\n6.  **Best-of-N Approach:** Generate N candidate solutions and select the best one based on automated LLM-based evaluation.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 1:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 4:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 7:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_verification\n",

Use chain-of-thought to explain the reasoning behind each extraction.\n    *   **Extraction Verification Agent:** Implement a separate LLM *verification agent* that checks the extracted schedules for consistency and completeness. This agent should flag any errors or missing information. Use a verification loop with `max_attempts=3` to re-extract the information if errors are found.\n    *   **Preference Extraction:** Create an LLM agent to extract each person's explicit scheduling preferences (e.g., \"Debra prefers not to meet on Tuesday\").

The errors suggest that the information extraction part of the workflow is not as robust or error-free as it should be.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction & Validation:** The system's inability to accurately extract and validate schedules and constraints is the primary bottleneck. This leads to incorrect reasoning and ultimately invalid solutions. The prompt engineering and extraction methodologies used appear to be brittle.\n*   **Weak Constraint Application:** Even when the system extracts information correctly, it struggles to apply the constraints to generate a valid solution. This suggests a failure in the core scheduling logic.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Day/Time Selection:** The system frequently proposes a meeting time that conflicts with the given schedules, indicating a failure to properly account for the existing constraints.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Preferences:** The system sometimes misinterprets or ignores stated preferences, leading to solutions that violate the specified guidelines.\n*   **Brittle Information Extraction**: The system has trouble with the many ways the information can be expressed (e.g., \"Wednesday.\" incorrectly identified as a preference\").\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **unreliable information extraction, particularly in parsing schedules and preferences**, compounded by a lack of thorough constraint application and solution verification. If the data isn't extracted properly, then the downstream steps are built on a shaky foundation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Improve the accuracy and robustness of the information extraction process. Implement more sophisticated parsing techniques that can handle different formatting styles and complex constraints. Prioritize LLM reasoning capabilities instead of brittle parsing patterns.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Strengthen the constraint handling mechanism to ensure that all constraints are properly considered when generating potential solutions. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to explicitly document constraint evaluation.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Implement a more rigorous solution verification process to check the validity of the proposed solution against all given constraints. This could involve a dedicated verification module that independently checks the solution.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Information Extraction:**\n    *   **Refine Prompts:** Improve the prompts used for information extraction to provide clearer instructions and examples.

  "approach_summary": "The script implements a knowledge-base selection and targeted fact verification approach to answer factual questions using the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into knowledge base selection, targeted query generation, information retrieval (simulated), answer extraction, and fact verification. Several LLM agent roles are used, including a knowledge base selector, query generator, search engine, answer extractor, and fact verifier. The script uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini LLM, passing different prompts and system instructions for each step. The overall workflow involves selecting a knowledge base, generating a targeted query, simulating information retrieval from the selected knowledge base, extracting a potential answer, and verifying the answer's validity against the knowledge base before returning the result.",

However, the \"[Year] (likely 2005 or later)\" output in sample_id 2 suggests a potential issue with confidently extracting or identifying specific information, defaulting to a vague or incomplete answer.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Knowledge Base Selection:** The system correctly identifies and selects the appropriate knowledge base (e.g., Historical Events, Biographical Information) based on the question.\n2.  **Targeted Query Generation:** The system generates reasonable targeted queries designed to retrieve relevant information from the selected knowledge base. For example, \"Lal Bahadur Shastri Dam Almatti Dam completion date 2005\" for sample 1 and \"Maharaj Kishan Bhan Padma Bhushan year biographical information\" for sample 2.\n3.  **Information Retrieval (Simulated):** The system successfully simulates retrieving relevant search results. The simulated search results often contain the correct answer or hints pointing towards the correct answer.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inability to Extract Specific Answers from Retrieved Information:** While the system retrieves relevant information, it struggles to pinpoint and extract the precise answer required. It often presents potential sources or ranges rather than a definitive answer. This is seen in both error cases.\n2.  **Over-reliance on Simulated Search Results:** The system seems to be limited by the quality of the simulated search results. If the simulation doesn't provide explicit answers, it struggles to derive or infer the correct information.\n3. **Failure to Confirm Answers:** The system does not confirm answers before responding. The uncertainty expressed in the answer to question 2 (likely 2005 or later) could be resolved by checking the provided links in the simulated search results.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Precise Information Extraction from Retrieved Text:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to extract specific, definitive answers from the retrieved (simulated) search results. It can retrieve relevant context, but cannot isolate the exact information needed.\n2.  **Lack of Reasoning/Inference Capabilities:** The system lacks the ability to infer the answer when it isn't explicitly stated in the retrieved information. It needs to go beyond simple keyword matching and perform basic reasoning.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Vague/Uncertain Answers:** The system provides vague or uncertain answers (e.g., \"[Year] (likely 2005 or later)\") when it can't find an exact match, indicating a lack of confidence and an inability to make a firm decision based on available information.\n2.  **Dependency on Explicit Mentions:** The system struggles when the answer is not explicitly stated but needs to be inferred from the retrieved information.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **lack of a robust mechanism for precise information extraction from the retrieved (simulated) search results.** The system can identify relevant information sources, but it cannot consistently extract the specific answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Significantly improve the information extraction capabilities. This includes named entity recognition, relation extraction, and the ability to identify specific facts within the retrieved text.\n2.  **Reasoning/Inference:** Implement basic reasoning and inference capabilities to derive answers when they are not explicitly stated.\n3. **Answer Verification:** Implement a method for answer verification where the system validates its answer before returning it. This might include checking multiple sources or confirming the answer within the context of the retrieved information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a more sophisticated parsing mechanism:** Move beyond simple keyword matching and use techniques like dependency parsing or semantic role labeling to understand the relationships between words and entities in the retrieved text.\n2.  **Fine-tune a pre-trained question answering model:** Use a pre-trained model like BERT or RoBERTa, fine-tuned on a question-answering dataset, to extract answers from the retrieved text.\n3.  **Introduce a confidence score:** Assign a confidence score to each extracted answer based on the strength of the evidence. Only return answers with a high confidence score.\n4. **Implement a re-ranking method:** Re-rank the simulated search results based on the likelihood of them containing the specific answer. This may involve scoring each simulated result using a combination of metrics such as relevance, quality and specificity.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the specific date.\n    *   decision_making: Failed to make a decision on the best possible answer given the limited information.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the specific year.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incomplete/vague solution.\n    *   solution_verification: Did not verify the possible answer to confirm.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for the AI system, based on the provided information, focusing on actionable insights and concrete improvements:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs demonstrate a consistent pattern: the system effectively leverages its knowledge base selection and targeted query generation capabilities. However, it struggles to extract specific, definitive answers from the *simulated* retrieved information. The system identifies relevant information and presents it, but fails to pinpoint the exact answer. The \"[Year] (likely 2005 or later)\" output is particularly telling, highlighting uncertainty and a reliance on simulated results rather than definitive extraction and verification.  The sample output for Sample ID 0 highlights a fundamental failure to extract any answer. Even though the simulation provides information, the system does not attempt to derive an answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system possesses strong knowledge base selection and query generation capabilities. It can identify relevant information sources. However, its information extraction and reasoning capabilities are severely limited, hindering its ability to provide accurate and specific answers. The system's success hinges too heavily on the explicitness and quality of the simulated search results.  It acts more as a sophisticated search interface rather than an intelligent answer retrieval system. It shows zero capability to operate when the 'retrieved information' section does not contain the answer.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Knowledge Base Selection:** The system consistently chooses the appropriate knowledge base for the given query.\n*   **Targeted Query Generation:** The generated queries are relevant and designed to retrieve the information needed to answer the questions.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Extraction:**  The *primary* weakness.  The system's inability to pinpoint specific answers from relevant retrieved text is the most significant impediment to its overall performance.\n*   **Reasoning/Inference:** The lack of reasoning capabilities prevents the system from deriving answers when they are not explicitly stated.\n*   **Answer Verification:** The system has no mechanism to verify its answers before responding, leading to uncertainty and potential inaccuracies.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, directly addressing the identified weaknesses:\n\n1.  **Implement a Named Entity Recognition (NER) System:**\n    *   **Action:** Integrate a pre-trained NER model (e.g., from spaCy or Hugging Face Transformers) to identify and classify entities like dates, organizations, and people within the retrieved text.  Fine-tune the NER model on a dataset specifically relevant to the system's knowledge domains.\n    *   **Rationale:** NER will enable the system to identify key entities and their relationships within the text, facilitating more precise information extraction.\n    *   **Example:** For Sample ID 2, NER would identify \"Maharaj Kishan Bhan\" as a person and \"Padma Bhushan\" as an award.\n2.  **Implement a Relation Extraction Model:**\n    *   **Action:** Integrate a Relation Extraction model to identify relationships between entities. Focus on the relations that provide answers to common question types (e.g., \"award received in year\", \"date of completion\").\n    *   **Rationale:** Allows the system to understand the context surrounding the identified entities.\n    *   **Example:** For Sample ID 2, a Relation Extraction model would identify the relationship \"Maharaj Kishan Bhan received Padma Bhushan in [Year]\"\n3. **Develop Answer Verification Logic:**\n    *   **Action:** After extracting a potential answer, implement logic to cross-reference the answer with multiple sources within the simulated results. Calculate a confidence score based on the consistency of the answer across different sources.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will increase the reliability of the system's responses.\n    *   **Example:** For Sample ID 1, If multiple sources confirm that Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar was inducted into Shaukat Aziz's cabinet in 2004, the confidence score for that answer increases.\n4.  **Implement a more robust fallback mechanism:**\n    *   **Action:** When no definitive answer can be extracted with high confidence, rather than outputting \"Unable to answer,\" implement a mechanism to provide a summarized response that incorporates the most relevant information from the retrieved text. This could involve extracting key sentences or providing a concise overview.\n    *   **Rationale:** This provides the user with *some* value, even when a precise answer is unavailable, and prevents the system from appearing completely incapable.\n    *   **Example:** For Sample ID 0, rather than \"Unable to answer\", the system could say \"The provided information suggests Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar's election to government post-2002\".\n5. **Refactor the code:**\n    *   **Action:** Refactor code so that all 'extract answer' sections return some value.\n    *   **Rationale:** When writing tests, the results will be more predictable.\n    *   **Example:** Ensure that every extract answer method has a `return None` or `return \"\"` statement.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's capabilities are currently **stable** but **limited**. While it consistently performs well on knowledge base selection and query generation, the lack of robust information extraction prevents significant improvement. Until the information extraction bottleneck is addressed, the system's overall performance will remain constrained.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM in a chain-of-thought manner by first extracting a transformation rule from the input grid, then applying this rule to generate a transformed grid, and finally verifying if the transformation was correct. The LLM acts as a rule extractor, transformer, and verifier. The core functions are `main` which orchestrates the entire process, `solve_grid_transformation` which decomposes the problem into rule extraction, application, and verification steps, and `call_llm` which interfaces with the Gemini API. The `solve_grid_transformation` function calls `call_llm` three times to extract the rule, apply the rule, and verify the transformation.",

It appears to be implementing hard-coded transformations based on specific numbers (1, 2, 3, 8) rather than generalizing the relationships between input and output grids.\n*   **Incorrect Offset Calculation:** The code calculates offsets incorrectly in the `solve()` function when placing transformed values. The hardcoded values like `c - 4` and `c - 5` suggest a lack of generalizing the pattern across examples.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Generalization of Transformation Rules:** The inability to generalize the grid transformation patterns from the training examples to new inputs is the most significant bottleneck.\n*   **Lack of Spatial Reasoning:** The system lacks the spatial reasoning capabilities needed to correctly determine the location of transformed elements in the output grid based on their position and value in the input grid.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Hardcoded Transformations:** The generated code contains hardcoded transformations that are specific to the values (1, 2, 3, 8) seen in the training examples. This prevents the system from generalizing to new inputs that may contain different values or require different transformation patterns.\n*   **Incorrect Offsets:** The calculated offsets in the `solve()` function are often incorrect, leading to values being placed in the wrong positions in the output grid. This is likely due to a misunderstanding of the spatial relationships between elements in the input and output grids.\n*   **Inconsistent Grid Size Assumption:** The hardcoded output grid size of `([0] * 9)` suggests the system doesn't dynamically determine the output grid size from the examples but assumes a fixed size, leading to problems when the output grid size should be different.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to correctly generalize the transformation patterns from the training examples. This results in hardcoded transformations and incorrect offset calculations, leading to incorrect output grids. The reliance on specific values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 8) rather than identifying underlying spatial relationships prevents the system from solving new, unseen grid transformation tasks.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Pattern Extraction:** Improve the system's ability to extract general transformation patterns from the training examples. This may involve using more sophisticated pattern recognition techniques, such as image processing or graph analysis.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Enhance the system's spatial reasoning capabilities. This may involve using techniques such as coordinate systems, relative positioning, and symbolic reasoning to understand the spatial relationships between elements in the input and output grids.\n*   **Dynamic Grid Size Determination:** The system must dynamically determine the output grid size, not assume a fixed size.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n*   **Implement a Pattern Extraction Module:** Develop a module that analyzes the training examples and extracts general transformation rules. These rules should not be specific to the values seen in the training examples but should capture the underlying spatial relationships between elements in the input and output grids.\n*   **Use a Coordinate System:** Implement a coordinate system to represent the positions of elements in the input and output grids. This will make it easier to calculate offsets and determine the correct locations of transformed elements.\n*   **Introduce Relative Positioning:** Use relative positioning to describe the spatial relationships between elements in the input and output grids. For example, instead of saying \"the value 1 is transformed to position (x+1, y),\" say \"the value 1 is transformed to a position one unit to the right of its original position.\"\n*   **Symbolic Reasoning:** Consider using symbolic reasoning techniques to represent and manipulate transformation rules. This will allow the system to reason about the transformations in a more abstract way and generalize to new inputs more effectively.\n*   **Review Training Examples:** Carefully review the training examples to ensure that they are representative of the types of transformations that the system is expected to perform. If necessary, add more training examples to cover a wider range of transformation patterns.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:** pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, solution generation.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, solution generation.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, solution generation.\n",

The grid size is also inconsistent with the input dimensions. The appearance of \"5\" and \"7\" without a clear origin from the training data indicates the model's interpolation is flawed.\n*   **Sample 1:** The output text represents a grid filled with repeating numbers. The sequence 4, 3, 2, 6, 9 suggests some ordinality is attempted, but without relation to the input data. The grid size is inconsistent. The output is free text, not JSON, despite the prompt asking for JSON.\n*   **Sample 2:** The output consists of a Python code snippet (which is positive) followed by the execution result of that code. The code itself reveals the core issue: it hardcodes transformations based on specific numbers (1, 2, 3, 8). The output `[[0,2,1,1,0,3,0,8,8],[2,2,0,0,0,3,3,0,8],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]` is an attempt at generating the target grid but is incorrect due to these hardcoded rules and incorrect offset calculations. The intended output grid size (3x9) is inconsistent with some of the other outputs (10x10). It uses `print` instead of returning an object, which would then get serialized to JSON. This likely explains the malformed outputs of the earlier samples.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates very limited capability in solving grid transformation tasks. While it can generate Python code, the generated code fails to generalize transformation rules and relies on hardcoded logic that only works for specific, seen values. This renders the system ineffective for unseen inputs. The inconsistencies in output format show it struggles with adhering to instructions.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system's ability to generate Python code is a valuable strength that should be maintained. It provides a framework for implementing transformation logic.\n*   **Constraint Handling (Partial):** The attempt to stay within grid boundaries with `0 <= output_r < len(output_grid) and 0 <= output_c < len(output_grid[0])` is a good starting point, even though the offsets are calculated incorrectly.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Generalization of Transformation Rules:** The system's inability to generalize transformation patterns from training examples is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The system struggles with spatial reasoning and correctly placing transformed elements based on their position and value in the input grid.\n*   **Instruction Following:** The system fails to consistently adhere to instructions, as seen by the text output in Sample 1.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Generalization of Transformation Rules**. Without this, the system cannot solve new grid transformation tasks effectively.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Pattern Extraction Module:** Develop a module that analyzes training examples to identify and extract general transformation rules. Focus on spatial relationships and value transformations rather than specific values. This module should produce symbolic representations of the transformations.\n2.  **Introduce a Formal Representation for Grids:** Use a well-defined coordinate system for representing grid positions. This will facilitate accurate offset calculations and spatial reasoning. Specifically, stop hardcoding offsets and compute them symbolically.\n3.  **Refine Training Data:** Ensure that the training data includes a diverse set of transformation patterns and grid sizes. Verify the training set examples are correctly labeled with the expected output grids.\n4.  **Standardize Output Format:** Enforce a consistent output format (JSON) across all samples. Modify the generated Python code to return a grid as a Python object (list of lists), which is then serialized to JSON. Use a validation step to ensure the output conforms to this format.\n5.  **Implement Testing and Validation:** Create a testing framework to automatically evaluate the system's performance on a set of unseen grid transformation tasks. Track accuracy metrics and identify areas for improvement.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **Stable**. The system can generate code and perform basic constraint checks, but its lack of generalization prevents any significant progress. Improvements are needed to shift the trend towards improvement.\n",

This will facilitate accurate offset calculations and spatial reasoning. Specifically, stop hardcoding offsets and compute them symbolically.\n3.  **Refine Training Data:** Ensure that the training data includes a diverse set of transformation patterns and grid sizes. Verify the training set examples are correctly labeled with the expected output grids.\n4.  **Standardize Output Format:** Enforce a consistent output format (JSON) across all samples. Modify the generated Python code to return a grid as a Python object (list of lists), which is then serialized to JSON. Use a validation step to ensure the output conforms to this format.\n5.  **Implement Testing and Validation:** Create a testing framework to automatically evaluate the system's performance on a set of unseen grid transformation tasks. Track accuracy metrics and identify areas for improvement.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **Stable**. The system can generate code and perform basic constraint checks, but its lack of generalization prevents any significant progress. Improvements are needed to shift the trend towards improvement.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script implements a \"Transformation by Semantic Chunking and Focused Refinement\" approach using the Gemini LLM to transform a grid based on training examples. The problem is decomposed into extracting training examples, chunking them into semantic groups (rows, columns, etc.), and transforming the test input using a refinement agent focused on relevant chunks. Two agent roles are employed: a \"Semantic Chunker\" and a \"Refinement Agent\".\n\nThe functions used are: `main` (orchestrates the process), `preprocess_question` (extracts training examples and test input), `chunk_training_examples` (chunks the training examples using an LLM), `transform_with_refinement` (transforms the test input using an LLM based on chunked examples), and `call_llm` (interacts with the Gemini LLM). The overall workflow is: `main` calls `preprocess_question`, then `chunk_training_examples`, then `transform_with_refinement`, and finally returns the transformed grid.",

The system fails to generalize from the provided examples to the test input.\n*   **Absence of code execution or debugging:** The system generates code, but there is no mechanism to actually execute the code and verify its correctness, debug and refine the strategy.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Outputting the Input:** In Sample 0, the system simply outputs the test input. This suggests a complete failure in identifying any transformation rule or an error in the code generation process that results in simply copying the input.\n*   **Generating Incorrect Matrices:** When a matrix is output, its values are different than the gold.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **failure to correctly extract and apply the grid transformation rules** from the training examples to the test input.

This could involve techniques like image analysis, pattern matching algorithms, or feature extraction.\n*   **Transformation Logic:** Develop a more robust method for translating the extracted rules into code that can correctly transform the input grid.\n*   **Code Execution and Debugging:** Implement a code execution environment where the generated code can be executed and its output compared with the golden answer or intermediate steps, for debugging and refinement purposes.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Pattern Extraction Module:**\n    *   Analyze the training examples to identify differences between input and output grids.\n    *   Look for patterns like: value changes at specific coordinates, rotations, reflections, etc.\n    *   Represent these patterns as transformation rules.\n2.  **Introduce Execution and Feedback Loop:**\n    *   Execute the generated code on the input grid.\n    *   Compare the output with expected output (if available during training).\n    *   If the output is incorrect, attempt to debug the generated code or refine the transformation rules.\n3.  **Optimize for Speed:**\n    *   Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks.\n    *   Consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms.\n    *   Implement strategies to avoid infinite loops.\n4.  **Add Print Statements:** Explicitly add print statements into the generated code, so that you can view the trace of the execution.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Likely timed out before extracting relevant info.\n    *   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n    *   solution\\_generation: Likely timed out during generation.\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: N/A\n",

    "capability_report": {
      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided information, designed to give you actionable insights for improving your AI system.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system outputs what appears to be the input grid almost verbatim. The formatting is slightly altered (`\\n` characters) but essentially replicates the input. This indicates a complete failure to identify any transformation logic or a code generation process that defaults to copying the input when it fails to understand the transformation.\n*   **Sample 1:**  A matrix is output, but its values are incorrect. This suggests that the code generation and transformation logic is flawed, leading to an incorrect result. The system attempts to transform the grid, but it does so incorrectly.\n*   **Sample 2:** A timeout error occurred. The \"Script execution timed out (60 seconds)\" message indicates the system got stuck in an infinite loop or inefficient process. The large input grid size is likely a contributing factor, highlighting scalability issues. No usable code or output was generated.\n*   **ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END Tags:** The presence of these tags suggests a structured response format, which is good. However, the failures within these tags are the problem.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a **very low level of capability** in solving grid transformation tasks. It can *attempt* code generation and understand the prompt's general intent, but it fundamentally fails to extract and apply the correct transformation rules. The system's performance is essentially at a failing level.  Its score is at 0/3, which confirms it.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Prompt Understanding:** The system correctly interprets the task as a grid transformation problem.\n*   **Code Generation (Attempt):**  The system *attempts* to generate code, indicating a general awareness of the solution approach. This is a foundational capability to build upon.\n*   **Structured Output:** Using \"ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END\" tags is a good practice that allows structured extraction of responses.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Rule Extraction and Application:** This is the **most critical weakness**. The system is unable to identify and correctly apply the transformation rules from the training examples to the test input.\n*   **Lack of Code Execution and Debugging:** There's no mechanism to test the generated code, identify errors, and refine the approach.  This prevents iterative improvement.\n*   **Scalability:** The timeout error demonstrates a significant scalability problem, especially when dealing with larger input grids.\n*   **Incorrect Output:** When an answer is provided, it is not correct.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **rule extraction and application**.  Without this, the system cannot solve the core problem. All other improvements are secondary to this.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, prioritized for immediate impact:\n\n1.  **Implement a Simplified Rule Extraction Module:**\n    *   **Focus:** Start with identifying simple, common transformation rules first. Don't try to solve all cases at once.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   \"Add X to all values\" - Start by identifying if the numbers in the grid have been increased or decreased by a certain amount.\n        *   \"Swap rows/columns\" - Implement a basic check for reflections and swapping.\n    *   **Techniques:** Use simple difference analysis between input and output training examples to identify these changes.\n2.  **Introduce a Code Execution Environment with Print Statements:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement a sandboxed environment where the generated code can be executed.\n    *   **Essential:** Force the generated code to include `print()` statements to trace the variables and grid values during execution. This will allow you to diagnose where the transformation logic goes wrong.  Print statements are critical for debugging.\n    *   **Example:** If the transformation involves adding 1 to each element, ensure the code prints the grid values *before* and *after* the addition.\n3.  **Implement a Basic Timeout Handling:**\n    *   **Action:** Regardless of the code's logic, implement a more robust timeout mechanism that prevents the system from getting stuck in infinite loops. Instead of a timeout, return \"TIMEOUT\" or a defined error message, to better understand.\n    *   **Logging:** Log when the timeout occurred and the inputs that caused it. This will help identify patterns leading to timeouts.\n4.  **Focus on Minimal Viable Examples:**\n    *   **Action:** Temporarily reduce the complexity of the training and test grids to focus on debugging the core transformation logic. Start with very small grids (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3) and gradually increase the size as the system improves.\n    *   **Rationale:** This simplifies debugging and helps isolate the root cause of errors.\n5. **Systematic Evaluation:** Implement a more systematic way of testing the code to ensure correctness. Implement unittests to verify the logic of the system is correct.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level** (near zero). Significant improvements are required to demonstrate any positive trend. The timeout issue in Sample 2 *could* indicate a slight decline if it's a new problem, but it's hard to say without more data.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\n*   **Timeout:** Sample 2 resulted in a timeout error (Script execution timed out (60 seconds)). This suggests the system is getting stuck in a loop or is taking an excessively long time to process the input, possibly due to the large input grid size.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system attempts to generate code (indicated by the presence of \"```text\" or \"```\" blocks) for solving grid transformation tasks.\n*   **Clear Question Understanding:** The system appears to understand the prompt is asking it to transform a given grid based on patterns learned from training examples.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Logic:** Even when the system produces an output matrix, the transformation logic is flawed, resulting in an incorrect answer. The produced matrix often resembles the input, indicating an inability to derive the transformation rules.\n*   **Lack of Code Execution (or Debugging):** The generated code, even if seemingly valid, does not produce the correct result. There is no feedback loop to correct the generated code, and in the case of the time out, no response is generated at all.\n*   **Scalability issues:** Sample 2 timed out, suggesting a potential issue with handling larger grids within the time limit.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inability to extract and apply transformation rules:** The core issue lies in the system's inability to correctly identify and apply the transformation rules demonstrated in the training examples. The system fails to generalize from the provided examples to the test input.\n*   **Absence of code execution or debugging:** The system generates code, but there is no mechanism to actually execute the code and verify its correctness, debug and refine the strategy.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Outputting the Input:** In Sample 0, the system simply outputs the test input. This suggests a complete failure in identifying any transformation rule or an error in the code generation process that results in simply copying the input.\n*   **Generating Incorrect Matrices:** When a matrix is output, its values are different than the gold.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **failure to correctly extract and apply the grid transformation rules** from the training examples to the test input. This is compounded by a lack of real execution and iterative debugging.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Rule Extraction:** Improve the system's ability to identify patterns and relationships within the training grids. This could involve techniques like image analysis, pattern matching algorithms, or feature extraction.\n*   **Transformation Logic:** Develop a more robust method for translating the extracted rules into code that can correctly transform the input grid.\n*   **Code Execution and Debugging:** Implement a code execution environment where the generated code can be executed and its output compared with the golden answer or intermediate steps, for debugging and refinement purposes.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Pattern Extraction Module:**\n    *   Analyze the training examples to identify differences between input and output grids.\n    *   Look for patterns like: value changes at specific coordinates, rotations, reflections, etc.\n    *   Represent these patterns as transformation rules.\n2.  **Introduce Execution and Feedback Loop:**\n    *   Execute the generated code on the input grid.\n    *   Compare the output with expected output (if available during training).\n    *   If the output is incorrect, attempt to debug the generated code or refine the transformation rules.\n3.  **Optimize for Speed:**\n    *   Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks.\n    *   Consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms.\n    *   Implement strategies to avoid infinite loops.\n4.  **Add Print Statements:** Explicitly add print statements into the generated code, so that you can view the trace of the execution.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Likely timed out before extracting relevant info.\n    *   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n    *   solution\\_generation: Likely timed out during generation.\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: N/A\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided information, designed to give you actionable insights for improving your AI system.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system outputs what appears to be the input grid almost verbatim. The formatting is slightly altered (`\\n` characters) but essentially replicates the input. This indicates a complete failure to identify any transformation logic or a code generation process that defaults to copying the input when it fails to understand the transformation.\n*   **Sample 1:**  A matrix is output, but its values are incorrect. This suggests that the code generation and transformation logic is flawed, leading to an incorrect result. The system attempts to transform the grid, but it does so incorrectly.\n*   **Sample 2:** A timeout error occurred. The \"Script execution timed out (60 seconds)\" message indicates the system got stuck in an infinite loop or inefficient process. The large input grid size is likely a contributing factor, highlighting scalability issues. No usable code or output was generated.\n*   **ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END Tags:** The presence of these tags suggests a structured response format, which is good. However, the failures within these tags are the problem.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a **very low level of capability** in solving grid transformation tasks. It can *attempt* code generation and understand the prompt's general intent, but it fundamentally fails to extract and apply the correct transformation rules. The system's performance is essentially at a failing level.  Its score is at 0/3, which confirms it.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Prompt Understanding:** The system correctly interprets the task as a grid transformation problem.\n*   **Code Generation (Attempt):**  The system *attempts* to generate code, indicating a general awareness of the solution approach. This is a foundational capability to build upon.\n*   **Structured Output:** Using \"ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END\" tags is a good practice that allows structured extraction of responses.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Rule Extraction and Application:** This is the **most critical weakness**. The system is unable to identify and correctly apply the transformation rules from the training examples to the test input.\n*   **Lack of Code Execution and Debugging:** There's no mechanism to test the generated code, identify errors, and refine the approach.  This prevents iterative improvement.\n*   **Scalability:** The timeout error demonstrates a significant scalability problem, especially when dealing with larger input grids.\n*   **Incorrect Output:** When an answer is provided, it is not correct.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **rule extraction and application**.  Without this, the system cannot solve the core problem. All other improvements are secondary to this.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, prioritized for immediate impact:\n\n1.  **Implement a Simplified Rule Extraction Module:**\n    *   **Focus:** Start with identifying simple, common transformation rules first. Don't try to solve all cases at once.\n    *   **Examples:**\n        *   \"Add X to all values\" - Start by identifying if the numbers in the grid have been increased or decreased by a certain amount.\n        *   \"Swap rows/columns\" - Implement a basic check for reflections and swapping.\n    *   **Techniques:** Use simple difference analysis between input and output training examples to identify these changes.\n2.  **Introduce a Code Execution Environment with Print Statements:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement a sandboxed environment where the generated code can be executed.\n    *   **Essential:** Force the generated code to include `print()` statements to trace the variables and grid values during execution. This will allow you to diagnose where the transformation logic goes wrong.  Print statements are critical for debugging.\n    *   **Example:** If the transformation involves adding 1 to each element, ensure the code prints the grid values *before* and *after* the addition.\n3.  **Implement a Basic Timeout Handling:**\n    *   **Action:** Regardless of the code's logic, implement a more robust timeout mechanism that prevents the system from getting stuck in infinite loops. Instead of a timeout, return \"TIMEOUT\" or a defined error message, to better understand.\n    *   **Logging:** Log when the timeout occurred and the inputs that caused it. This will help identify patterns leading to timeouts.\n4.  **Focus on Minimal Viable Examples:**\n    *   **Action:** Temporarily reduce the complexity of the training and test grids to focus on debugging the core transformation logic. Start with very small grids (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3) and gradually increase the size as the system improves.\n    *   **Rationale:** This simplifies debugging and helps isolate the root cause of errors.\n5. **Systematic Evaluation:** Implement a more systematic way of testing the code to ensure correctness. Implement unittests to verify the logic of the system is correct.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level** (near zero). Significant improvements are required to demonstrate any positive trend. The timeout issue in Sample 2 *could* indicate a slight decline if it's a new problem, but it's hard to say without more data.\n"

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and improvement suggestions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a few key observations:\n\n*   **Clear Delimiters:** The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` delimiters are correctly used in all samples, which is good for post-processing and extraction of the answer.\n*   **Direct Answer Format:** The system provides direct answers, rather than conversational responses, which is efficient, but also means there is less chance to catch and flag errors.\n*   **Sample ID 0 Issue:** The first answer \"1996\" is incorrect. This corroborates the error analysis. The system confidently returns a wrong fact, highlighting the lack of verification.\n*   **Sample ID 1 Issue:** The second answer \"Barvikha Sanatorium near Moscow\" is correct.\n*   **Sample ID 2 Issue:** The third answer \"Makena\" is correct.\n*   **Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency on how well the LLM performs. 2/3 correct is not a good ratio.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a basic capability for extracting information and providing answers, but its reliability is questionable due to inaccuracies in fact retrieval and validation. It can correctly identify and extract information in some cases, but lacks sufficient mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of its responses.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Answer Extraction:** The ability to extract and present the answer in a consistent format using clear delimiters.\n*   **Semantic Understanding:** The system shows basic semantic understanding by recognizing near-matches even with slight variations in wording (as mentioned in strengths).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Fact Retrieval Accuracy:** The system's primary weakness is its vulnerability to retrieving and providing incorrect factual information. This undermines its overall usefulness and reliability.\n*   **Lack of Fact Verification:** The absence of a robust fact verification process is a critical flaw. The system confidently presents answers without sufficient cross-referencing or validation.\n*   **Inconsistent Performance:** The model is inconsistent. Correctly answering only 2/3 of the questions is insufficient.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Fact Retrieval Accuracy and Validation**. Improving this will directly address the core issue of providing incorrect information, which significantly impacts the system's overall utility.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere's a set of concrete actions for the next iteration, based on the provided suggestions and the execution analysis:\n\n1.  **Implement Multi-Source Retrieval (MVP):** Start with a simple implementation of multi-source retrieval for a subset of question types (e.g., those involving dates).  Log the retrieved snippets from each source, including source identifiers.  Evaluate the performance improvement and resource costs.\n2.  **Develop a Basic Fact-Checking Module (POC):** Create a proof-of-concept fact-checking module using a lightweight technique (e.g., comparing the retrieved answer against a summary of top search results for the same query from a reliable search engine, using regex for dates/numbers). Focus on speed and feasibility for this initial test.\n3.  **Implement Intermediate Output Logging:** Add comprehensive logging to capture the intermediate outputs of the system, including retrieved snippets from all sources, confidence scores (if implemented), and the fact-checking module's output. This is critical for debugging and understanding where the system is failing. The logs should have detailed timestamps so that error points can easily be identified.\n4.  **Prioritize Date Extraction:** Given the specific error in Sample ID 0, prioritize improving date extraction accuracy. Use regular expressions, named entity recognition, and consistency checks (e.g., validating date formats) to improve date parsing and retrieval.\n5.  **Implement Threshold for \"Don't Know\" Response:** If confidence levels for retrieved information are below a certain threshold, implement a mechanism for the system to respond with \"I don't know\" or \"I'm not sure.\" This is preferable to providing incorrect information.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data (one iteration), it's difficult to assess the capability trend definitively. However, a baseline is established, and future iterations should be measured against this performance (67% accuracy) using the same evaluation dataset to determine if the implemented improvements are leading to an upward trend. Regularly monitoring and tracking accuracy metrics is critical.\n",

This highlights a critical weakness in the system's ability to ground its reasoning in accurate, verifiable facts.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval Accuracy:** The system needs significant improvement in the accuracy of information retrieval.\n2.  **Fact Verification:** Implement a robust fact verification mechanism to cross-reference information from multiple sources and identify potential errors.\n3.  **Source Credibility Assessment:** The system needs to be able to assess the credibility of its information sources.\n4. **Intermediate Output Logging:** Implement the ability to log intermediate outputs (e.g. retrieved snippets, reasoning steps) to facilitate debugging.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a multi-source retrieval strategy:** When answering a question, retrieve information from multiple, diverse sources.\n2.  **Implement a fact-checking module:** Use a pre-trained fact-checking model or build a custom one to verify the retrieved information against a reliable knowledge base (e.g., Wikidata).\n3.  **Implement confidence scoring:** Assign confidence scores to each piece of retrieved information based on the source's reliability, consistency across sources, and agreement with other known facts.\n4.  **Implement better tracing/logging:** Add detailed logging of intermediate steps, retrieved information, and confidence scores. This will enable easier debugging and identification of error sources.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct year.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the extracted information leading to an incorrect answer.\n    *   decision_making: Made a decision based on inaccurate information.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and improvement suggestions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a few key observations:\n\n*   **Clear Delimiters:** The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` delimiters are correctly used in all samples, which is good for post-processing and extraction of the answer.\n*   **Direct Answer Format:** The system provides direct answers, rather than conversational responses, which is efficient, but also means there is less chance to catch and flag errors.\n*   **Sample ID 0 Issue:** The first answer \"1996\" is incorrect. This corroborates the error analysis. The system confidently returns a wrong fact, highlighting the lack of verification.\n*   **Sample ID 1 Issue:** The second answer \"Barvikha Sanatorium near Moscow\" is correct.\n*   **Sample ID 2 Issue:** The third answer \"Makena\" is correct.\n*   **Inconsistency:** There is inconsistency on how well the LLM performs. 2/3 correct is not a good ratio.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a basic capability for extracting information and providing answers, but its reliability is questionable due to inaccuracies in fact retrieval and validation. It can correctly identify and extract information in some cases, but lacks sufficient mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of its responses.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Answer Extraction:** The ability to extract and present the answer in a consistent format using clear delimiters.\n*   **Semantic Understanding:** The system shows basic semantic understanding by recognizing near-matches even with slight variations in wording (as mentioned in strengths).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Fact Retrieval Accuracy:** The system's primary weakness is its vulnerability to retrieving and providing incorrect factual information. This undermines its overall usefulness and reliability.\n*   **Lack of Fact Verification:** The absence of a robust fact verification process is a critical flaw. The system confidently presents answers without sufficient cross-referencing or validation.\n*   **Inconsistent Performance:** The model is inconsistent. Correctly answering only 2/3 of the questions is insufficient.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Fact Retrieval Accuracy and Validation**. Improving this will directly address the core issue of providing incorrect information, which significantly impacts the system's overall utility.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere's a set of concrete actions for the next iteration, based on the provided suggestions and the execution analysis:\n\n1.  **Implement Multi-Source Retrieval (MVP):** Start with a simple implementation of multi-source retrieval for a subset of question types (e.g., those involving dates).  Log the retrieved snippets from each source, including source identifiers.  Evaluate the performance improvement and resource costs.\n2.  **Develop a Basic Fact-Checking Module (POC):** Create a proof-of-concept fact-checking module using a lightweight technique (e.g., comparing the retrieved answer against a summary of top search results for the same query from a reliable search engine, using regex for dates/numbers). Focus on speed and feasibility for this initial test.\n3.  **Implement Intermediate Output Logging:** Add comprehensive logging to capture the intermediate outputs of the system, including retrieved snippets from all sources, confidence scores (if implemented), and the fact-checking module's output. This is critical for debugging and understanding where the system is failing. The logs should have detailed timestamps so that error points can easily be identified.\n4.  **Prioritize Date Extraction:** Given the specific error in Sample ID 0, prioritize improving date extraction accuracy. Use regular expressions, named entity recognition, and consistency checks (e.g., validating date formats) to improve date parsing and retrieval.\n5.  **Implement Threshold for \"Don't Know\" Response:** If confidence levels for retrieved information are below a certain threshold, implement a mechanism for the system to respond with \"I don't know\" or \"I'm not sure.\" This is preferable to providing incorrect information.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data (one iteration), it's difficult to assess the capability trend definitively. However, a baseline is established, and future iterations should be measured against this performance (67% accuracy) using the same evaluation dataset to determine if the implemented improvements are leading to an upward trend. Regularly monitoring and tracking accuracy metrics is critical.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to solve grid transformation problems by first constructing a knowledge graph representing relationships between grid elements and then applying transformation rules based on this graph. The problem is decomposed into two main steps: knowledge graph construction and transformation application. Two agent roles are implicitly defined: one for constructing the knowledge graph and another for applying transformations. The functions used are `solve_grid_transformation`, `construct_knowledge_graph`, `apply_transformation`, `call_llm`, and `main`. The overall workflow involves `main` calling `solve_grid_transformation`, which in turn calls `construct_knowledge_graph` and `apply_transformation`; both of the latter call `call_llm` to interact with the LLM.",

The pattern is also incorrectly applied.\n*   **Output 1:** The output shape is incorrect again (5x5 instead of expected). Furthermore, the pattern appears to be applied incorrectly, likely failing to learn the appropriate transformation rule.\n*   **Output 2:** This one is in JSON format and is a very large grid. It's difficult to determine at a glance if the transformation is correct, but its large size and apparent complexity likely indicate incorrect pattern learning and application.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a *very limited* capability in performing grid transformation tasks. While it understands the basic format of the input and output, it consistently fails to:\n\n*   Accurately identify the underlying transformation pattern.\n*   Apply the pattern correctly to the test input.\n*   Generalize the pattern across different grid sizes and configurations.\n*   Maintain the correct output dimensions.\n\nThe accuracy of 0.33 reflects this severe deficiency.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Understands Grid Format:** The system can generate outputs that resemble the expected grid format (though often with incorrect dimensions).\n*   **Potential for Pattern Learning:** The single success case (not provided in the sample outputs but implied by the 33% accuracy) suggests that the system *can* learn simple patterns under certain circumstances.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Poor Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** This is the most critical weakness. The system fails to identify, represent, and generalize transformation patterns effectively.\n*   **Unreliable Constraint Handling (Output Shape):** The system struggles to infer and enforce output shape constraints.\n*   **Lack of Robust Solution Verification:** The system outputs incorrect solutions without apparent checks for consistency or adherence to learned patterns.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**.  A system that can accurately identify and represent the relationships between input and output grids is the foundation for all other improvements.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Pattern Representation:** Instead of relying solely on implicit learning within the model, introduce a module that *explicitly* extracts and represents the transformation pattern. This could involve:\n    *   **Symbolic Representation:**  Represent the transformation using symbolic rules (e.g., \"If cell(i, j) is X, then cell(i+1, j) becomes Y\").\n    *   **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the input grids (e.g., neighbor values, row/column indices, grid dimensions) and use these features to define the transformation.\n\n2.  **Debugging & Logging:** Add extensive `print()` statements or use a dedicated logging library to record intermediate values and decisions within the system. This will make it *much* easier to diagnose where the pattern recognition or application is going wrong. Log input grids, extracted features, inferred patterns, the transformed grid *before* shaping, and the final output.\n\n3.  **Shape Constraint Enforcement:** Implement a specific function dedicated to ensuring the output grid has the correct dimensions. This function should:\n    *   Analyze the training data to infer the output shape.\n    *   Resize or pad the transformed grid to match the inferred shape *before* outputting the final answer.  If the intermediate transformed grid is larger than the expected shape, implement a cropping mechanism guided by the successful solution.\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement & Solution Verification:** Implement a solution verification step to assess the \"quality\" of the generated output. This could involve:\n    *   **Consistency Checks:**  Verify that the transformation is applied consistently across the entire grid.\n    *   **Heuristic Evaluation:**  Develop heuristics to assess the \"reasonableness\" of the output (e.g., based on the frequency of certain values or the overall structure of the grid).  If the solution fails verification, try a different approach or re-generate the solution.\n\n5.  **Curriculum Learning:** Start with simpler grid transformation tasks and gradually increase the complexity. This will help the system learn basic pattern recognition skills before tackling more challenging problems. For example:\n    * Start with identity transformations (output is the same as input).\n    * Move to simple color/value swaps.\n    * Then introduce shifting or rotations.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy and the observed weaknesses, the capability trend is **Stable (Poor)**.  Significant changes and improvements are needed to shift the trend upwards. Without intervention, the system will likely continue to perform poorly on these tasks.\n",

The pattern is also incorrectly applied.\n*   **Output 1:** The output shape is incorrect again (5x5 instead of expected). Furthermore, the pattern appears to be applied incorrectly, likely failing to learn the appropriate transformation rule.\n*   **Output 2:** This one is in JSON format and is a very large grid. It's difficult to determine at a glance if the transformation is correct, but its large size and apparent complexity likely indicate incorrect pattern learning and application.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a *very limited* capability in performing grid transformation tasks. While it understands the basic format of the input and output, it consistently fails to:\n\n*   Accurately identify the underlying transformation pattern.\n*   Apply the pattern correctly to the test input.\n*   Generalize the pattern across different grid sizes and configurations.\n*   Maintain the correct output dimensions.\n\nThe accuracy of 0.33 reflects this severe deficiency.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Understands Grid Format:** The system can generate outputs that resemble the expected grid format (though often with incorrect dimensions).\n*   **Potential for Pattern Learning:** The single success case (not provided in the sample outputs but implied by the 33% accuracy) suggests that the system *can* learn simple patterns under certain circumstances.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Poor Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** This is the most critical weakness. The system fails to identify, represent, and generalize transformation patterns effectively.\n*   **Unreliable Constraint Handling (Output Shape):** The system struggles to infer and enforce output shape constraints.\n*   **Lack of Robust Solution Verification:** The system outputs incorrect solutions without apparent checks for consistency or adherence to learned patterns.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**.  A system that can accurately identify and represent the relationships between input and output grids is the foundation for all other improvements.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Pattern Representation:** Instead of relying solely on implicit learning within the model, introduce a module that *explicitly* extracts and represents the transformation pattern. This could involve:\n    *   **Symbolic Representation:**  Represent the transformation using symbolic rules (e.g., \"If cell(i, j) is X, then cell(i+1, j) becomes Y\").\n    *   **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the input grids (e.g., neighbor values, row/column indices, grid dimensions) and use these features to define the transformation.\n\n2.  **Debugging & Logging:** Add extensive `print()` statements or use a dedicated logging library to record intermediate values and decisions within the system. This will make it *much* easier to diagnose where the pattern recognition or application is going wrong. Log input grids, extracted features, inferred patterns, the transformed grid *before* shaping, and the final output.\n\n3.  **Shape Constraint Enforcement:** Implement a specific function dedicated to ensuring the output grid has the correct dimensions. This function should:\n    *   Analyze the training data to infer the output shape.\n    *   Resize or pad the transformed grid to match the inferred shape *before* outputting the final answer.  If the intermediate transformed grid is larger than the expected shape, implement a cropping mechanism guided by the successful solution.\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement & Solution Verification:** Implement a solution verification step to assess the \"quality\" of the generated output. This could involve:\n    *   **Consistency Checks:**  Verify that the transformation is applied consistently across the entire grid.\n    *   **Heuristic Evaluation:**  Develop heuristics to assess the \"reasonableness\" of the output (e.g., based on the frequency of certain values or the overall structure of the grid).  If the solution fails verification, try a different approach or re-generate the solution.\n\n5.  **Curriculum Learning:** Start with simpler grid transformation tasks and gradually increase the complexity. This will help the system learn basic pattern recognition skills before tackling more challenging problems. For example:\n    * Start with identity transformations (output is the same as input).\n    * Move to simple color/value swaps.\n    * Then introduce shifting or rotations.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy and the observed weaknesses, the capability trend is **Stable (Poor)**.  Significant changes and improvements are needed to shift the trend upwards. Without intervention, the system will likely continue to perform poorly on these tasks.\n"

The `extract_meeting_info` function extracts meeting details, using multi-example prompting and an LLM-based validation step, while `schedule_meeting` proposes a meeting time based on the extracted information, also employing an LLM-based validation to ensure feasibility. The `call_llm` function serves as the interface for calling the Gemini LLM API.

This is evident in all samples.\n*   **Consistent Constraint Application:** While constraints are mentioned, the model does not reliably incorporate them in the overlapping availability calculation.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Miscalculation of Available Time Slots:** A recurring pattern is the misidentification of available time slots based on the provided schedules. This leads to errors in determining which time slots are mutually available.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem to fix is the system's unreliable **interpretation and calculation of available time slots based on participant schedules.** This foundational error cascades into incorrect solution generation. The model does not take blocked times into account, leading it to believe times are available when they are not.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **information\\_extraction:** Extracting meeting schedules accurately.\n*   **constraint\\_handling:** Properly incorporating constraints on available times into the overlapping time calculations.\n*   **solution\\_verification:** The model needs a more rigorous verification process to check its conclusions against the given information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhance Schedule Parsing and Validation:** Implement a more robust and reliable method for parsing the schedule information.\n    *   Create unit tests specifically targeting schedule parsing accuracy.\n    *   Add a validation step after parsing to confirm the parsed schedule aligns with the intended representation.\n    *   Consider using a deterministic library like `datetime` to convert times to minutes in the day to facilitate accurate overlap calculations.\n2.  **Refine Overlap Calculation Logic:** Improve the logic for calculating the overlapping available time slots.\n    *   Use a more systematic approach, perhaps with a table-based representation of availability, to avoid overlooking potential conflicts.\n    *   Implement a unit test that compares overlapping availabilities that the model extracts against known examples.\n3.  **Improve Constraint Handling:** Ensure that constraints are rigorously applied throughout the process.\n    *   Formalize the constraint-handling process. Perhaps by labeling each step where constraints are enforced.\n    *   Add unit tests for the constraint handling process to make sure that constraints are not violated by proposed solutions.\n4.  **Implement Explicit Verification Step:** Include a dedicated verification step at the end to double-check the proposed solution against the provided schedules and constraints.

For instance, claiming 10:30-11:00 is available for some but not Noah and Matthew is incorrect given the initial availability lists.  The final proposed time is generally correct, but the path to getting there is flawed.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system appears to correctly identify that Timothy and Jeffrey do not have a full hour of overlap on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, and does manage to recommend a meeting slot that works for the two of them (Thursday, 13:00-14:00).\n*   **Sample 3:** The model makes a mistake in determining the overlaps for Monday (Debra being available from 9:00-9:30).

It demonstrates constraint awareness and preference handling, but these are overshadowed by the inaccurate schedule analysis. The system requires significant improvement.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Schedule Reasoning:** The system can parse schedule information and at least attempt to identify potential meeting times.\n*   **Constraint Acknowledgment:** The system is capable of acknowledging constraints in the prompt.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Schedule Interpretation:** This is the *primary* weakness. The system consistently misinterprets or miscalculates available time slots.\n*   **Faulty Overlap Calculation:** The system's method for calculating overlapping availabilities is error-prone and unreliable.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate schedule interpretation and calculation**.  This is the foundational capability upon which all other scheduling logic depends.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Time Slot Conversion and Comparison Utility:**\n    *   **Problem:** The LLM appears to be struggling with time calculations and comparisons.\n    *   **Solution:** Implement a Python utility function that converts times to minutes from midnight (e.g., \"9:00\" becomes 540). This allows for easy comparison and calculation of time slot durations and overlaps. The LLM can then call this function instead of doing the calculations itself.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        def time_to_minutes(time_str):\n            hours, minutes = map(int, time_str.split(':'))\n            return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n        def find_overlap(schedule1, schedule2):\n            # Convert schedules to minutes\n            schedule1_minutes = [(time_to_minutes(start), time_to_minutes(end)) for start, end in schedule1]\n            schedule2_minutes = [(time_to_minutes(start), time_to_minutes(end)) for start, end in schedule2]\n\n            # Logic for finding overlaps in minutes\n            # ...\n            return overlaps\n        ```\n    *   **Integration:** Instruct the LLM to extract the schedule information and pass it to this utility function, then use the *results* of the function in its reasoning process.\n2.  **Introduce a Dedicated Schedule Parsing and Validation Agent:**\n    *   **Problem:** The LLM's schedule parsing is unreliable.\n    *   **Solution:** Create a specialized agent *solely* responsible for parsing the schedule information and validating its correctness. This agent should:\n        *   Receive the raw schedule text.\n        *   Parse the schedule into a structured format (e.g., a list of time intervals).\n        *   Perform sanity checks (e.g., ensure start times are before end times, no overlapping intervals for the same person).\n        *   Return a *validated* schedule to the main agent.\n    *   **Prompting:** Use few-shot examples to teach the agent the correct parsing format and validation rules.  Focus on different schedule formats (e.g., \"9am-10am\", \"9:00 - 10:00\", \"9 - 10\").\n3.  **Implement a Constraint Encoding and Enforcement Module:**\n    *   **Problem:** Constraints are not reliably enforced.\n    *   **Solution:** Introduce a module that explicitly encodes the constraints in a structured format (e.g., a dictionary).  Before proposing a meeting time, the system *must* check the proposed time against the encoded constraints.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        constraints = {\n            \"Zachary\": {\"cannot_meet_after\": \"12:30\", \"day\": \"Monday\"},\n            \"Debra\": {\"prefers_not_meet\": \"Tuesday\"}\n        }\n\n        def check_constraints(proposed_time, participants, constraints):\n            # Logic to check proposed_time against constraints\n            # ...\n            return True/False\n        ```\n    *   **Integration:** Require the LLM to *explicitly call* this module before finalizing a solution.\n4.  **Add Unit Tests for Schedule Parsing and Constraint Handling:**\n    *   Create a comprehensive set of unit tests specifically targeting schedule parsing accuracy and constraint enforcement. These tests should cover a wide range of schedule formats, constraints, and edge cases.\n5.  **Introduce a Multi-Stage Solution Approach**: Break the problem down into discrete steps for which you can create specialist models. One such approach might be:\n    * Schedule Parsing Model\n    * Constraint Extraction Model\n    * Viable Time Generation\n    * Preference Selection\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, the capability trend is **stable, but low**. The system consistently struggles with the core task of schedule interpretation. Significant improvements are needed to demonstrate any upward trend.\n",

For instance, claiming 10:30-11:00 is available for some but not Noah and Matthew is incorrect given the initial availability lists.  The final proposed time is generally correct, but the path to getting there is flawed.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system appears to correctly identify that Timothy and Jeffrey do not have a full hour of overlap on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, and does manage to recommend a meeting slot that works for the two of them (Thursday, 13:00-14:00).\n*   **Sample 3:** The model makes a mistake in determining the overlaps for Monday (Debra being available from 9:00-9:30).

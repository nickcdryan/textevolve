  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM with a chain-of-thought approach: first, extracting the transformation rule from the input problem, verifying its validity, and then applying it to generate the transformed grid. The LLM acts as a pattern recognition expert, and the problem is decomposed into rule extraction, rule verification, and rule application sub-problems. The `call_llm` function interfaces with the Gemini API, `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the entire process by calling `call_llm` to get the extracted rule and apply it. The `main` function serves as the entry point, simply calling `solve_grid_transformation`.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.67 (2/3)\n*   Error samples: 1/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:**\n\n*See original report for details.*\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several key issues:\n\n*   **Sample 0 (Incorrect):** The extracted rule is a gross oversimplification of the actual transformation. The code attempts to apply a local neighborhood sum-based rule, but the output grid has inconsistent changes that are not reflected in the extracted rule. The generated grid is also not equivalent to the expected transformed grid. The system incorrectly identifies the *Rule Valid* as `True`.\n\n*   **Sample 1 (Correct):** The extracted rule accurately describes the pattern of mirroring the original grid to create a larger grid. The code correctly applies the mirroring logic, resulting in the correct transformed grid. The system correctly identifies the *Rule Valid* as `True`.\n\n*   **Sample 2 (Correct):** While complex and difficult to read, the generated Python code accurately transforms the input grid according to a fairly complex extraction logic. The system correctly identifies the *Rule Valid* as `True`. The code is complex and brittle due to the direct indexing that could easily cause bugs.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates some capacity for pattern recognition and code generation. However, its capability is highly variable and dependent on the complexity of the input. The system can handle relatively simple transformations, such as mirroring, reasonably well. However, it struggles when the rules involve multiple steps, conditional logic, or subtle dependencies. The system shows an uncanny ability to generate correct code for complex cases, though the generated code can be hard to read and brittle. The overall architecture lacks a robust solution verification mechanism, and there is a need for an effective solution verification step that assesses whether the transformed grid adheres to the extracted rules.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Identification (Simple Cases):** The system can successfully identify and apply simple grid transformation patterns.\n*   **Code Generation:** The system generates executable code based on the extracted rule, which can solve complex rules.\n*   **Explanation Generation:** The system attempts to provide a textual explanation of the transformation rule.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Rule Extraction and Generalization (Complex Cases):** The system struggles to accurately extract and generalize complex transformation rules, especially those involving conditional logic, multiple steps, or subtle dependencies.\n*   **Brittle Code Generation:** The system struggles with readability and maintainability of its generated code.\n*   **Lack of Solution Verification:** The system currently lacks a robust solution verification mechanism to independently assess the correctness of the generated output.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most crucial capability to improve is **Rule Extraction and Generalization**, especially for handling complex patterns and conditional logic. The ability to generate complex code is already there; it is the ability to extract the correct transformation that needs work.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Difference Analysis Module:** Before rule extraction, implement a module that explicitly analyzes the differences between the input and output grids. This module should highlight changed cells and attempt to identify relationships between these changes, such as spatial dependencies or conditional logic.\n\n2.  **Introduce a Structured Rule Representation:** Move away from simple string-based rule representations. Instead, consider using a more structured data format, such as a graph or a formal language, to represent the transformation rule. This structured representation should allow for the explicit encoding of conditional logic, spatial relationships, and dependencies between different grid elements.\n\n3.  **Develop Unit Tests for Code Generation:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically designed to verify that the generated code correctly implements the extracted rule. These tests should cover a wide range of scenarios and edge cases, including complex transformations with conditional logic and multiple steps. The brittle code needs to be validated rigorously.\n\n4. **Implement a Solution Verification Step:** Add a final verification step that assesses the output. A simple implementation could look at statistical properties (value distribution) of the grid and see if it's similar to the training example. More complex solutions could try to 'run the rule backwards' on the output and see if it reproduces the input grid.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance summary and the error analysis, the capability trend is currently **stable**. While the system can handle simple cases effectively, its performance on complex problems is inconsistent, indicating a need for significant improvements in rule extraction and generalization. The implementation of the above recommendations will be necessary to improve the system's overall performance and reliability.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach with techniques like question analysis and answer verification to solve a question. The problem is decomposed into identifying question type, extracting a relevant passage, generating an answer, and verifying the answer, incorporating numerical reasoning where necessary. The agent roles include an expert in question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification.\n\nThe function `main` orchestrates the process. `analyze_question` identifies the question type and keywords. `extract_relevant_passage` retrieves relevant information. `generate_answer` formulates an initial answer. `verify_answer` checks the answer for correctness, performing calculations if needed. `call_llm` is used to interact with the Gemini model and execute the prompts. The overall workflow involves sequentially calling these functions, passing the output of one as input to the next, to arrive at a verified answer.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Between 1911 and 1915, Haiti was politically unstable: a series of political assassinations and forced exiles resulted in six presidents holding office during this period. Various revolutionary armies carried out the coups. Each was formed by cacos, or peasant militia from the mountains of the north, or who invaded along the porous Dominican border. They were enlisted by rival political factions under the promises of money, which would be paid after a successful revolution, and the opportunity to plunder. The United States was particularly apprehensive about the roles  played by Imperial Germany in the Western hemisphere. Controlling Tortuga, it had intervened in Haiti  and other Caribbean nations at several times during the previous few decades to exert its influence as a rival power. Germany was increasingly hostile to United States domination of the region under its claimed Monroe Doctrine. In the lead-up to the World War I, the strategic importance of the island of Hispaniola, with its manpower, material wealth, and port facilities, was understood by almost all navies operating in the Caribbean, including Germany and the still-neutral United States. Germany had invested in military and intelligence gathering across Hispaniola as part of a wider network of German interest in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 1890s through the 1910s. The United States' concern over Germany's ambitions was mirrored by apprehension and rivalry between American businessmen and the small German community in Haiti, which although numbering only about 200 in 1910 wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. German nationals controlled about 80 percent of the country's international commerce. They owned and operated utilities in Cap-Ha\u00eften and Port-au-Prince, including the main wharf and a tramway in the capital, and also had built the railway serving the Plain of the Cul-de-Sac.\n\nQUESTION: what percent of Hispaniola did the germans own?",

He compares wages and the standard of living in Pittsburgh with Birmingham, England. He finds that, after taking into account the cost of living , the standard of living of unskilled workers was about the same in the two cities, while skilled workers had about twice as high a standard of living. The American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and there was a heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America.  Shergold revealed that skilled Americans did earn higher wages than the British, yet unskilled workers did not, while Americans worked longer hours, with a greater chance of injury, and had fewer social services. Nationwide from 1890 to 1914 the unionized wages in manufacturing rose from $17.63 a week to $21.37, and the average work week fell from 54.4 to 48.8 hours a week. The pay for all factory workers was $11.94 and $15.84 because unions reached only the more skilled factory workers.",

The output correctly identifies the *provided answer* as incorrect because the passage refers to \"Haiti\" while the question refers to \"Hispaniola.\" However, the underlying AI system likely made that same error in its original reasoning, causing the initial misinterpretation.\n*   **Sample 1:** This execution demonstrates accurate calculation and a reasonable understanding of the question. The steps are clearly laid out. This represents a successful case where the system correctly extracts, manipulates, and combines numerical data.\n*   **Sample 2:** This execution also showcases accurate calculation and the ability to handle a simple constraint (subtracting from 100%). The system clearly states the reasoning and arrives at the correct answer.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates mixed capabilities. It possesses strengths in basic arithmetic, logical reasoning, and some constraint handling. However, its semantic understanding and information extraction capabilities are significantly lacking, leading to errors in cases requiring contextual awareness and nuanced comprehension. The ability to perform calculations accurately is negated when applied to incorrectly extracted information.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Arithmetic Precision:** The system is generally accurate in its calculations.\n*   **Logical Step-by-Step Reasoning:** The system can articulate its reasoning process.\n*   **Simple Constraint Application:** The system can handle basic constraints like subtracting from 100%.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Deficient Semantic Understanding:** The system struggles to understand the nuances and context of the questions.\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** The system often extracts the wrong information from the passage.\n*   **Confusion of Similar Concepts:** The system struggles to differentiate between similar entities or concepts.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **semantic understanding**. Without accurate semantic understanding, all other capabilities are undermined by operating on incorrect information. This is the foundation upon which successful reasoning and problem-solving are built.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Contextual Keyword Analysis with Dependency Parsing:** Enhance the keyword analysis module to include dependency parsing. This will help the system understand the *relationships* between keywords and entities.  For example, in the Haiti/Hispaniola example, dependency parsing would reveal which nouns are modifying \"commerce\" and help the system distinguish between \"Haiti's commerce\" and \"Hispaniola's commerce.\"\n2.  **Integrate an Entity Linking Module with Disambiguation:** Implement an entity linking module that connects entities mentioned in the passage to external knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia, Wikidata). This will allow the system to resolve ambiguities. This would allow it to link \"Haiti\" and \"Hispaniola\" and show their relationship is related to being on the same island, but being separate entities.\n3.  **Develop a Question Decomposition Module:** Break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions. This will force the system to address each component of the question individually, reducing the chances of misinterpreting the overall intent. For example, the Haiti/Hispaniola question could be broken into sub-questions: \"What is the question asking about?\" and \"What does the passage say about that?\".\n4.  **Implement a Targeted Example-Based Training Regime:** Create a dataset of examples specifically designed to address the identified weaknesses. This dataset should include:\n    *   Questions that test the system's ability to differentiate between similar entities.\n    *   Questions that require a deep understanding of the context.\n    *   Questions that are phrased in multiple ways to test the system's robustness.\n5.  **Debug Print Statements:** Insert print statements to view extracted variables, retrieved values, and the system's intermediate reasoning steps for error cases. This detailed logging will provide more insight into what went wrong and where the system failed to extract and retrieve the appropriate data.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, the error analysis reveals that the system consistently struggles with semantic understanding, suggesting that this deficiency is a stable issue. Without targeted interventions, the system's capabilities in this area are unlikely to improve significantly. Improvement in semantic understanding will likely show marked improvements to accuracy rates as the math is typically correct when given the appropriate data.\n",

The ability to perform calculations accurately is negated when applied to incorrectly extracted information.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Arithmetic Precision:** The system is generally accurate in its calculations.\n*   **Logical Step-by-Step Reasoning:** The system can articulate its reasoning process.\n*   **Simple Constraint Application:** The system can handle basic constraints like subtracting from 100%.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Deficient Semantic Understanding:** The system struggles to understand the nuances and context of the questions.\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** The system often extracts the wrong information from the passage.\n*   **Confusion of Similar Concepts:** The system struggles to differentiate between similar entities or concepts.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **semantic understanding**. Without accurate semantic understanding, all other capabilities are undermined by operating on incorrect information. This is the foundation upon which successful reasoning and problem-solving are built.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Contextual Keyword Analysis with Dependency Parsing:** Enhance the keyword analysis module to include dependency parsing. This will help the system understand the *relationships* between keywords and entities.  For example, in the Haiti/Hispaniola example, dependency parsing would reveal which nouns are modifying \"commerce\" and help the system distinguish between \"Haiti's commerce\" and \"Hispaniola's commerce.\"\n2.  **Integrate an Entity Linking Module with Disambiguation:** Implement an entity linking module that connects entities mentioned in the passage to external knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia, Wikidata). This will allow the system to resolve ambiguities. This would allow it to link \"Haiti\" and \"Hispaniola\" and show their relationship is related to being on the same island, but being separate entities.\n3.  **Develop a Question Decomposition Module:** Break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions. This will force the system to address each component of the question individually, reducing the chances of misinterpreting the overall intent. For example, the Haiti/Hispaniola question could be broken into sub-questions: \"What is the question asking about?\" and \"What does the passage say about that?\".\n4.  **Implement a Targeted Example-Based Training Regime:** Create a dataset of examples specifically designed to address the identified weaknesses. This dataset should include:\n    *   Questions that test the system's ability to differentiate between similar entities.\n    *   Questions that require a deep understanding of the context.\n    *   Questions that are phrased in multiple ways to test the system's robustness.\n5.  **Debug Print Statements:** Insert print statements to view extracted variables, retrieved values, and the system's intermediate reasoning steps for error cases. This detailed logging will provide more insight into what went wrong and where the system failed to extract and retrieve the appropriate data.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, the error analysis reveals that the system consistently struggles with semantic understanding, suggesting that this deficiency is a stable issue. Without targeted interventions, the system's capabilities in this area are unlikely to improve significantly. Improvement in semantic understanding will likely show marked improvements to accuracy rates as the math is typically correct when given the appropriate data.\n"

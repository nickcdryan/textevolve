The hypothesis is that transformations are driven by key \"anchor\" values, and their proximity determines how other cells change. A neighborhood influence propagation technique will be employed.\n\nThis approach differs from previous ones by:\n\n1. Focusing on \"anchor\" values: The script will find key values that are most frequent in the training examples and apply a transformation based on what happens to their neighborhood\n2.  Influence Propagation: The script will find patterns between \"anchor\" values and how nearby cells change\n3. Applying neighborhood change based on influence: A process to extract the test matrix and transform the neighborhood with the identified influence propagations\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union\n\ndef call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):\n    \"\"\"Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        from google import genai\n        from google.genai import types\n\n        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"))\n\n        if system_instruction:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n                    system_instruction=system_instruction\n                ),\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n        else:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n\n        return response.text\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}\")\n        return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n\ndef identify_anchor_values(question: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Identifies anchor values from the training examples.\"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"You are an expert in identifying key values in grid transformations.\n    Analyze the training examples in the following question to identify the most frequent values, or \"anchor\" values, that seem to drive the transformations.\n\n    Example:\n    question: === TRAINING EXAMPLES === Example 1: Input Grid: [[1, 2], [3, 4]] Output Grid: [[2, 3], [4, 1]] === TEST INPUT === [[5, 6], [7, 8]] Transform the test input.\n    Anchor Values: 1, 2, 3, 4 (all values appear to be equally important).\n\n\tquestion: === TRAINING EXAMPLES === Example 1: Input Grid: [[0, 0], [0, 4]] Output Grid: [[4, 4], [4, 4]] === TEST INPUT === [[0, 0], [0, 0]] Transform the test input.\n    Anchor Values: 4 (4 seems to propagate).\n\n    question: {question}\n    Anchor Values:\"\"\"\n    anchor_values = call_llm(prompt)\n    return anchor_values\n\ndef analyze_neighborhood_influence(question: str, anchor_values: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Analyzes how anchor values influence their neighboring cells.\"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"You are an expert at analyzing grid transformations.\n    Analyze the training examples in the following question and determine how the identified anchor values influence their neighboring cells in the output grid.\n\n    Example:\n    question: === TRAINING EXAMPLES === Example 1: Input Grid: [[0, 0], [0, 4]] Output Grid: [[4, 4], [4, 4]] === TEST INPUT === [[5, 6], [7, 8]] Transform the test input.\n    Anchor Values: 4\n    Neighborhood Influence: The value '4' seems to propagate to all neighboring cells, replacing their original values.\n\n    question: {question}\n    Anchor Values: {anchor_values}\n    Neighborhood Influence:\"\"\"\n    neighborhood_influence = call_llm(prompt)\n    return neighborhood_influence\n\ndef transform_grid(input_grid: str, anchor_values: str, neighborhood_influence: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Transforms the input grid based on anchor values and their neighborhood influence.\"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"You are an expert in applying grid transformations.\n    Apply the transformation to the provided input grid, based on the anchor values and their influence on neighboring cells.\n\n    Example:\n    input_grid: [[5, 6], [7, 8]]\n    anchor_values: 8\n    neighborhood_influence: The value '8' seems to shift values left\n    Transformed Grid: [[6, 5], [8, 7]]\n\n    input_grid: {input_grid}\n    anchor_values: {anchor_values}\n    neighborhood_influence: {neighborhood_influence}\n    Transformed Grid:\"\"\"\n    transformed_grid = call_llm(prompt)\n    return transformed_grid\n\ndef main(question: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Main function to solve the problem.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by identifying \"anchor\" values and propagating their influence to neighboring cells using an LLM. The problem is decomposed into identifying anchor values, analyzing neighborhood influence, and transforming the input grid. Three distinct agent roles are implicitly defined within the prompt of the functions: an expert in identifying key values, an expert at analyzing grid transformations, and an expert in applying grid transformations. The script uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini LLM. The function calls are structured as follows: `identify_anchor_values` -> `analyze_neighborhood_influence` -> `transform_grid`, with the output of each function serving as input for the subsequent one; regex is used to extract the test input. Overall, the script extracts the test grid, identifies anchor values and their influence using the LLM, then transforms the test grid based on this analysis.",

The system hallucinates values, propagating numbers that are not present in the original grid or training examples. While the code executes without runtime errors, the generated solutions are consistently incorrect. There's also inconsistency in the application of the patterns; some areas that should be transformed are left untouched, while others are transformed incorrectly. The explanations provided alongside the generated grids also contain inaccuracies regarding the system's understanding and application of the transformation rules.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently exhibits very low accuracy in solving the grid transformation tasks. While it demonstrates basic pattern recognition and constraint awareness (e.g., not changing the middle column), its primary capability is significantly hindered by inaccurate pattern application and hallucination of values. It appears to have difficulty understanding the subtle nuances of the transformation rules and consistently deviates from the demonstrated patterns.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Pattern Recognition:** The system shows an initial capability to identify patterns present in training examples.\n*   **Constraint Awareness:** The system understands that the middle column should not be transformed.\n*   **Value sampling and Propogation:** The system is able to identify the initial values and use them to fill other spaces in the matrix.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Hallucination:** The system generates values outside the valid range present in the initial grid.\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Application:** The system applies the demonstrated pattern from the training examples incorrectly, leading to deviations from the golden answers.\n*   **Misunderstanding of scope:** The system does not apply changes on all locations where they need to be implemented based on the training examples.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate value propagation and generation** while respecting the value range constraints.

If the value is not present, the propagation should be skipped, or a different value should be sampled according to the defined transformation rule. This will directly address the hallucination problem.\n2.  **Refine Neighborhood Logic with Specificity:** The current logic for determining which values to propagate needs to be more precise. Instead of relying on broad rules, the system should explicitly define how values from certain locations in the training examples should influence transformations in the target grid. Add explicit logic to handle edge cases and special scenarios based on the training data.\n3.  **Error Analysis-Driven Training Data Augmentation:** Analyze the error cases in detail and create new training examples specifically designed to address the weaknesses identified. Focus on creating examples that force the system to learn the correct patterns of value propagation and respect range constraints.\n4.  **Iterative Testing and Validation:** After implementing the above recommendations, conduct thorough testing using a diverse set of grid transformation tasks. Carefully analyze the results and iterate on the logic until the system consistently generates correct solutions without hallucinating values.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**.

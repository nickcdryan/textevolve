On 21 January 1466, the Dukes and the Elector concluded the Treaty of Soldin, in which the Elector enfeoffed the Dukes with Pomerania and they recognised him as their liege lord. The Pomeranian Dukes, however, did not meet their treaty obligations and the conflict erupted again. In 1468, Brandenburg captured several Pomeranian towns on both sides of the Oder. After an unsuccessful siege of Ueckerm\u00fcnde, the two sides agreed to a cease-fire. Peace negotiations in Piotrk\u00f3w Kujawski only resulted in an extension of the cease-fire. In May 1470, Eric II invaded the Neumark and started looting. In the meantime, Emperor Frederick III acknowledged the claims of Brandenburg. The emperor enfeoffed Frederick II with Pomerania-Stettin and order Eric II and Wartislaw X to recognise Frederick as their liege lord. Duke Henry IV of Mecklenburg mediation, and at the end of May 1472, a lasting peace treaty was signed at Prenzlau. The Dukes and the Estates of Pomerania had to pay homage to the Frederick II, who was also allowed to keep the territories he had conquered. The Dukes retained a number of law professors from the University of Greifswald to review the peace treaty. Among them were Johannes Parleberg, Matthias von Wedel, Sabel Siegfried the Younger, Hermann Slupwachter, Johann Elzing, Heinrich Zankenstede and Georg Walter.

With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game.

At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game. During this game, the Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea, TE Dallas Clark and OT Ryan Diem all to injuries in the first half, and they did not return.\n\nQUESTION: How many touchdowns did Joseph Addai score in the first half?\n    Passage: The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai.

The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game. With their second consecutive overtime loss, the Steelers fell to 6-5.\n\nQUESTION: How many more points did the Ravens score than the Steelers?\n      Answer: 1\n      Passage: The Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11 yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game.\n\n      Calculation:\n      ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert at verifying answers to questions, including performing calculations when needed."}, "output": "Calculation: McGahee TD: 7 points.

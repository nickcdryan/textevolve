  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by employing a two-agent system: an Extraction Agent and a Scheduling Agent, each with a validation step. The Extraction Agent extracts meeting details using multi-example prompting and an LLM-based validation step. The Scheduling Agent then uses the extracted information to propose a meeting time, which is also validated by the LLM.\n\nThe overall workflow involves calling `extract_meeting_info` to extract details, followed by `schedule_meeting` to propose a valid meeting time. The `call_llm` function is used within both agents to interact with the LLM, while validations are performed within each agent to ensure accuracy and adherence to constraints. The `main` function orchestrates this process, handling exceptions and returning the final scheduled meeting time.",

In Sample 2, the system fails to exclude Tuesday even though it's explicitly stated Laura cannot meet on that day. Sample 3 shows difficulty in dealing with preferences (George doesn't want to meet after 12:30 on Monday, Carl wants to avoid Tuesday and Wednesday).\n- **Solution Verification:** Even if a solution is generated, the system appears to lack robust verification mechanisms to ensure it adheres to all constraints (Samples 0 and 3).\n- **Extraction Refinement:** While the system attempts to refine extractions based on validation errors (Sample 2), it often fails to converge to a correct extraction, getting stuck in a loop of validation failures.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Constraint Integration in Extraction:** The system's inability to immediately incorporate constraints during the initial extraction process is a significant bottleneck. This leads to inaccurate data fed into the subsequent scheduling logic.\n- **Verification Feedback Loop Effectiveness:** The feedback loop for solution verification is either not present or not effective enough. Solutions are proposed which violate stated constraints.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- **Misinterpreting \"negative\" constraints:** The most common pattern is failing to properly deal with constraints phrased in the negative (\"cannot meet on\", \"would rather not meet\"). These constraints are often ignored or misinterpreted.\n- **Extraction validation failure loops:** The system gets stuck in loops, unable to correct initial extraction errors.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe system's primary issue is its **inability to fully integrate constraints, especially negative constraints, directly into the information extraction and solution generation steps**. The constraint handling is insufficient. It needs to be addressed at the earliest stages to prevent errors from propagating through the system.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Constraint Handling:** Major improvement needed to correctly interpret and apply constraints, especially negative ones.\n- **Solution Generation:** The solution generation process must consider all constraints, including preferences, to produce valid meeting times.\n- **Information Extraction:** The system needs to be more robust in extracting all relevant information, including constraints and preferences.\n- **Extraction Refinement Loop Logic:** The logic of the feedback loop that refines the extraction results needs to be improved, including making the LLM better at understanding the meaning of the validations. It must be designed to break out of validation failure loops.\n- **Prompt engineering and few-shot examples**: The LLM needs better prompts for information extraction and solution validation. More few-shot examples of negative constraints would be very helpful.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Modify Extraction Prompt:**\n    - Change the extraction prompt to explicitly ask for a list of positive constraints (available meeting times) AND a list of negative constraints (times *not* available).\n    - Provide examples in the prompt that show how to represent negative constraints.\n    - Incorporate few-shot examples with various kinds of negative constraints (\"cannot meet on\", \"prefers not to meet\", \"only available before\", \"must be after\").\n2. **Revise Solution Generation to Prioritize Constraints:**\n    - Before generating any potential solutions, the system should first explicitly list out all constraints.\n    - The solution generation prompt must emphasize adherence to *all* constraints as the highest priority.\n3. **Enhance Solution Verification:**\n    - The verification step should include a separate constraint checker that explicitly verifies whether each constraint is satisfied.\n    - If any constraint is violated, the verification process should provide detailed feedback on which constraint failed and how.\n4. **Extraction Refinement Loop Improvement:**\n    - When the validation fails, incorporate more information into the refinement prompt, including the original question, previous extraction, validation errors, and specific examples of correct extraction.\n    - Add a mechanism to track the number of failed validation attempts and break out of the loop after a certain threshold (e.g., 3 attempts) to prevent infinite loops.\n5. **Robust JSON Handling:**\n    - Surround JSON parsing with try-except blocks to catch JSONDecodeError.\n    - Add a max_attempts loop for JSON extraction similar to what is already implemented elsewhere.\n    - If JSON parsing consistently fails, implement a more robust parsing strategy or fall back to string parsing (with appropriate warnings and logging).\n6. **Input Dependent Processing**:\n    - Problems that contain negative constraints such as Laura's availability in Sample 2 should be routed to a processing pathway that is designed specifically to address such constraints.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample 0:** constraint_handling, solution_verification, decision_making\n- **Sample 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n- **Sample 3:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, I will provide a thorough capability assessment based on the provided information.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues that directly align with the Error Analysis Report.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The output suggests a potential meeting time. However, without the initial question it is impossible to determine if the constraint was met.\n*   **Sample 2:** The extraction validation failures clearly demonstrate the inability to handle negative constraints (\"Laura cannot meet on Tuesday\"). The system gets stuck in a loop, repeatedly failing to remove Tuesday from consideration, despite the explicit negative constraint and the explicit error messages during validation. This highlights a deficiency in the extraction refinement logic. The fact that the validation attempts are *explicitly pointing out* the error to the LLM and the LLM still fails to correct it demonstrates the LLM is not properly understanding the error and fixing it.\n*   **Reasoning for Sample 2:** There is the mention of incorrect days from the prompt, and even the explanation admits the days are incorrect, but the system is still unable to break out of the failure and solve the problem. This clearly demonstrates the need to address constraint handling.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic capabilities in identifying participants and time constraints. However, its capability to generate valid solutions is severely limited by its inability to effectively handle constraints, particularly negative constraints. The extraction refinement loop shows promise but is currently ineffective due to a lack of convergence. Solution verification is inadequate.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Participant Identification:** The system generally correctly identifies participants in the scheduling request.\n*   **Initial Constraint Recognition:** The system often extracts *some* constraints, even though it may not process them correctly.\n*   **Attempted Extraction Validation:** The presence of an extraction validation loop indicates a recognition of the need for error correction, even if the current implementation is flawed.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Negative Constraint Handling:** This is the most critical weakness. The system consistently fails to correctly interpret and apply negative constraints (\"cannot meet on\").\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust mechanism to verify that generated solutions adhere to *all* specified constraints.\n*   **Extraction Refinement Loop Effectiveness:** The extraction refinement loop is ineffective, often getting stuck in validation failure cycles.\n*   **Insufficient LLM Prompting:** The LLM prompting does not create the conditions for the LLM to successfully reason about and correct invalid extractions or provide valid schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **constraint handling**, specifically the ability to correctly interpret and apply *negative* constraints and preferences throughout the entire process, from information extraction to solution verification.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement the \"Negative Constraint\" Extraction Prompt Modification (Priority: High):**\n    *   Modify the extraction prompt to *explicitly* ask for lists of positive and negative constraints, with clear examples of how to represent both. This makes negative constraints a first-class citizen in the extraction process.\n    *   Incorporate several *diverse* few-shot examples demonstrating different ways negative constraints can be expressed (\"cannot meet on\", \"prefers not to meet\", \"only available before\", \"must be after\"). Make sure the examples demonstrate how to handle these constraints to extract them and create a solution.\n2.  **Implement the Enhanced Solution Verification (Priority: High):**\n    *   Add a *separate constraint checker* as part of the verification process. This checker should *explicitly verify* whether *each* constraint (positive and negative) is satisfied by the proposed solution.\n    *   If a constraint is violated, the checker should provide *specific, detailed feedback* indicating which constraint failed and how. This feedback should be used to refine future solutions.\n3.  **Improve the Extraction Refinement Loop Logic (Priority: High):**\n    *   When the validation fails, incorporate as much context as possible into the refinement prompt: the *original question*, the *previous extraction*, the *specific validation errors*, and *examples* of correct extractions. The LLM needs more context to understand *why* its extraction is wrong.\n    *   Add a mechanism to *track the number of failed validation attempts* and *break out of the loop* after a certain threshold (e.g., 3 attempts) to prevent infinite loops. Add logging to indicate when these loops occur.\n4.  **Route Inputs with Negative Constraints (Priority: Medium)**\n    *   Implement dynamic input routing so that problems with explicit negative constraints are routed to a specialized processing path that has been created specifically to handle such constraints.\n5.  **Implement a Robust JSON Handling Strategy (Priority: Medium):**\n    *   Surround *all* JSON parsing with `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle `JSONDecodeError`.\n    *   Implement a `max_attempts` loop for JSON extraction, retrying with increasingly specific prompts if parsing fails initially. Add logging to indicate when errors occur.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the system's capability is currently **stable, but at a low level of performance**. The accuracy is only 40%, and the presence of extraction failure loops indicates a significant weakness that needs to be addressed. While the system demonstrates some initial strengths, it needs substantial improvements to achieve a higher level of reliability and effectiveness. The attempt to perform validation is a strong indicator, but the implementation is ineffective at the current time.\n",

Solutions are proposed which violate stated constraints.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- **Misinterpreting \"negative\" constraints:** The most common pattern is failing to properly deal with constraints phrased in the negative (\"cannot meet on\", \"would rather not meet\"). These constraints are often ignored or misinterpreted.\n- **Extraction validation failure loops:** The system gets stuck in loops, unable to correct initial extraction errors.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe system's primary issue is its **inability to fully integrate constraints, especially negative constraints, directly into the information extraction and solution generation steps**. The constraint handling is insufficient. It needs to be addressed at the earliest stages to prevent errors from propagating through the system.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Constraint Handling:** Major improvement needed to correctly interpret and apply constraints, especially negative ones.\n- **Solution Generation:** The solution generation process must consider all constraints, including preferences, to produce valid meeting times.\n- **Information Extraction:** The system needs to be more robust in extracting all relevant information, including constraints and preferences.\n- **Extraction Refinement Loop Logic:** The logic of the feedback loop that refines the extraction results needs to be improved, including making the LLM better at understanding the meaning of the validations. It must be designed to break out of validation failure loops.\n- **Prompt engineering and few-shot examples**: The LLM needs better prompts for information extraction and solution validation. More few-shot examples of negative constraints would be very helpful.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Modify Extraction Prompt:**\n    - Change the extraction prompt to explicitly ask for a list of positive constraints (available meeting times) AND a list of negative constraints (times *not* available).\n    - Provide examples in the prompt that show how to represent negative constraints.\n    - Incorporate few-shot examples with various kinds of negative constraints (\"cannot meet on\", \"prefers not to meet\", \"only available before\", \"must be after\").\n2. **Revise Solution Generation to Prioritize Constraints:**\n    - Before generating any potential solutions, the system should first explicitly list out all constraints.\n    - The solution generation prompt must emphasize adherence to *all* constraints as the highest priority.\n3. **Enhance Solution Verification:**\n    - The verification step should include a separate constraint checker that explicitly verifies whether each constraint is satisfied.\n    - If any constraint is violated, the verification process should provide detailed feedback on which constraint failed and how.\n4. **Extraction Refinement Loop Improvement:**\n    - When the validation fails, incorporate more information into the refinement prompt, including the original question, previous extraction, validation errors, and specific examples of correct extraction.\n    - Add a mechanism to track the number of failed validation attempts and break out of the loop after a certain threshold (e.g., 3 attempts) to prevent infinite loops.\n5. **Robust JSON Handling:**\n    - Surround JSON parsing with try-except blocks to catch JSONDecodeError.\n    - Add a max_attempts loop for JSON extraction similar to what is already implemented elsewhere.\n    - If JSON parsing consistently fails, implement a more robust parsing strategy or fall back to string parsing (with appropriate warnings and logging).\n6. **Input Dependent Processing**:\n    - Problems that contain negative constraints such as Laura's availability in Sample 2 should be routed to a processing pathway that is designed specifically to address such constraints.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample 0:** constraint_handling, solution_verification, decision_making\n- **Sample 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n- **Sample 3:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, I will provide a thorough capability assessment based on the provided information.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues that directly align with the Error Analysis Report.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The output suggests a potential meeting time. However, without the initial question it is impossible to determine if the constraint was met.\n*   **Sample 2:** The extraction validation failures clearly demonstrate the inability to handle negative constraints (\"Laura cannot meet on Tuesday\"). The system gets stuck in a loop, repeatedly failing to remove Tuesday from consideration, despite the explicit negative constraint and the explicit error messages during validation. This highlights a deficiency in the extraction refinement logic. The fact that the validation attempts are *explicitly pointing out* the error to the LLM and the LLM still fails to correct it demonstrates the LLM is not properly understanding the error and fixing it.\n*   **Reasoning for Sample 2:** There is the mention of incorrect days from the prompt, and even the explanation admits the days are incorrect, but the system is still unable to break out of the failure and solve the problem. This clearly demonstrates the need to address constraint handling.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic capabilities in identifying participants and time constraints. However, its capability to generate valid solutions is severely limited by its inability to effectively handle constraints, particularly negative constraints. The extraction refinement loop shows promise but is currently ineffective due to a lack of convergence. Solution verification is inadequate.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Participant Identification:** The system generally correctly identifies participants in the scheduling request.\n*   **Initial Constraint Recognition:** The system often extracts *some* constraints, even though it may not process them correctly.\n*   **Attempted Extraction Validation:** The presence of an extraction validation loop indicates a recognition of the need for error correction, even if the current implementation is flawed.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Negative Constraint Handling:** This is the most critical weakness. The system consistently fails to correctly interpret and apply negative constraints (\"cannot meet on\").\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust mechanism to verify that generated solutions adhere to *all* specified constraints.\n*   **Extraction Refinement Loop Effectiveness:** The extraction refinement loop is ineffective, often getting stuck in validation failure cycles.\n*   **Insufficient LLM Prompting:** The LLM prompting does not create the conditions for the LLM to successfully reason about and correct invalid extractions or provide valid schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **constraint handling**, specifically the ability to correctly interpret and apply *negative* constraints and preferences throughout the entire process, from information extraction to solution verification.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement the \"Negative Constraint\" Extraction Prompt Modification (Priority: High):**\n    *   Modify the extraction prompt to *explicitly* ask for lists of positive and negative constraints, with clear examples of how to represent both. This makes negative constraints a first-class citizen in the extraction process.\n    *   Incorporate several *diverse* few-shot examples demonstrating different ways negative constraints can be expressed (\"cannot meet on\", \"prefers not to meet\", \"only available before\", \"must be after\"). Make sure the examples demonstrate how to handle these constraints to extract them and create a solution.\n2.  **Implement the Enhanced Solution Verification (Priority: High):**\n    *   Add a *separate constraint checker* as part of the verification process. This checker should *explicitly verify* whether *each* constraint (positive and negative) is satisfied by the proposed solution.\n    *   If a constraint is violated, the checker should provide *specific, detailed feedback* indicating which constraint failed and how. This feedback should be used to refine future solutions.\n3.  **Improve the Extraction Refinement Loop Logic (Priority: High):**\n    *   When the validation fails, incorporate as much context as possible into the refinement prompt: the *original question*, the *previous extraction*, the *specific validation errors*, and *examples* of correct extractions. The LLM needs more context to understand *why* its extraction is wrong.\n    *   Add a mechanism to *track the number of failed validation attempts* and *break out of the loop* after a certain threshold (e.g., 3 attempts) to prevent infinite loops. Add logging to indicate when these loops occur.\n4.  **Route Inputs with Negative Constraints (Priority: Medium)**\n    *   Implement dynamic input routing so that problems with explicit negative constraints are routed to a specialized processing path that has been created specifically to handle such constraints.\n5.  **Implement a Robust JSON Handling Strategy (Priority: Medium):**\n    *   Surround *all* JSON parsing with `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle `JSONDecodeError`.\n    *   Implement a `max_attempts` loop for JSON extraction, retrying with increasingly specific prompts if parsing fails initially. Add logging to indicate when errors occur.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the system's capability is currently **stable, but at a low level of performance**. The accuracy is only 40%, and the presence of extraction failure loops indicates a significant weakness that needs to be addressed. While the system demonstrates some initial strengths, it needs substantial improvements to achieve a higher level of reliability and effectiveness. The attempt to perform validation is a strong indicator, but the implementation is ineffective at the current time.\n"

  "approach_summary": "This script employs a two-stage retrieval and focused summarization approach, enhanced with a self-reflection mechanism, to answer questions using the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into three distinct stages: initial information retrieval, focused summarization, and self-reflection validation. The script defines the functions `initial_info_retrieval`, `focused_summarization`, and `self_reflection_validation`, each acting as an agent with a specific role (information retrieval, summarization, and validation, respectively), while `call_llm` sends the prompt to the LLM and retrieves a response, and `main` orchestrates the entire process. The `main` function first calls `initial_info_retrieval` to get background information, then passes this and the original question to `focused_summarization`, and finally uses `self_reflection_validation` to validate and answer the question.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**System Version:** (Assuming this is the first assessment, we'll call it v1.0)\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Analyst:** AI System Capability Analyst\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently return \"Could not be validated.\" This indicates a systemic failure in the process of retrieving, processing, or validating information required to generate answers. The absence of more specific error messages makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact stage where the process is failing. The uniformity of the errors across all samples suggests a core issue, not just isolated incidents of failure. The ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END tags are present, indicating the code is executing properly to the point of returning *something*. However, the \"Could not be validated\" message within these tags is the key indicator of failure.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capability. With an accuracy of 0.00, it essentially fails to answer any of the tested questions. The system *attempts* to retrieve and validate information, as evidenced by the structured output format and the consistent error message, but it consistently fails in this process.\n\nOverall, the system can be considered to be in a pre-alpha stage.  It has some basic architecture for handling questions and returning answers but lacks the core functionality of reliably providing *correct* answers.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Output:** The system produces a structured output (using ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END tags) even when it fails. This is important for downstream processing and error handling.\n*   **Error Handling (Basic):** The system doesn't crash or throw exceptions; instead, it provides a consistent error message. While the message is vague, it's preferable to a system that halts unexpectedly.\n*   **Problem Statement Parsing:** The system appears capable of parsing the question, identifying requirements, and attempting to retrieve data.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval Failure:** The most critical weakness is the system's inability to retrieve the information necessary to answer questions.\n*   **Information Validation Failure:** Even if information is retrieved, the system cannot validate it, suggesting a potential issue with data integrity or relevance checks.\n*   **Vague Error Reporting:** The \"Could not be validated\" error message provides no actionable insight into the cause of the failure.\n*   **Numerical Data Handling**: Appears to have significant problems when numerical answers are expected.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Retrieval and Validation**. Until the system can reliably retrieve and validate information, it cannot function effectively. Specifically, providing *actionable* validation failure messages is critical.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Granular Error Reporting:** Replace the generic \"Could not be validated\" message with specific error codes and messages. For example:\n    *   \"ERROR_CODE: IR-001 - Could not find relevant information for query: [query]\"\n    *   \"ERROR_CODE: IR-002 - Retrieved data does not match expected format: [expected format], [actual format]\"\n    *   \"ERROR_CODE: IR-003 - Validation check failed: Retrieved value [value] is outside acceptable range [range]\"\n    *   \"ERROR_CODE: IR-004 - Failed to extract numeric information\"\n    This will provide valuable insights into *why* validation is failing.\n\n2.  **Review and Refine Information Retrieval Logic:**\n    *   **Examine search queries:** Log the exact search queries used for each question. Are they correctly formulated? Are they specific enough?\n    *   **Evaluate data sources:** Are the data sources reliable and up-to-date? Are the APIs used to access these sources functioning correctly?\n    *   **Implement alternative search strategies:** Explore multiple search engines or data sources to improve the chances of finding relevant information.\n\n3.  **Implement Data Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Data type validation:** Ensure the retrieved data matches the expected data type (e.g., number, date, string).\n    *   **Range validation:** Verify that numeric values fall within acceptable ranges.\n    *   **Consistency checks:** Cross-validate retrieved data with other sources to ensure consistency.\n\n4.  **Debugging and Logging Enhancement:** Implement extensive logging of the information retrieval and validation process. This should include:\n    *   The original question\n    *   The search queries used\n    *   The retrieved data\n    *   The validation checks performed\n    *   The outcome of each validation check\n    *   Any errors or exceptions encountered\n\n5.  **Address Numeric Data Handling Specifically:** Focus attention on sample IDs 1 and 2 as they contain numeric output. Examine the numerical data structure used to represent expected and received answers, and comparisons in validation checks.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is **Stable (but critically low)**. The system consistently fails, indicating a lack of progress. The implementation of the above actionable recommendations will be critical to initiating a positive trend.\n",

For example, check the data type, range, or format of the answer.\n4.  **Implement Detailed Logging:** Add detailed logging to track the information retrieval and validation process. Log the search queries, retrieved data, validation checks performed, and any errors encountered.\n5.  **Implement Caching:** Implement a caching mechanism for frequently accessed information to reduce the reliance on external sources and improve performance.\n6.  **Debug numerical question failures separately**: Focus attention on why the numbers are failing. Is it because of a particular data structure used for number representation and comparisons?\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**System Version:** (Assuming this is the first assessment, we'll call it v1.0)\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Analyst:** AI System Capability Analyst\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently return \"Could not be validated.\" This indicates a systemic failure in the process of retrieving, processing, or validating information required to generate answers. The absence of more specific error messages makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact stage where the process is failing. The uniformity of the errors across all samples suggests a core issue, not just isolated incidents of failure. The ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END tags are present, indicating the code is executing properly to the point of returning *something*. However, the \"Could not be validated\" message within these tags is the key indicator of failure.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capability. With an accuracy of 0.00, it essentially fails to answer any of the tested questions. The system *attempts* to retrieve and validate information, as evidenced by the structured output format and the consistent error message, but it consistently fails in this process.\n\nOverall, the system can be considered to be in a pre-alpha stage.  It has some basic architecture for handling questions and returning answers but lacks the core functionality of reliably providing *correct* answers.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Output:** The system produces a structured output (using ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END tags) even when it fails. This is important for downstream processing and error handling.\n*   **Error Handling (Basic):** The system doesn't crash or throw exceptions; instead, it provides a consistent error message. While the message is vague, it's preferable to a system that halts unexpectedly.\n*   **Problem Statement Parsing:** The system appears capable of parsing the question, identifying requirements, and attempting to retrieve data.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval Failure:** The most critical weakness is the system's inability to retrieve the information necessary to answer questions.\n*   **Information Validation Failure:** Even if information is retrieved, the system cannot validate it, suggesting a potential issue with data integrity or relevance checks.\n*   **Vague Error Reporting:** The \"Could not be validated\" error message provides no actionable insight into the cause of the failure.\n*   **Numerical Data Handling**: Appears to have significant problems when numerical answers are expected.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Retrieval and Validation**. Until the system can reliably retrieve and validate information, it cannot function effectively. Specifically, providing *actionable* validation failure messages is critical.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Granular Error Reporting:** Replace the generic \"Could not be validated\" message with specific error codes and messages. For example:\n    *   \"ERROR_CODE: IR-001 - Could not find relevant information for query: [query]\"\n    *   \"ERROR_CODE: IR-002 - Retrieved data does not match expected format: [expected format], [actual format]\"\n    *   \"ERROR_CODE: IR-003 - Validation check failed: Retrieved value [value] is outside acceptable range [range]\"\n    *   \"ERROR_CODE: IR-004 - Failed to extract numeric information\"\n    This will provide valuable insights into *why* validation is failing.\n\n2.  **Review and Refine Information Retrieval Logic:**\n    *   **Examine search queries:** Log the exact search queries used for each question. Are they correctly formulated? Are they specific enough?\n    *   **Evaluate data sources:** Are the data sources reliable and up-to-date? Are the APIs used to access these sources functioning correctly?\n    *   **Implement alternative search strategies:** Explore multiple search engines or data sources to improve the chances of finding relevant information.\n\n3.  **Implement Data Validation Checks:**\n    *   **Data type validation:** Ensure the retrieved data matches the expected data type (e.g., number, date, string).\n    *   **Range validation:** Verify that numeric values fall within acceptable ranges.\n    *   **Consistency checks:** Cross-validate retrieved data with other sources to ensure consistency.\n\n4.  **Debugging and Logging Enhancement:** Implement extensive logging of the information retrieval and validation process. This should include:\n    *   The original question\n    *   The search queries used\n    *   The retrieved data\n    *   The validation checks performed\n    *   The outcome of each validation check\n    *   Any errors or exceptions encountered\n\n5.  **Address Numeric Data Handling Specifically:** Focus attention on sample IDs 1 and 2 as they contain numeric output. Examine the numerical data structure used to represent expected and received answers, and comparisons in validation checks.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is **Stable (but critically low)**. The system consistently fails, indicating a lack of progress. The implementation of the above actionable recommendations will be critical to initiating a positive trend.\n"

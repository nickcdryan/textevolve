This strategy aims to address the challenges of incorrect pattern deduction and limited generalization by focusing on robust pattern identification and validation before applying the transformation to the test input.\n\nThis approach differs significantly from previous ones by:\n\n1.  Iterative Refinement of Transformation Patterns: Focuses on improving the accuracy of identified transformation patterns through iterative refinement and verification, rather than relying on a single extraction step.\n2.  Dynamic Selection of Relevant Training Examples: Selects relevant training examples based on similarity to the test input, enabling the system to focus on the most relevant information for the transformation.\n3.  Verification of Transformation Patterns: Verifies transformation patterns by applying them to training examples and comparing the results with the expected outputs.\n4.  Multi-Agent Orchestration: Uses multiple LLM agents with specialized roles, including a pattern identifier, a pattern verifier, and a transformation applier.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union\n\ndef call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):\n    \"\"\"Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        from google import genai\n        from google.genai import types\n\n        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"))\n\n        if system_instruction:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n                    system_instruction=system_instruction\n                ),\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n        else:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n\n        return response.text\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}\")\n        return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n\ndef extract_training_and_test_data(question: str) -> Dict:\n    \"\"\"Extracts training examples and test input from the question.\"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are an expert at extracting structured data.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-agent approach to solve grid transformation problems by iteratively identifying and verifying transformation patterns. It decomposes the problem into extracting data, selecting relevant examples, identifying a transformation pattern, verifying the pattern, and applying it to the test input. The agents include a data extractor, example selector, pattern identifier, pattern verifier, and transformation applier, all implemented using the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini LLM. The `main` function orchestrates this workflow, calling functions such as `extract_training_and_test_data`, `select_relevant_examples`, `identify_transformation_pattern`, `verify_transformation_pattern`, and `apply_transformation` in sequence to arrive at the final transformed grid.",

    "capability_report": {
      "text_report": "Here's a comprehensive capability report based on the performance summary, error analysis, and execution outputs provided:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates limited capability in solving grid transformation problems. With an accuracy of 0.00 (0/3), the system struggles significantly with pattern recognition, transformation logic, and computational efficiency. While it attempts to follow patterns and generate outputs in the correct format, it frequently fails to apply the transformation rules accurately and times out on at least one sample. The system needs substantial improvements across several areas to become reliable.\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Timeout Error:** Sample 0 resulted in a timeout, indicating significant performance issues. The AI likely got stuck in a computation loop or the algorithm is inherently too slow.\n*   **Incorrect Transformations:** Samples 1 and 2 produced incorrect output grids. The provided output shows that the system attempts to change numbers within the grid, but the transformations are not consistent with expected patterns. The system seems to be identifying numbers to change (e.g., '6' and '1' becoming other numbers) but fails to place them in the correct locations based on training examples. There is evidence of both under-generalization (not applying a pattern when it should) and over-generalization (applying a pattern when it shouldn't).\n*   **Format Adherence:** The system correctly formats the output as a grid (nested list of lists) with the correct data type (integers), indicating that the information extraction and output formatting aspects are likely functional.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:**  The system can generate output in the required grid format.\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Basic):** The system attempts to follow patterns observed in training data (although incorrectly).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:**  The system struggles to accurately recognize and generalize transformation patterns from training data to unseen test inputs. This is the most significant weakness.\n*   **Transformation Logic:**  The system's logic for applying transformations is flawed and leads to incorrect number placement.\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** The system's implementation is inefficient, leading to timeouts for more complex grids.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system cannot verify if its output is correct, meaning there is no self-checking.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**.  Without the ability to accurately understand and extrapolate patterns, the system cannot perform grid transformations correctly.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust Pattern Recognition Module:**\n    *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are designed for spatial data and can effectively identify patterns in grids. Use a CNN to learn the transformations directly from the input-output grid pairs.\n    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** If the relationships between numbers in the grid are important, GNNs can model these relationships and learn transformations based on the graph structure.\n    *   **Feature Engineering with Spatial Information:**  Before applying any learning algorithm, extract features that capture spatial relationships. Examples include:\n        *   Proximity to other numbers of the same value.\n        *   Relative positions of numbers (e.g., \"number 'A' is always above number 'B'\").\n        *   Symmetry or repetition of patterns.\n2.  **Refine Transformation Logic with Rule-Based or ML Approaches:**\n    *   **Rule-Based System:** After recognizing a pattern, apply pre-defined rules to transform the grid. These rules can be manually crafted based on the problem domain or learned from examples.\n    *   **Machine Learning Model for Transformation Application:** Train a separate ML model to apply the correct transformations based on the recognized pattern. The pattern recognition module would feed the transformation model with the recognized pattern.\n3.  **Optimize Algorithm Efficiency and Add Debugging:**\n    *   **Profiling:** Use a profiler to identify performance bottlenecks in the code (e.g., using `cProfile` in Python).\n    *   **Efficient Data Structures:**  Ensure you're using appropriate data structures. For instance, if searching within the grid is common, use efficient data structures like dictionaries or sets for lookups.\n    *   **Algorithm Optimization:**  Review the transformation logic and look for areas of algorithmic inefficiency.  Avoid unnecessary computations.\n    *   **Intermediate Debugging Statements:** Add print statements *throughout* the transformation logic.  Specifically, print the state of the grid at various key steps (e.g., after identifying a pattern, before applying a transformation, after applying a transformation).  This will provide visibility into the transformation process and allow you to pinpoint where the logic deviates from the expected behavior.\n4.  **Data Augmentation:**\n    *   Increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations (rotations, reflections, small perturbations) to existing training examples. This will improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen inputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0/3 accuracy), the capability trend is **Declining**. The system needs immediate attention to reverse this trend. The identified weaknesses must be addressed with significant algorithmic and implementation improvements.\n",

This will allow for a clearer understanding of why things go wrong and where the code is failing.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **sample\\_id: 0**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Likely succeeded (understanding the grid format)\n    *   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (timed out)\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: N/A\n*   **sample\\_id: 1**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Likely succeeded\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Likely succeeded\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect number placement)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (incorrect output)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed (incorrect output)\n*   **sample\\_id: 2**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Likely succeeded\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Likely succeeded\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect number placement)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (incorrect output)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed (incorrect output)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Here's a comprehensive capability report based on the performance summary, error analysis, and execution outputs provided:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates limited capability in solving grid transformation problems. With an accuracy of 0.00 (0/3), the system struggles significantly with pattern recognition, transformation logic, and computational efficiency. While it attempts to follow patterns and generate outputs in the correct format, it frequently fails to apply the transformation rules accurately and times out on at least one sample. The system needs substantial improvements across several areas to become reliable.\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Timeout Error:** Sample 0 resulted in a timeout, indicating significant performance issues. The AI likely got stuck in a computation loop or the algorithm is inherently too slow.\n*   **Incorrect Transformations:** Samples 1 and 2 produced incorrect output grids. The provided output shows that the system attempts to change numbers within the grid, but the transformations are not consistent with expected patterns. The system seems to be identifying numbers to change (e.g., '6' and '1' becoming other numbers) but fails to place them in the correct locations based on training examples. There is evidence of both under-generalization (not applying a pattern when it should) and over-generalization (applying a pattern when it shouldn't).\n*   **Format Adherence:** The system correctly formats the output as a grid (nested list of lists) with the correct data type (integers), indicating that the information extraction and output formatting aspects are likely functional.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:**  The system can generate output in the required grid format.\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Basic):** The system attempts to follow patterns observed in training data (although incorrectly).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:**  The system struggles to accurately recognize and generalize transformation patterns from training data to unseen test inputs. This is the most significant weakness.\n*   **Transformation Logic:**  The system's logic for applying transformations is flawed and leads to incorrect number placement.\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** The system's implementation is inefficient, leading to timeouts for more complex grids.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system cannot verify if its output is correct, meaning there is no self-checking.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**.  Without the ability to accurately understand and extrapolate patterns, the system cannot perform grid transformations correctly.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust Pattern Recognition Module:**\n    *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are designed for spatial data and can effectively identify patterns in grids. Use a CNN to learn the transformations directly from the input-output grid pairs.\n    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** If the relationships between numbers in the grid are important, GNNs can model these relationships and learn transformations based on the graph structure.\n    *   **Feature Engineering with Spatial Information:**  Before applying any learning algorithm, extract features that capture spatial relationships. Examples include:\n        *   Proximity to other numbers of the same value.\n        *   Relative positions of numbers (e.g., \"number 'A' is always above number 'B'\").\n        *   Symmetry or repetition of patterns.\n2.  **Refine Transformation Logic with Rule-Based or ML Approaches:**\n    *   **Rule-Based System:** After recognizing a pattern, apply pre-defined rules to transform the grid. These rules can be manually crafted based on the problem domain or learned from examples.\n    *   **Machine Learning Model for Transformation Application:** Train a separate ML model to apply the correct transformations based on the recognized pattern. The pattern recognition module would feed the transformation model with the recognized pattern.\n3.  **Optimize Algorithm Efficiency and Add Debugging:**\n    *   **Profiling:** Use a profiler to identify performance bottlenecks in the code (e.g., using `cProfile` in Python).\n    *   **Efficient Data Structures:**  Ensure you're using appropriate data structures. For instance, if searching within the grid is common, use efficient data structures like dictionaries or sets for lookups.\n    *   **Algorithm Optimization:**  Review the transformation logic and look for areas of algorithmic inefficiency.  Avoid unnecessary computations.\n    *   **Intermediate Debugging Statements:** Add print statements *throughout* the transformation logic.  Specifically, print the state of the grid at various key steps (e.g., after identifying a pattern, before applying a transformation, after applying a transformation).  This will provide visibility into the transformation process and allow you to pinpoint where the logic deviates from the expected behavior.\n4.  **Data Augmentation:**\n    *   Increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations (rotations, reflections, small perturbations) to existing training examples. This will improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen inputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0/3 accuracy), the capability trend is **Declining**. The system needs immediate attention to reverse this trend. The identified weaknesses must be addressed with significant algorithmic and implementation improvements.\n"

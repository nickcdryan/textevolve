  "approach_summary": "This script uses LLM-driven techniques to solve grid transformation problems by decomposing the transformation into steps and predicting cell values. It employs chain-of-thought reasoning, where the LLM first decomposes the grid transformation into a series of steps and then predicts the value of a specific cell based on this decomposition. The agent's role is that of an expert in identifying grid transformation patterns. The `solve_grid_transformation` function decomposes the problem, and predicts values using the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini API, then constructs the transformed grid. The `main` function initiates the process by calling `solve_grid_transformation` on a given question.",

This rule seems context-dependent and requires checking neighboring cell values.\n2.  **Rule 2: Consecutive Ones Rule:** If there are consecutive ones in a row, the '8' values above and below those ones in columns 6 and 11 become '6'.\n3.  **Rule 3: 3x3 Region Rule:** Values of '8' within a 3x3 region with a '1' in the 4th and 11th column are changed to '6' if the row number is 5 and 12, and their column is not the 7th or 10th.\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n```\n\n**Predicting Value at (0, 0):**\n\n1. **Initial Value:** The value at (0, 0) in the input grid is 8.\n\n2. **Rule 1 Check:**  We need to consider the neighbors of (0, 0). Since (0,0) is on the corner, we don't have enough information about what the condition looks like for the neighborhood.\n\n3. **Rule 2 Check:**  This rule applies to columns 6 and 11 where we look at consecutive ones. Location (0, 0) is not in column 6 or 11, so this rule doesn't apply.\n\n4. **Rule 3 Check:** This rule focuses on row 5 and 12, and column 4 and 11 in relation to the 3x3 neighborhood. Since (0, 0) is not in rows 5 or 12 and does not contain a value of '1' in column 4 or 11 of a 3x3 region, this rule doesn't apply.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since none of the rules appear to change the value at (0, 0), it remains its original value.\n\n**Predicted Value: 8**\n\nANSWER_START\n[[0]]\nANSWER_END\n",

We need to check if any of the 5s in the input grid will cause the value at (0, 0) to change to 1.\n2.  The 5s are located at: (1, 1), (2, 8), (4, 3), (7, 1), (7, 5).\n3.  For the cell at (0,0) to become a 1, one of the 5's needs to be a neighbor (up, down, left, right, or diagonal).\n4. Consider each 5. The 5 at (1,1) is a diagonal neighbor. Since (1,1) is diagonally adjacent to (0,0), the 5 will change the value at (0,0).\n5.  Consider the 5 at (2,8). The location (0,0) is not a neighbor, so this 5 does not affect the location (0,0).\n6.  Consider the 5 at (4,3). The location (0,0) is not a neighbor, so this 5 does not affect the location (0,0).\n7.  Consider the 5 at (7,1). The location (0,0) is not a neighbor, so this 5 does not affect the location (0,0).\n8.  Consider the 5 at (7,5). The location (0,0) is not a neighbor, so this 5 does not affect the location (0,0).\n9.  Since the location (0,0) is diagonally next to a 5 located at (1,1), the cell becomes 1.\n\n**Predicted Value:** 1\n\nANSWER_START\n[[0]]\nANSWER_END\n",

Specifically, the pattern seems to focus on the corners and the center.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of the transformation, inferred from the training examples:\n\n*   **Output Grid Dimensions:** The output grid seems to be approximately 1/3 the size of the input grid along each dimension, but with a transformation that seems to depend on key \"features\" or clusters within the original grid.\n*   **Corner Values:** The corners of the output grid often reflect values found near the corners of the input grid.\n*   **Center Value:** The center of the output grid seems to be

This rule seems context-dependent and requires checking neighboring cell values.\n2.  **Rule 2: Consecutive Ones Rule:** If there are consecutive ones in a row, the '8' values above and below those ones in columns 6 and 11 become '6'.\n3.  **Rule 3: 3x3 Region Rule:** Values of '8' within a 3x3 region with a '1' in the 4th and 11th column are changed to '6' if the row number is 5 and 12, and their column is not the 7th or 10th.\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n```\n\n**Predicting Value at (0, 0):**\n\n1. **Initial Value:** The value at (0, 0) in the input grid is 8.\n\n2. **Rule 1 Check:**  We need to consider the neighbors of (0, 0). Since (0,0) is on the corner, we don't have enough information about what the condition looks like for the neighborhood.\n\n3. **Rule 2 Check:**  This rule applies to columns 6 and 11 where we look at consecutive ones. Location (0, 0) is not in column 6 or 11, so this rule doesn't apply.\n\n4. **Rule 3 Check:** This rule focuses on row 5 and 12, and column 4 and 11 in relation to the 3x3 neighborhood. Since (0, 0) is not in rows 5 or 12 and does not contain a value of '1' in column 4 or 11 of a 3x3 region, this rule doesn't apply.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since none of the rules appear to change the value at (0, 0), it remains its original value.\n\n**Predicted Value: 8**\n\nANSWER_START\n[[0]]\nANSWER_END\n",

This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the output format and the task itself.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Decomposition of Transformations:** The system attempts to break down the grid transformation into smaller, more manageable steps.\n2.  **Reasoning about Cell Values:** The system tries to reason about how individual cell values change based on their neighbors and the overall grid pattern.\n3.  **Extraction of Rules:** It tries to extract general rules from the given examples, such as \"If there are consecutive ones, the '8' above and below those ones in columns 6 and column 11 becomes a '6'.\"\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Incorrect Output Format:** The system consistently produces an output in the wrong format (single-element list instead of a 2D grid). This is a fundamental flaw.\n2.  **Misunderstanding of Task:** The system's reasoning, while present, doesn't translate into generating the correct transformed grid. It seems to get lost in local reasoning and fails to construct the overall output grid.\n3.  **Difficulty Applying Rules:** Even when the system extracts a plausible rule, it struggles to apply that rule across the entire grid to generate the correct output.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Output Generation Logic:** The primary bottleneck is the logic responsible for constructing the output grid. This logic seems fundamentally flawed, leading to the incorrect format and values. It is not producing the expected 2D array but a single value which is almost always `0`.\n2.  **Global Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to identify and apply global patterns across the entire grid. It focuses too much on local rules and fails to integrate them to create the correct transformed grid.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is the system producing `[[0]]` as the answer, regardless of the input or extracted rules. This strongly suggests a problem in the final stage of the process, where the output grid is assembled. The \"Predicted Value\" section in the output shows more meaningful reasoning, but this is lost in the final output.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **incorrect output generation**. The system's logic for creating and populating the final output grid is severely flawed, resulting in an output with the wrong format and incorrect values. It outputs `[[0]]` regardless of the input grid and the extracted rules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Output Generation:** This needs a complete overhaul. The system needs to generate a 2D array representing the transformed grid. The logic to populate this grid based on the extracted rules needs to be significantly improved.\n2.  **Global Pattern Integration:** The system needs to be better at identifying and applying global patterns, rather than focusing solely on local rules. The current approach makes very localized decisions which cannot be combined into a full grid.\n3.  **Rule Application:** Improve the system's ability to consistently and accurately apply the extracted rules across the entire grid. This might involve using a more systematic and structured approach.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Re-implement Output Generation:** Completely rewrite the output generation logic to create a 2D array of the correct dimensions. Use the input grid dimensions as a starting point and ensure that the output is also a 2D array with the correct number of rows and columns.\n2.  **Introduce Grid-Level Operations:** Implement functions that operate on the entire grid at once, rather than just individual cells. For example, a function that finds all occurrences of a specific pattern and applies a transformation to their neighbors.\n3.  **Develop a Structured Rule Application Process:** Design a more structured and systematic process for applying the extracted rules. This might involve prioritizing rules, applying them in a specific order, or using a more formal rule-based system.\n4. Add print statements and intermediate output during the grid construction phase to better understand what values the AI is assigning and what their rationale is.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   solution_generation: FAILED (Incorrect output format and values)\n    *   solution_verification: FAILED (The system doesn't verify against the training examples, because otherwise it would realize the output is wrong)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   solution_generation: FAILED (Incorrect output format and values)\n    *   solution_verification: FAILED\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   solution_generation: FAILED (Incorrect output format and values)\n    *   solution_verification: FAILED\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and your prompt.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a critical and consistent failure: despite the system attempting to decompose the problem and reason about the transformations, the final answer is *always* `[[0]]`.  This occurs even when the \"Predicted Value\" section contains reasonable deductions and even correct answers (e.g., predicting '8' or '1' for a specific cell). This confirms the *Output Generation Logic* as the primary bottleneck.  The reasoning about individual cell values and rule extraction is effectively disconnected from the final output construction. The generated grid using the rules is not being properly incorporated into the agent answer and is instead overwritten by `[[0]]`.\n\nThe outputs also suggest that the system is attempting to perform *some* form of reasoning, even if it's ultimately unsuccessful.  It identifies potential rules and attempts to apply them. However, the translation of these rules into concrete grid transformations is non-existent. In some cases, the intermediate grid that the system proposes seems reasonable, so the core grid transformation logic seems to be working. However, it does not get propagated out through the agent answer.\n\nIn the last execution output, the AI system attempts to generate a grid in the `transform_grid` function. However, the agent still returned `[[0]]`. This means that the `transform_grid` function may not be properly implemented as the agent answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates rudimentary capabilities in **decomposition and local reasoning about grid transformations**. However, it **fails completely in solution generation** due to a critical flaw in the output generation logic. The system has some ability to perform intermediate grid transformation operations, but these intermediate transformations are not properly propagated out through the final answer. It also does not have a way to run the final grid through the training examples as a basic sanity check.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Decomposition of Transformations:** Breaking down the problem into smaller steps is a valuable approach.\n*   **Reasoning about Cell Values:** Attempting to understand how cell values change is a good starting point.\n*   **Rule Extraction:** The system tries to identify patterns and formulate rules, which is essential for generalization.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Output Format:** The system consistently produces the wrong output format, indicating a misunderstanding of the task requirements.\n*   **Output Generation Logic:** The logic for constructing the output grid is severely flawed, resulting in `[[0]]` regardless of input.\n*   **Rule Application:** The system struggles to translate extracted rules into accurate grid transformations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Output Generation**.  The system needs to reliably generate a 2D array representing the transformed grid based on its extracted rules and reasoning. The intermediate transformations must be properly propagated to the agent answer.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Re-implement Output Generation & Integrate Intermediate Transformations:**\n    *   **Action:** Completely rewrite the output generation logic. Ensure that the system creates a 2D array with the correct dimensions (matching the expected output format). The intermediate grid generation functions should be properly incorporated into the agent answer.\n    *   **Details:** Use the input grid dimensions to initialize the output grid. After extracting and applying rules, populate the output grid *cell by cell* based on the transformations.\n\n2.  **Introduce Sanity Check:**\n    *   **Action:** Develop a simple verification mechanism that checks the final output against the training examples.\n    *   **Details:** Before outputting the answer, compare the predicted grid with the provided training output. Calculate a similarity score (e.g., percentage of matching cells). If the score is below a threshold, trigger a re-evaluation of the transformation rules or output generation. If the output does not match, then at least the agent is aware that the result is inaccurate.\n\n3.  **Add Print Statements:**\n    *   **Action:** Add extensive logging during the grid construction phase.\n    *   **Details:** Print the values being assigned to each cell, the rules that are being applied, and the intermediate states of the grid. This will make debugging much easier.\n\n4.  **Unit Tests for Grid Transformation Logic:**\n    *   **Action:** Create isolated unit tests for the grid transformation logic.\n    *   **Details:** Write tests to verify that individual transformations (e.g., applying a specific rule) produce the expected output on small, controlled grids.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the system's capabilities are **stable at a very low level** (near zero). The consistent failure to produce the correct output format indicates a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed before any meaningful progress can be made.  However, the *attempt* at reasoning and rule extraction suggests that the core architecture has potential for improvement once the output generation bottleneck is resolved.\n",

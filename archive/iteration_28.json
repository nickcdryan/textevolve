  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions, incorporating techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning and result verification. The problem is decomposed into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The script employs different agent roles through system instructions.\n\nThe `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `analyze_question` to understand the question, `extract_relevant_passage` to find supporting text, `generate_answer` to create an initial answer, and `verify_answer` to validate the response. Each of these functions uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini LLM, passing a prompt and system instruction. The overall workflow involves sequentially refining the answer through these stages, leveraging the LLM at each step with focused prompts and system instructions to emulate specialized agents.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: In November 1944, after Greece was liberated from Germany, old drachmae were exchanged for new ones at the rate of 50,000,000,000 to 1. Only paper money was issued. The government issued notes of 1, 5, 10 and 20 drachmae, with the Bank of Greece issuing 50-, 100-, 500-, 1000-, 5000-, and 10,000-drachma notes. This drachma also suffered from high inflation. The government later issued 100-, 500-, and 1000-drachma notes, and the Bank of Greece issued 20,000-and 50,000-drachma notes. Third modern drachma coins The first issue of coins minted in 1954 consisted of holed aluminium 5-, 10- and 20-lepton pieces, with 50-lepton, 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-drachma pieces in cupro-nickel. A silver 20-drachma piece was issued in 1960, replacing the 20-drachma banknote, and also minted only in collector sets in 1965.  Coins in denominations from 50 lepta to 20 drachmae carried a portrait of Paul of Greece (1947\u20131964). New coins were introduced in 1966, ranging from 50 lepta to 10 drachmae, depicting Constantine II of Greece (1964\u20131974). A silver 30 drachma coin for the centennial of Greeces royal dynasty was minted in 1963.  The following year a non-circulating coin of this value was produced to commemorate the royal wedding.  The reverse of all coins was altered in 1971 to reflect the military junta which was in power from 1967 to 1974. This design included a soldier standing in front of the flames of the rising phoenix.\n\nQUESTION: How many years after the first issue of coins was the silver 20-drachma piece issued?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Bills' WR Lee Evans and QB J. P. Losman were unstoppable in the first quarter, connecting for 205 yards and two 83-yard touchdowns. Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score. The 83-yard TDs were career highs for both Losman and Evans and marked the first time in franchise history the Bills have had two 80-yard passes in a single game. David Carr opened 1 for 3 with an interception on his first pass before completing his next 22 throws. Carr finished 25 of 30 for 223 yards and no touchdowns. Carr tied the record held by Mark Brunell, who had 22 consecutive completions in Washington's 31-15 win over the Texans at Reliant Stadium on September 24. He tied Brunell's record on a short pass to Wali Lundy for no gain with 6:19 left. The streak was broken when his pass to Andre Johnson with 5:44 remaining fell short. Lundy cut the lead to 14-7 with a 17-yard run in the first quarter. That score was set up by a 17-yard reception by Eric Moulds on third-and-8. Samkon Gado made it 17-14 on a 1-yard run in the second quarter. Moulds also had a key third-down reception on that drive. Dunta Robinson gave the Texans the lead on a 9-yard interception return midway through the third quarter. Losman was throwing out of the end zone when Robinson intercepted the pass intended for Evans to score his first career touchdown and the Texans' first defensive touchdown since 2004. But after the offense failed to put the game away in the fourth quarter the Texans gave the Bills just enough time to beat them. Losman hit a diving Peerless Price in the back of the end zone for the 15-yard touchdown with 13 seconds left, giving Buffalo the 24-21 win.\n\nQUESTION: What was the final score of the game?",

      "original_passage": "In November 1944, after Greece was liberated from Germany, old drachmae were exchanged for new ones at the rate of 50,000,000,000 to 1. Only paper money was issued. The government issued notes of 1, 5, 10 and 20 drachmae, with the Bank of Greece issuing 50-, 100-, 500-, 1000-, 5000-, and 10,000-drachma notes. This drachma also suffered from high inflation. The government later issued 100-, 500-, and 1000-drachma notes, and the Bank of Greece issued 20,000-and 50,000-drachma notes. Third modern drachma coins The first issue of coins minted in 1954 consisted of holed aluminium 5-, 10- and 20-lepton pieces, with 50-lepton, 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-drachma pieces in cupro-nickel. A silver 20-drachma piece was issued in 1960, replacing the 20-drachma banknote, and also minted only in collector sets in 1965.  Coins in denominations from 50 lepta to 20 drachmae carried a portrait of Paul of Greece (1947\u20131964). New coins were introduced in 1966, ranging from 50 lepta to 10 drachmae, depicting Constantine II of Greece (1964\u20131974). A silver 30 drachma coin for the centennial of Greeces royal dynasty was minted in 1963.  The following year a non-circulating coin of this value was produced to commemorate the royal wedding.  The reverse of all coins was altered in 1971 to reflect the military junta which was in power from 1967 to 1974. This design included a soldier standing in front of the flames of the rising phoenix.",

      "original_passage": "The Bills' WR Lee Evans and QB J. P. Losman were unstoppable in the first quarter, connecting for 205 yards and two 83-yard touchdowns. Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score. The 83-yard TDs were career highs for both Losman and Evans and marked the first time in franchise history the Bills have had two 80-yard passes in a single game. David Carr opened 1 for 3 with an interception on his first pass before completing his next 22 throws. Carr finished 25 of 30 for 223 yards and no touchdowns. Carr tied the record held by Mark Brunell, who had 22 consecutive completions in Washington's 31-15 win over the Texans at Reliant Stadium on September 24. He tied Brunell's record on a short pass to Wali Lundy for no gain with 6:19 left. The streak was broken when his pass to Andre Johnson with 5:44 remaining fell short. Lundy cut the lead to 14-7 with a 17-yard run in the first quarter. That score was set up by a 17-yard reception by Eric Moulds on third-and-8. Samkon Gado made it 17-14 on a 1-yard run in the second quarter. Moulds also had a key third-down reception on that drive. Dunta Robinson gave the Texans the lead on a 9-yard interception return midway through the third quarter. Losman was throwing out of the end zone when Robinson intercepted the pass intended for Evans to score his first career touchdown and the Texans' first defensive touchdown since 2004. But after the offense failed to put the game away in the fourth quarter the Texans gave the Bills just enough time to beat them. Losman hit a diving Peerless Price in the back of the end zone for the 15-yard touchdown with 13 seconds left, giving Buffalo the 24-21 win.",

Since there are no error cases, I will focus on extracting patterns from successful runs and suggest improvements based on those observations.\n\n## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no runtime errors in the provided data since all cases are successful.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Accurate Information Extraction:** The system consistently extracts relevant information from the passage, even when the passage contains numerical data, dates, and specific player names in sports contexts. This is evident in examples such as determining the correct years for subtraction (sample_id 0) or identifying players and their scoring plays (sample_id 2 and 4).\n\n2.  **Logical Reasoning and Calculation:** The system demonstrates the ability to perform basic arithmetic operations (subtraction in sample_id 0), compare numerical values (sample_id 4), and draw logical conclusions based on extracted information (sample_id 2).\n\n3.  **Direct Answer Retrieval:** When the answer is explicitly stated in the passage, the system correctly identifies and extracts it (sample_id 1 and 3).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Lack of Error Cases:** Without error cases, it's impossible to fully assess potential weaknesses or failure points of the system. We can only infer potential weaknesses based on the type of questions the system answers correctly. More complex reasoning or inference may pose a challenge.\n\n2.  **Limited Complexity of Reasoning:** The successful cases mostly involve direct information retrieval and simple calculations. The system's performance on more complex questions requiring multiple steps of reasoning or inference is unknown.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Dependence on Explicit Information:** The system seems to excel at answering questions based on explicitly stated information. A critical bottleneck could be its ability to handle questions requiring deeper inference, synthesis of information from different parts of the passage, or understanding nuanced language.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nSince there are no error cases, there are no error patterns to identify.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **lack of error case data**, which prevents a thorough analysis and identification of specific weaknesses. Without error cases, it's challenging to pinpoint areas where the system needs improvement.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Complex Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to handle questions that require complex reasoning, inference, and synthesis of information.\n2.  **Ambiguity Resolution:** Enhance the system's capability to deal with ambiguous questions or passages and to clarify the question before proceeding.\n3.  **Counterfactual Reasoning:** Add the ability to deal with counterfactual questions\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce a Dataset of Challenging Questions:** Create a dataset of questions that require more complex reasoning, inference, and synthesis of information, specifically designed to expose potential weaknesses in the current system. This dataset should include ambiguous questions, and questions that require combining information from multiple places in the passage.\n2.  **Implement Reasoning Traces:** Add detailed reasoning traces (e.g., using print statements or logging) to track the system's decision-making process at each step. This will make it easier to identify where the reasoning goes wrong when the system fails.\n3.  **Develop a More Robust Inference Engine:** Investigate and implement more sophisticated inference techniques, such as rule-based reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, or neural network-based inference models.\n4.   **Implement an \"I don't know\" Feature:** The system should confidently and gracefully say \"I don't know\" when it cannot answer a question, rather than confidently providing incorrect answers.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nSince there are no error cases, there are no capability failures to map.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, I've reviewed the provided information and generated a comprehensive capability report for your AI system.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs show generally good performance. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Sample 1:** The system correctly performs subtraction to calculate the difference between two years. The inclusion of \"Verification: 6 years\" suggests a self-checking mechanism, which is excellent.\n*   **Sample 2:** A direct answer retrieval, indicating the system can find and extract information accurately.\n*   **Sample 3:** The system demonstrates a more complex understanding of the passage. It correctly identifies that LaDainian Tomlinson's TD run was shorter than other scoring plays mentioned and accurately confirms its initial assessment. The \"Verification: LaDainian Tomlinson\" shows the system pinpointing its final answer.\n\n*Lack of information:* No errors, only successful execution traces. This makes a proper analysis of the system's weaknesses difficult.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nBased on the limited successful sample execution outputs, the system demonstrates:\n\n*   **Strong Arithmetic Skills:** Can perform basic calculations accurately.\n*   **Direct Information Extraction:** Can reliably find and extract specific information when explicitly stated in the passage.\n*   **Limited Logical Reasoning:** Shows some ability to compare values and draw basic conclusions.\n*   **Self-Verification:** Appears to have a self-verification mechanism, which is a valuable feature.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember this assessment is based on a very small and exclusively successful dataset.  The true capabilities of the system are difficult to assess without error cases. It is unknown how the system handles more complex scenarios or questions.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The system achieves 100% accuracy on the provided examples.\n*   **Arithmetic Ability:** Correctly executes simple calculations.\n*   **Direct Information Retrieval:** Excellently extracts factual answers from the input.\n*   **Self-Verification:** The presence of a verification step in the output shows that the system attempts to validate its answer, a powerful technique.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Error Data:** The most significant weakness is the complete absence of error cases. This prevents a thorough analysis of failure modes.\n*   **Limited Reasoning Depth:** The successful examples suggest the system might struggle with questions requiring deeper reasoning, multi-step inference, or synthesis of information.\n*   **Unknown Handling of Ambiguity:** Without error cases, it's impossible to assess how the system handles ambiguous questions, contradictory information, or nuanced language.\n*   **Potential Overconfidence:** A lack of \"I don't know\" responses *could* indicate that the system might provide confident, but incorrect, answers in scenarios it cannot handle.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is the system's ability to handle **complex reasoning and inference**. This is crucial for moving beyond simple question answering and achieving a more robust and capable AI system. This needs to be done via the introduction of a more complicated and varied test data set to identify failures, and iterate on.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Develop a Challenging Test Suite:** Create a diverse dataset of questions that require:\n    *   **Multi-step reasoning:** Questions requiring combining information from different parts of the passage.\n    *   **Inference:** Questions where the answer is not explicitly stated but must be inferred.\n    *   **Ambiguity resolution:** Questions designed to test the system's ability to handle unclear or conflicting information.\n    *   **Numerical Reasoning:** Questions with calculations of varying complexity.\n    *   **Counterfactual questions**: \"What if...\" scenarios to test the system's understanding of the context.\n2.  **Implement Detailed Logging:** Enhance the system to log its reasoning process step-by-step. This should include:\n    *   The specific parts of the passage being considered.\n    *   The intermediate calculations or inferences being made.\n    *   The confidence level associated with each step.\n    *   Log timestamps, memory usage, and other performance metrics for optimization.\n3.  **Introduce Uncertainty Handling:** Integrate a mechanism for the system to express uncertainty and answer, \"I don't know,\" when it cannot confidently determine the answer.  This is crucial for avoiding incorrect responses and building trust in the system. Base the confidence level on a combination of the information retrieval accuracy and the complexity of the reasoning required.\n4.  **Investigate alternative modeling approaches.** Since the model currently can only answer simple questions, consider switching to a more advanced model capable of common-sense reasoning, such as Google's PaLM or OpenAI's GPT-4.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, it's impossible to accurately assess the capability trend. The system performs well on simple tasks, but its ability to handle more complex scenarios is unknown. To determine the capability trend, you *must* implement the actionable recommendations, particularly the creation of a challenging test suite and detailed logging, so that the performance of your AI can be comprehensively evaluated in future iterations.\n",

This is evident in examples such as determining the correct years for subtraction (sample_id 0) or identifying players and their scoring plays (sample_id 2 and 4).\n\n2.  **Logical Reasoning and Calculation:** The system demonstrates the ability to perform basic arithmetic operations (subtraction in sample_id 0), compare numerical values (sample_id 4), and draw logical conclusions based on extracted information (sample_id 2).\n\n3.  **Direct Answer Retrieval:** When the answer is explicitly stated in the passage, the system correctly identifies and extracts it (sample_id 1 and 3).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Lack of Error Cases:** Without error cases, it's impossible to fully assess potential weaknesses or failure points of the system. We can only infer potential weaknesses based on the type of questions the system answers correctly. More complex reasoning or inference may pose a challenge.\n\n2.  **Limited Complexity of Reasoning:** The successful cases mostly involve direct information retrieval and simple calculations. The system's performance on more complex questions requiring multiple steps of reasoning or inference is unknown.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Dependence on Explicit Information:** The system seems to excel at answering questions based on explicitly stated information. A critical bottleneck could be its ability to handle questions requiring deeper inference, synthesis of information from different parts of the passage, or understanding nuanced language.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nSince there are no error cases, there are no error patterns to identify.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **lack of error case data**, which prevents a thorough analysis and identification of specific weaknesses. Without error cases, it's challenging to pinpoint areas where the system needs improvement.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Complex Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to handle questions that require complex reasoning, inference, and synthesis of information.\n2.  **Ambiguity Resolution:** Enhance the system's capability to deal with ambiguous questions or passages and to clarify the question before proceeding.\n3.  **Counterfactual Reasoning:** Add the ability to deal with counterfactual questions\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce a Dataset of Challenging Questions:** Create a dataset of questions that require more complex reasoning, inference, and synthesis of information, specifically designed to expose potential weaknesses in the current system. This dataset should include ambiguous questions, and questions that require combining information from multiple places in the passage.\n2.  **Implement Reasoning Traces:** Add detailed reasoning traces (e.g., using print statements or logging) to track the system's decision-making process at each step. This will make it easier to identify where the reasoning goes wrong when the system fails.\n3.  **Develop a More Robust Inference Engine:** Investigate and implement more sophisticated inference techniques, such as rule-based reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, or neural network-based inference models.\n4.   **Implement an \"I don't know\" Feature:** The system should confidently and gracefully say \"I don't know\" when it cannot answer a question, rather than confidently providing incorrect answers.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nSince there are no error cases, there are no capability failures to map.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, I've reviewed the provided information and generated a comprehensive capability report for your AI system.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs show generally good performance. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Sample 1:** The system correctly performs subtraction to calculate the difference between two years. The inclusion of \"Verification: 6 years\" suggests a self-checking mechanism, which is excellent.\n*   **Sample 2:** A direct answer retrieval, indicating the system can find and extract information accurately.\n*   **Sample 3:** The system demonstrates a more complex understanding of the passage. It correctly identifies that LaDainian Tomlinson's TD run was shorter than other scoring plays mentioned and accurately confirms its initial assessment. The \"Verification: LaDainian Tomlinson\" shows the system pinpointing its final answer.\n\n*Lack of information:* No errors, only successful execution traces. This makes a proper analysis of the system's weaknesses difficult.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nBased on the limited successful sample execution outputs, the system demonstrates:\n\n*   **Strong Arithmetic Skills:** Can perform basic calculations accurately.\n*   **Direct Information Extraction:** Can reliably find and extract specific information when explicitly stated in the passage.\n*   **Limited Logical Reasoning:** Shows some ability to compare values and draw basic conclusions.\n*   **Self-Verification:** Appears to have a self-verification mechanism, which is a valuable feature.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember this assessment is based on a very small and exclusively successful dataset.  The true capabilities of the system are difficult to assess without error cases. It is unknown how the system handles more complex scenarios or questions.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The system achieves 100% accuracy on the provided examples.\n*   **Arithmetic Ability:** Correctly executes simple calculations.\n*   **Direct Information Retrieval:** Excellently extracts factual answers from the input.\n*   **Self-Verification:** The presence of a verification step in the output shows that the system attempts to validate its answer, a powerful technique.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Error Data:** The most significant weakness is the complete absence of error cases. This prevents a thorough analysis of failure modes.\n*   **Limited Reasoning Depth:** The successful examples suggest the system might struggle with questions requiring deeper reasoning, multi-step inference, or synthesis of information.\n*   **Unknown Handling of Ambiguity:** Without error cases, it's impossible to assess how the system handles ambiguous questions, contradictory information, or nuanced language.\n*   **Potential Overconfidence:** A lack of \"I don't know\" responses *could* indicate that the system might provide confident, but incorrect, answers in scenarios it cannot handle.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is the system's ability to handle **complex reasoning and inference**. This is crucial for moving beyond simple question answering and achieving a more robust and capable AI system. This needs to be done via the introduction of a more complicated and varied test data set to identify failures, and iterate on.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Develop a Challenging Test Suite:** Create a diverse dataset of questions that require:\n    *   **Multi-step reasoning:** Questions requiring combining information from different parts of the passage.\n    *   **Inference:** Questions where the answer is not explicitly stated but must be inferred.\n    *   **Ambiguity resolution:** Questions designed to test the system's ability to handle unclear or conflicting information.\n    *   **Numerical Reasoning:** Questions with calculations of varying complexity.\n    *   **Counterfactual questions**: \"What if...\" scenarios to test the system's understanding of the context.\n2.  **Implement Detailed Logging:** Enhance the system to log its reasoning process step-by-step. This should include:\n    *   The specific parts of the passage being considered.\n    *   The intermediate calculations or inferences being made.\n    *   The confidence level associated with each step.\n    *   Log timestamps, memory usage, and other performance metrics for optimization.\n3.  **Introduce Uncertainty Handling:** Integrate a mechanism for the system to express uncertainty and answer, \"I don't know,\" when it cannot confidently determine the answer.  This is crucial for avoiding incorrect responses and building trust in the system. Base the confidence level on a combination of the information retrieval accuracy and the complexity of the reasoning required.\n4.  **Investigate alternative modeling approaches.** Since the model currently can only answer simple questions, consider switching to a more advanced model capable of common-sense reasoning, such as Google's PaLM or OpenAI's GPT-4.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, it's impossible to accurately assess the capability trend. The system performs well on simple tasks, but its ability to handle more complex scenarios is unknown. To determine the capability trend, you *must* implement the actionable recommendations, particularly the creation of a challenging test suite and detailed logging, so that the performance of your AI can be comprehensively evaluated in future iterations.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using a chain-of-thought approach, breaking down the problem into identifying the transformation type, analyzing visual features, and then applying the transformation. It uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model in each of these steps, leveraging system instructions to define expert roles. The main function `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process, calling `identify_transformation_type`, `analyze_visual_features`, and `apply_transformation` in sequence and then validating the final result with `is_valid_grid`.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe error message \"Error: Invalid output grid format.\" is consistently present in all error cases. This strongly suggests that the system is failing to produce output that conforms to the expected grid format, leading to an error being raised. This could be caused by various issues such as incorrect dimensions, data types, or overall structure of the output array.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the lack of success cases, it's difficult to pinpoint specific strengths. However, the system's ability to at least *attempt* to solve the grid transformation tasks suggests some basic understanding of the problem and the ability to process input data. Further analysis of successful cases (if any existed) would be necessary to identify meaningful strengths.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Incorrect Pattern Recognition:** The system fails to correctly identify and apply the grid transformation patterns demonstrated in the training examples. This indicates a weakness in pattern recognition and generalization.\n2.  **Output Formatting Issues:** The consistent \"Invalid output grid format\" error demonstrates a critical weakness in the system's ability to generate output in the required format. This could be due to various reasons like incorrect dimensions, data types, or overall structure of the output array.\n3.  **Lack of Robust Error Handling/Debugging:** The system returns a generic error message without providing more specific information about the nature of the error or the stage at which the process failed. This limits the capacity to debug the system effectively.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Pattern Generalization:** The inability to generalize from training examples to the test input is the most significant bottleneck. Without correctly understanding the transformation rules, the system cannot produce the correct output.\n2.  **Output Formatting:** The inability to format the output as required is a critical technical bottleneck, regardless of whether the core logic is correct or not.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe main recurring pattern is the \"Invalid output grid format\" error. This highlights a fundamental issue with how the output grid is constructed. It suggests a consistent failure in either determining the correct dimensions, populating the grid with the correct values based on the inferred pattern, or encoding the final output grid.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the inability to translate the inferred pattern into a correctly formatted output grid. While the system might be inferring *some* aspect of the pattern, it's clearly failing to generate the final output in the expected format (specifically, the dimensions and population of the new grid).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system needs significant improvement in its ability to recognize patterns in the training examples and generalize them to new inputs. This could involve exploring different machine learning techniques or improving the existing algorithms.\n2.  **Output Formatting Logic:** The output formatting logic must be revised to ensure that it adheres to the required grid format consistently. This involves validating the dimensions of the output grid and ensuring the correct data types are used.\n3.  **Debugging and Error Reporting:** Enhance error reporting with more specific and informative messages that indicate the source and nature of the error. Intermediate outputs and print statements should be added to facilitate debugging.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Grid Dimension Validator:** Before attempting to populate the output grid, add a validator function that explicitly calculates and sets the grid dimensions based on the input grid and the inferred pattern. This will help prevent dimension-related errors.\n2.  **Add Data Type Enforcement:** Implement data type checking to ensure that all grid elements are of the correct type (e.g., integers). Use explicit type conversions if necessary.\n3.  **Refactor Output Generation Logic:** Break down the output generation process into smaller, more manageable functions with clear responsibilities. This will make the code easier to debug and maintain.\n4.  **Increase Training Data Variety:** Expand the training dataset to include a wider range of transformation patterns and grid sizes. This will help the system generalize better to new inputs.\n5.  **Implement a Debug Mode:** Add a debug mode that prints intermediate values and calculations, such as the inferred pattern, grid dimensions, and data types. This will greatly facilitate debugging and identifying the source of errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed to extract complete pattern logic.\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid output grid based on pattern.\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A (due to format error).\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed to extract complete pattern logic.\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid output grid based on pattern.\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A (due to format error).\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed to extract complete pattern logic.\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid output grid based on pattern.\n*   solution\\_verification: N/A (due to format error).\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and capability mappings.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs are remarkably consistent. Each sample results in the same \"Error: Invalid output grid format.\" message.  This indicates a systematic failure in the output generation process rather than isolated incidents.  The error occurs before any meaningful solution verification can take place, highlighting the fundamental nature of the problem. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags are correctly placed, which suggests that the basic input/output framework is functional, but the core logic is flawed.  The fact that the same error occurs across all samples suggests that the problem isn't input-dependent but rather inherent to the system's output pipeline.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the AI system exhibits *very* limited capabilities.  While it demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of processing input and producing *some* output, it fundamentally fails to generate output that conforms to the required format.  This results in a complete failure to solve the task.  The system's ability to extract and apply transformation patterns is effectively non-existent, as evidenced by the consistent error and the 0% accuracy. The system has successfully ingested the data, and raised an error.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Input Processing:** The system *can* process the input data and initiate an output process. The infrastructure for I/O exists.\n*   **Error Detection:** The system *does* detect that the output is in an invalid format, demonstrating a basic level of validation.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** The most critical weakness is the consistent failure to generate output in the correct grid format. This renders the entire system useless.\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The system shows no ability to generalize from training examples and identify the correct grid transformations.\n*   **Error Handling:** The generic error message provides insufficient information for debugging, hindering the ability to pinpoint the root cause.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Output Formatting**. Correcting this will allow the pattern recognition to be meaningfully assessed and potentially corrected. Without this foundational step, no progress can be made.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a strict Output Grid Schema Definition:**  Define a clear, explicit schema for the output grid, including the expected data types, dimensions, and structure.  Use this schema to validate the output *before* returning it.\n\n    *   **Code Example (Conceptual):**\n\n    ```python\n    class GridSchema:\n        def __init__(self, rows: int, cols: int, data_type: type):\n            self.rows = rows\n            self.cols = cols\n            self.data_type = data_type\n\n        def validate(self, grid):\n            if not isinstance(grid, list):\n                return False, \"Output is not a list\"\n            if len(grid) != self.rows:\n                return False, \"Incorrect number of rows\"\n            for row in grid:\n                if not isinstance(row, list):\n                    return False, \"Row is not a list\"\n                if len(row) != self.cols:\n                    return False, \"Incorrect number of columns in row\"\n                for cell in row:\n                    if not isinstance(cell, self.data_type):\n                        return False, f\"Incorrect data type: {type(cell)}, expected {self.data_type}\"\n            return True, None\n\n    # Example Usage\n    expected_schema = GridSchema(rows=5, cols=5, data_type=int) #This would be defined programatically\n    output_grid = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25]] #example of a valid output grid\n\n    is_valid, error_message = expected_schema.validate(output_grid)\n\n    if is_valid:\n        print(\"Output is valid\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Output is invalid: {error_message}\")\n    ```\n\n2.  **Add Output Grid Dimension Calculation:**  Implement a function that *explicitly* calculates the required dimensions of the output grid *before* attempting to create it. This function should take the input grid and the (inferred) transformation pattern as input.\n\n    *   **Example Dimension Calculation Function**\n        ```python\n        def calculate_output_dimensions(input_grid, transformation_pattern):\n            # Example: If the pattern doubles the size of the grid\n            if transformation_pattern == \"double\":\n                rows = len(input_grid) * 2\n                cols = len(input_grid[0]) * 2 # Assuming all rows have the same length\n                return rows, cols\n            #Add other rules here.\n            else:\n                # Default: Keep the dimensions the same\n                rows = len(input_grid)\n                cols = len(input_grid[0])\n                return rows, cols\n\n        input_grid = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n        transformation_pattern = \"double\"\n        output_rows, output_cols = calculate_output_dimensions(input_grid, transformation_pattern)\n        print(f\"Output grid dimensions: {output_rows} x {output_cols}\") #expect 4x4\n        ```\n\n3.  **Implement a \"Debug Mode\" Switch:** Add a simple boolean flag (e.g., `DEBUG_MODE = True`) that, when enabled, prints intermediate values, calculations, and decisions throughout the output generation process.  This will allow you to trace the execution flow and pinpoint where the formatting is going wrong.\n\n4.  **Provide Detailed Error Messages:**  Instead of just \"Invalid output grid format,\" provide *specific* reasons for the failure, such as \"Incorrect number of rows (expected X, got Y)\" or \"Data type mismatch in cell [row, col] (expected int, got str)\".\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable (Negative)**. The system consistently fails, indicating no improvement. However, the consistent nature of the failure provides a clear starting point for focused improvement efforts. Fixing the output format issues could potentially reveal hidden progress in pattern recognition.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script implements a Chain of Reasoning with Knowledge Base Augmentation and Iterative Validation using the Gemini LLM. The problem is decomposed into reasoning, validation, knowledge augmentation, and answer extraction steps, each handled by a specific agent. The `call_llm` function interacts with the Gemini API, and the workflow involves `initial_reasoning` to generate reasoning steps, `validate_reasoning` to check the steps, `augment_knowledge` to gather relevant information, `extract_answer` to formulate the answer, and `validate_answer` to ensure correctness. The `main` function orchestrates these steps sequentially, returning the final validated answer.",

This leads to incorrect answers despite having a logically sound reasoning process. The \"Augmented Knowledge\" section is the only point of failure currently.\n2.  **Difficulty in Distinguishing Between Similar Information:** The system appears to struggle with differentiating between related but distinct pieces of information (e.g., finding all appearances vs. the *specific* appearance count requested).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Incorrect Information Retrieval/Augmentation:** The system retrieves and relies on incorrect information for answering questions. This is the single most critical bottleneck, as it invalidates the entire reasoning process.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Knowledge Source Accuracy:** All errors stem from using information that isn't accurate. The reasoning is fine, but the information is false.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to consistently retrieve accurate and reliable information to populate the \"Augmented Knowledge\" section, causing downstream reasoning to be based on faulty premises. This can be further broken down to either the search itself or the information extraction from the search results.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Knowledge Source Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the accuracy and reliability of the sources used for knowledge augmentation.\n2.  **Information Extraction Robustness:** Improve the robustness of the information extraction process from retrieved sources, ensuring accurate and precise retrieval of the required data. Specifically look into cleaning and validation of the results.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement Source Ranking/Trust Scoring:** Assign a \"trust score\" to different knowledge sources based on their historical accuracy and reliability. Prioritize information from high-trust sources.\n2.  **Cross-Validation of Information:** When possible, cross-validate extracted information from multiple sources to identify and resolve discrepancies.\n3.  **Implement Fact-Checking Mechanisms:** Integrate a fact-checking module that can verify the extracted information against a ground-truth knowledge base (if available) or a set of established facts.\n4.  **Fine-tune the search and extraction:** Look at the specific calls made to extract the information and attempt to make them more precise.\n5.  **Implement a feedback loop:** Add a feedback loop mechanism that saves the search query along with the relevant part of the document where the answer was retrieved from. This should be done for correct and incorrect answers such that they can be analyzed later.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 1:** Information extraction failure.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** Information extraction failure.\n",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**System Version:** (Assume Version 1.0 for this report)\n**Analyst:** AI System Capability Analyst\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided execution outputs reveal a consistent pattern: the system demonstrates strong reasoning capabilities but struggles with retrieving and validating accurate information.\n\n*   **Sample 1 (Charles Saatchi):** The reasoning steps are logical and well-defined. The system correctly identifies the key entities and the target information. However, the \"Augmented Knowledge\" (Saatchi's first \"Young British Art\" show was in 1992) is incorrect, leading to an inaccurate final answer.\n*   **Sample 2 (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick):** Similar to Sample 1, the reasoning is sound. The system correctly identifies the actress and the TV series. However, the \"Augmented Knowledge\" (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick appeared in 13 episodes of \"Roar\") is inaccurate, resulting in an incorrect answer.\n*   **Sample 3 (Jean Galloway Bissell):** Again, the reasoning is correct. The system identifies the person and the target information. However, the \"Augmented Knowledge\" (Jean Galloway Bissell worked in private legal practice in Greenville from 1988 to 2003) is inaccurate, leading to an incorrect answer.\n\nIn all three cases, the failure stems directly from incorrect information within the \"Augmented Knowledge\" section. The system successfully parses and utilizes this information, but the information itself is flawed.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system possesses a moderate level of reasoning and information processing capability. Its strengths lie in logical problem-solving and structured question decomposition. However, its usefulness is severely limited by its reliance on potentially inaccurate external knowledge sources. The system demonstrates an ability to identify key information within a body of text. The system is currently unreliable due to the dependence on Augmented Knowledge which is often wrong.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Logical Reasoning:** The system demonstrates a clear and logical approach to problem-solving, breaking down questions into manageable steps.\n*   **Entity Recognition:** The system is proficient at identifying key entities within questions.\n*   **Structured Output:** The consistent format of \"Reasoning steps,\" \"Augmented Knowledge,\" and \"Extracted Answer\" facilitates analysis and debugging.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Knowledge Accuracy:** The system's Achilles' heel is its dependence on external knowledge and the lack of validation of that knowledge. Inaccurate or biased information leads to incorrect answers.\n*   **Lack of Information Verification:** The system doesn't appear to have mechanisms to verify the accuracy of the retrieved information.\n*   **Brittle Search and Retrieval:**  The search and retrieval process is overly sensitive to variations in phrasing or terminology, leading to potentially incomplete or inaccurate results.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Knowledge Accuracy and Verification**. The system's reasoning capabilities are rendered useless if the foundational knowledge it relies upon is flawed.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Source Ranking/Trust Scoring (Priority: High):** Implement a mechanism to assign \"trust scores\" to different knowledge sources based on their historical accuracy and reliability. Prioritize information from high-trust sources. This could be a simple hardcoded list initially, and then made more sophisticated over time.\n2.  **Cross-Validation of Information (Priority: High):** Whenever possible, cross-validate extracted information from multiple sources to identify and resolve discrepancies. If information from multiple sources contradicts, flag it for human review or implement a more sophisticated conflict resolution mechanism.\n3.  **Implement Fact-Checking Mechanisms (Priority: Medium):** Integrate a fact-checking module that can verify the extracted information against a ground-truth knowledge base (if available) or a set of established facts. This could involve querying a dedicated fact-checking API or using a local knowledge graph.\n4.  **Fine-tune the search and extraction (Priority: Medium):** Look at the specific calls made to extract the information and attempt to make them more precise. This may involve experimenting with different search queries, using more specific keywords, and refining the extraction logic.\n5.  **Implement a feedback loop (Priority: Low):** Add a feedback loop mechanism that saves the search query along with the relevant part of the document where the answer was retrieved from. This should be done for correct and incorrect answers such that they can be analyzed later. The goal here is to see which queries are working and which aren't along with what parts of the document contained the answer.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capability trend is **Stable but Unreliable**. The core reasoning capabilities are consistently applied, but the accuracy is low due to knowledge inaccuracies. Until the knowledge accuracy bottleneck is addressed, the system's overall capability will remain limited.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors are explicitly present in the provided 'output' fields.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Correct Entity Identification:** The system successfully identifies the key entities in the questions (e.g., Charles Saatchi, Gabrielle Fitzpatrick, Jean Galloway Bissell, \"Young British Art,\" \"Roar\").\n2.  **Clear Reasoning Steps:** The \"Reasoning steps\" outlined by the system demonstrate a logical approach to problem-solving, breaking down the question into smaller, manageable tasks.\n3. **Knowledge Augmentation:** The system attempts to find relevant information in \"Augmented Knowledge\" which seems generally useful if it has the correct information.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Reliance on External Knowledge and Potential for Inaccuracy:** The system's reliance on external \"Augmented Knowledge\" makes it vulnerable to inaccuracies or biases in the sources it consults. This leads to incorrect answers despite having a logically sound reasoning process. The \"Augmented Knowledge\" section is the only point of failure currently.\n2.  **Difficulty in Distinguishing Between Similar Information:** The system appears to struggle with differentiating between related but distinct pieces of information (e.g., finding all appearances vs. the *specific* appearance count requested).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Incorrect Information Retrieval/Augmentation:** The system retrieves and relies on incorrect information for answering questions. This is the single most critical bottleneck, as it invalidates the entire reasoning process.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Knowledge Source Accuracy:** All errors stem from using information that isn't accurate. The reasoning is fine, but the information is false.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to consistently retrieve accurate and reliable information to populate the \"Augmented Knowledge\" section, causing downstream reasoning to be based on faulty premises. This can be further broken down to either the search itself or the information extraction from the search results.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Knowledge Source Verification:** Implement mechanisms to verify the accuracy and reliability of the sources used for knowledge augmentation.\n2.  **Information Extraction Robustness:** Improve the robustness of the information extraction process from retrieved sources, ensuring accurate and precise retrieval of the required data. Specifically look into cleaning and validation of the results.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement Source Ranking/Trust Scoring:** Assign a \"trust score\" to different knowledge sources based on their historical accuracy and reliability. Prioritize information from high-trust sources.\n2.  **Cross-Validation of Information:** When possible, cross-validate extracted information from multiple sources to identify and resolve discrepancies.\n3.  **Implement Fact-Checking Mechanisms:** Integrate a fact-checking module that can verify the extracted information against a ground-truth knowledge base (if available) or a set of established facts.\n4.  **Fine-tune the search and extraction:** Look at the specific calls made to extract the information and attempt to make them more precise.\n5.  **Implement a feedback loop:** Add a feedback loop mechanism that saves the search query along with the relevant part of the document where the answer was retrieved from. This should be done for correct and incorrect answers such that they can be analyzed later.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 1:** Information extraction failure.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** Information extraction failure.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**System Version:** (Assume Version 1.0 for this report)\n**Analyst:** AI System Capability Analyst\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided execution outputs reveal a consistent pattern: the system demonstrates strong reasoning capabilities but struggles with retrieving and validating accurate information.\n\n*   **Sample 1 (Charles Saatchi):** The reasoning steps are logical and well-defined. The system correctly identifies the key entities and the target information. However, the \"Augmented Knowledge\" (Saatchi's first \"Young British Art\" show was in 1992) is incorrect, leading to an inaccurate final answer.\n*   **Sample 2 (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick):** Similar to Sample 1, the reasoning is sound. The system correctly identifies the actress and the TV series. However, the \"Augmented Knowledge\" (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick appeared in 13 episodes of \"Roar\") is inaccurate, resulting in an incorrect answer.\n*   **Sample 3 (Jean Galloway Bissell):** Again, the reasoning is correct. The system identifies the person and the target information. However, the \"Augmented Knowledge\" (Jean Galloway Bissell worked in private legal practice in Greenville from 1988 to 2003) is inaccurate, leading to an incorrect answer.\n\nIn all three cases, the failure stems directly from incorrect information within the \"Augmented Knowledge\" section. The system successfully parses and utilizes this information, but the information itself is flawed.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system possesses a moderate level of reasoning and information processing capability. Its strengths lie in logical problem-solving and structured question decomposition. However, its usefulness is severely limited by its reliance on potentially inaccurate external knowledge sources. The system demonstrates an ability to identify key information within a body of text. The system is currently unreliable due to the dependence on Augmented Knowledge which is often wrong.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Logical Reasoning:** The system demonstrates a clear and logical approach to problem-solving, breaking down questions into manageable steps.\n*   **Entity Recognition:** The system is proficient at identifying key entities within questions.\n*   **Structured Output:** The consistent format of \"Reasoning steps,\" \"Augmented Knowledge,\" and \"Extracted Answer\" facilitates analysis and debugging.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Knowledge Accuracy:** The system's Achilles' heel is its dependence on external knowledge and the lack of validation of that knowledge.

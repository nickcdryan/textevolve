  "approach_summary": "The script uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach combined with a validation loop to answer questions. It decomposes the problem into query generation, search snippet retrieval (simulated), answer generation, and solution validation. The agent roles are a search query generator, a search snippet validator, an answer generator, and a solution validator.\n\nThe main functions are:\n- `call_llm`: calls the Gemini LLM with specified prompts and configurations.\n- `generate_query_and_validate`: generates a search query for a question and validates the relevance of the search snippets using the LLM. It uses `call_llm`.\n- `generate_answer_with_snippets`: generates an answer to the question based on the search snippets using the LLM. It uses `call_llm`.\n- `solve_with_validation_loop`: orchestrates the entire process, iteratively refining the solution based on validation feedback. It calls `generate_query_and_validate` and `generate_answer_with_snippets`.\n- `main`: calls `solve_with_validation_loop` to get the final answer, returns it.\n\nThe workflow involves generating a search query, validating its results, generating an answer from the validated snippets, and then iteratively validating and refining the answer until a valid solution is found or the maximum attempts are reached.",

The errors are primarily semantic, stemming from an inability to find correct information or extract/process it accurately.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   The system can often identify when information is not found.\n*   The system can sometimes correctly extract relevant information when it is readily available.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   Information Retrieval: The system struggles to consistently find the correct information required to answer the question, even when the information is likely available online.\n*   Information Accuracy: When the system does find information, it doesn't always extract it accurately (e.g., Gliese 146 magnitude). This could be due to misinterpreting context or relying on incorrect sources.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Reliable Information Retrieval:** Consistently finding the right information sources and snippets to answer the question is a major bottleneck.\n*   **Accurate Information Extraction:** Extracting accurate and correct information from the retrieved snippets is another critical bottleneck. Even if the correct information exists, the system is failing to extract it properly.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Answer Not Found/Incomplete Information:** A recurring pattern is the system reporting that it cannot find the answer, indicating either a search failure or an inability to locate the relevant information within the retrieved snippets.\n*   **Incorrect Numerical Values:** Another pattern is providing incorrect numerical values, suggesting potential issues in information extraction or data parsing.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is **inaccurate information extraction from the retrieved text**. The system is either failing to locate the precise answer within the source text or misinterpreting it, leading to either \"Answer not found\" responses or incorrect answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Improve the search query formulation to retrieve more relevant information sources.\n*   **Information Extraction:** Enhance the system's ability to accurately extract numerical values and specific details from the retrieved text snippets.

All three samples exhibit problems:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** Fails to find an answer altogether, indicating a failure in information retrieval and/or extraction.\n*   **Sample 1:** Explicitly states that the information is not found, again pointing to retrieval/extraction problems. The specific mention of the \"provided search snippets\" suggests the search itself might be working, but the relevant data isn't present within the results.\n*   **Sample 2:** Provides an answer, but based on the 0% accuracy rate, the provided magnitude value is likely incorrect (needs verification). This underscores the \"Accurate Information Extraction\" bottleneck. Even when an answer is provided, it's unreliable.\n\nThe outputs consistently demonstrate the problem of extracting the *correct* answer, even when some information is found.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities. While it can sometimes identify when information is missing, its primary functions of information retrieval and, more critically, accurate information extraction are severely deficient. It is essentially non-functional in its current state.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Awareness of Missing Information (Sometimes):** The system sometimes recognizes when it cannot find an answer (as seen in Samples 0 and 1). This is a positive sign that it's not blindly guessing, but it's not consistently applied.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** This is the dominant and most critical weakness. The system frequently provides incorrect or nonexistent answers.\n*   **Unreliable Information Retrieval:** The system struggles to find relevant information, even when it should be readily available. This contributes to the \"Answer Not Found\" responses.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to improve is **Accurate Information Extraction**. Improving information retrieval is important, but even perfect retrieval is useless if the system cannot extract the *correct* answer from the retrieved text.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThese recommendations are prioritized based on the immediate need to improve information extraction accuracy:\n\n1.  **Implement Robust Information Extraction Techniques:**\n    *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER) Improvement:** Enhance NER to accurately identify entities like numbers, dates, and specific names related to the question. Fine-tune the model on a dataset specific to the target knowledge domain.\n    *   **Relation Extraction Implementation:** Use relation extraction models to understand relationships between entities within the retrieved text. This will help the system connect relevant pieces of information. For example, if the question is about graduation year, relation extraction should identify \"graduated in\" relationships.\n    *   **Information Verification Module:** Implement a module that attempts to verify extracted information against known facts or common sense rules. Example: Check if a year is within a reasonable range. Check that a measurement unit (like magnitude) is being extracted together with the numerical value.\n2.  **Detailed Logging and Monitoring (Critical for Debugging):**\n    *   **Implement Print Statements/Logging:** Add extensive print statements (or better yet, a robust logging system) to track the entire process: search query, retrieved snippets, identified entities, extracted values, and the final reasoning step. This is crucial for understanding *why* the system is failing.\n    *   **Example Logging:** Log:\n        *   The exact search query used.\n        *   The full text of the top N search snippets retrieved.\n        *   All entities recognized by the NER system within each snippet.\n        *   The specific values extracted for relevant properties (e.g., magnitude, date).\n        *   The system's confidence score for each extracted value.\n        *   Reasons why the system selected a particular answer.\n3.  **Immediate Dataset Curation:**\n    *   **Identify Incorrectly Answered Questions:** Review questions the model answers incorrectly.\n    *   **Identify Relevant Information:** Find the relevant passages of text that do contain the correct answer.\n    *   **Use the questions and the relevant text to fine tune the models.**\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the 0% accuracy, the capability trend is **declining**. The system is effectively not performing its intended function. Immediate and significant improvements are required.\n",

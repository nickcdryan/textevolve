  "approach_summary": "This script schedules meetings by first using an LLM to extract structured constraints from the input question, including participants, duration, and schedules. It then generates possible time slots and verifies each slot's availability against participant schedules, using another LLM call for verification with embedded examples. The overall workflow involves information extraction by LLM, time slot generation via code, and verification via LLM, effectively combining both LLM reasoning and Python-based logic.",

The system is designed with an explicit error message (\"Error: Could not extract meeting details.\") which allows for easy identification of the failure point.\n2.  The system attempts to solve complex scheduling problems, indicating a degree of sophistication in its design.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system frequently fails in the initial step of information extraction, leading to a complete breakdown in performance. This suggests a lack of robustness in handling variations in input format or complexity.\n2.  The error message \"Could not extract meeting details\" is too generic and doesn't provide specific information to debug the underlying cause.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The inability to reliably extract key details (participants, duration, time constraints, existing schedules) is the primary bottleneck. Without this information, no further reasoning or solution generation is possible.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent \"Could not extract meeting details\" error:** This error message occurs in all cases, indicating a systemic issue with the information extraction module.\n2.  **Failure across varying participant counts and complexities:** The errors occur both with smaller (2 participants) and larger (6 participants) meeting scheduling tasks.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure to robustly parse and extract the participant list and their schedules from the input text.** The system relies on an overly rigid or incomplete parsing mechanism that is easily broken by variations in input phrasing and formatting. The error message is too general; it masks the more precise reason, such as failing to parse the participant list or failing to identify schedule constraints for a specific participant.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** This area requires the most improvement. The system needs to reliably extract participant names, meeting duration, time constraints, and individual schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace brittle parsing with LLM-driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   **INSTEAD OF**: Complex regex patterns or hand-coded parsing logic.\n    *   **USE**: LLM calls with clear extraction prompts. For example:\n        *   `extract_participants(text)`: \"Extract the names of all participants in the meeting scheduling task.\"\n        *   `extract_duration(text)`: \"Extract the meeting duration in minutes or hours.\"\n        *   `extract_time_constraints(text)`: \"Extract the earliest and latest possible meeting times on each day.\"\n        *   `extract_schedule(text, participant_name)`: \"Extract the unavailable time slots for {participant_name} on each day. Return the answer in a structured format (e.g., Monday: 9:30-10:30, 13:00-13:30).\"\n    *   **EXAMPLE**: Instead of `re.search(r\"schedule a meeting for (.*?) for\", line)`, use `llm_extract_participants(line)`. The LLM is much more likely to handle variations in wording.\n2.  **Implement Verification for Extracted Information**:\n    *   After extracting each piece of information, use an LLM to verify its correctness and completeness.\n    *   For example:\n        *   `verify_participants(participants, text)`: \"Verify that the list of participants {participants} accurately reflects the participants mentioned in the original text. If any participants are missing or incorrect, identify them.\"\n3.  **Provide More Specific Error Messages**:\n    *   Instead of a generic \"Could not extract meeting details,\" provide specific error messages like:\n        *   \"Could not extract participant names.\"\n        *   \"Could not extract meeting duration.\"\n        *   \"Could not extract schedule for [participant name].\"\n        *   \"Could not extract the correct meeting day\".\n4.  **Implement a Fallback Strategy**:\n    *   If the initial information extraction fails, implement a fallback strategy that attempts to extract the information using a different approach or prompts the user for clarification.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates extremely limited capability in the domain of meeting scheduling, evidenced by a complete failure to accurately process even a small set of input samples. The core issue lies in the system's inability to reliably extract key information from the input text, specifically the participant list and their schedules. While the system's design includes features for error handling and complex scheduling, these are rendered useless by the fundamental failure to perform information extraction. This indicates a need to fundamentally rethink the system's approach to parsing and understanding the input.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Explicit Error Messaging:** The system's design incorporates clear error messages, facilitating the rapid identification of failure points within the workflow. This is a valuable design choice that should be retained.\n2.  **Attempt at Complex Scheduling:** The system is designed to handle scheduling tasks that involve multiple participants and potentially conflicting schedules, indicating an intent towards a more advanced functionality that should be built upon.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Fragile Information Extraction:** The system's information extraction module is exceptionally brittle and prone to failure, hindering all subsequent processing steps. This is the most significant weakness.\n2.  **Generic Error Messages:** While the system generates error messages, their lack of specificity obscures the underlying causes of the errors, complicating the debugging process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. Without accurate and reliable extraction of key information, the system cannot perform any meaningful task.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   Replace the current parsing method with an LLM-driven approach. This should involve:\n        *   Defining clear prompts for extracting key pieces of information (participants, duration, time constraints, schedules).\n        *   Utilizing separate LLM calls for each piece of information.\n        *   Refrain from using brittle regex or rule-based parsing.\n    *   Example Prompts:\n        *   `extract_participants(text)`: \"Identify all individuals participating in the meeting and return their names.\"\n        *   `extract_duration(text)`: \"Determine the requested meeting duration in minutes. If duration is not explicitly defined, return 'unspecified'.\"\n        *   `extract_time_constraints(text)`: \"From the provided text, extract the earliest and latest acceptable times for the meeting to take place on each day. Return 'none' if there are no explicitly mentioned constraints.\"\n        *   `extract_schedule(text, participant_name)`: \"List the existing appointments/busy times for {participant_name} on each day that would prevent them from attending a meeting. Format the results as 'Day: Start Time - End Time'.\"\n2.  **Implement LLM-Driven Verification of Extracted Information:**\n    *   Develop a verification mechanism that uses an LLM to confirm the correctness and completeness of the extracted information.\n    *   Prompt: \"Verify that the following participant list accurately reflects the individuals mentioned in the original text. If any names are missing, incorrect, or unclear, clearly identify the discrepancies. Participant List: {participant_list}. Original Text: {original_text}.\"\n3.  **Refine Error Messages for Specificity:**\n    *   Replace the generic error message with more descriptive messages that pinpoint the specific failure.\n    *   Examples:\n        *   \"Error: Failed to identify the participants.\"\n        *   \"Error: Could not determine the meeting duration.\"\n        *   \"Error: Unable to extract schedule for [participant_name].\"\n4. **Iterative LLM prompting:**\n    * Implement iterative prompting in the LLM to improve accuracy.\n    * Try providing more context, examples, or rephrasing the questions in the extraction process.\n    * Prompts to use include:\n        * \"Can you extract all of the names from the text?\"\n        * \"Please list all of the names found from the text, without the use of outside tools\"\n        * \"You will be given the text, and you are to extract the names of people in the text. Can you provide them?\"\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the system exhibits a **declining** capability trend, as it is fundamentally unable to perform the core task for which it was designed. Addressing the weaknesses in information extraction is critical to reversing this trend.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system is designed with an explicit error message (\"Error: Could not extract meeting details.\") which allows for easy identification of the failure point.\n2.  The system attempts to solve complex scheduling problems, indicating a degree of sophistication in its design.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system frequently fails in the initial step of information extraction, leading to a complete breakdown in performance. This suggests a lack of robustness in handling variations in input format or complexity.\n2.  The error message \"Could not extract meeting details\" is too generic and doesn't provide specific information to debug the underlying cause.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The inability to reliably extract key details (participants, duration, time constraints, existing schedules) is the primary bottleneck. Without this information, no further reasoning or solution generation is possible.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent \"Could not extract meeting details\" error:** This error message occurs in all cases, indicating a systemic issue with the information extraction module.\n2.  **Failure across varying participant counts and complexities:** The errors occur both with smaller (2 participants) and larger (6 participants) meeting scheduling tasks.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure to robustly parse and extract the participant list and their schedules from the input text.** The system relies on an overly rigid or incomplete parsing mechanism that is easily broken by variations in input phrasing and formatting. The error message is too general; it masks the more precise reason, such as failing to parse the participant list or failing to identify schedule constraints for a specific participant.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** This area requires the most improvement. The system needs to reliably extract participant names, meeting duration, time constraints, and individual schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace brittle parsing with LLM-driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   **INSTEAD OF**: Complex regex patterns or hand-coded parsing logic.\n    *   **USE**: LLM calls with clear extraction prompts. For example:\n        *   `extract_participants(text)`: \"Extract the names of all participants in the meeting scheduling task.\"\n        *   `extract_duration(text)`: \"Extract the meeting duration in minutes or hours.\"\n        *   `extract_time_constraints(text)`: \"Extract the earliest and latest possible meeting times on each day.\"\n        *   `extract_schedule(text, participant_name)`: \"Extract the unavailable time slots for {participant_name} on each day. Return the answer in a structured format (e.g., Monday: 9:30-10:30, 13:00-13:30).\"\n    *   **EXAMPLE**: Instead of `re.search(r\"schedule a meeting for (.*?) for\", line)`, use `llm_extract_participants(line)`. The LLM is much more likely to handle variations in wording.\n2.  **Implement Verification for Extracted Information**:\n    *   After extracting each piece of information, use an LLM to verify its correctness and completeness.\n    *   For example:\n        *   `verify_participants(participants, text)`: \"Verify that the list of participants {participants} accurately reflects the participants mentioned in the original text. If any participants are missing or incorrect, identify them.\"\n3.  **Provide More Specific Error Messages**:\n    *   Instead of a generic \"Could not extract meeting details,\" provide specific error messages like:\n        *   \"Could not extract participant names.\"\n        *   \"Could not extract meeting duration.\"\n        *   \"Could not extract schedule for [participant name].\"\n        *   \"Could not extract the correct meeting day\".\n4.  **Implement a Fallback Strategy**:\n    *   If the initial information extraction fails, implement a fallback strategy that attempts to extract the information using a different approach or prompts the user for clarification.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates extremely limited capability in the domain of meeting scheduling, evidenced by a complete failure to accurately process even a small set of input samples. The core issue lies in the system's inability to reliably extract key information from the input text, specifically the participant list and their schedules. While the system's design includes features for error handling and complex scheduling, these are rendered useless by the fundamental failure to perform information extraction. This indicates a need to fundamentally rethink the system's approach to parsing and understanding the input.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Explicit Error Messaging:** The system's design incorporates clear error messages, facilitating the rapid identification of failure points within the workflow. This is a valuable design choice that should be retained.\n2.  **Attempt at Complex Scheduling:** The system is designed to handle scheduling tasks that involve multiple participants and potentially conflicting schedules, indicating an intent towards a more advanced functionality that should be built upon.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Fragile Information Extraction:** The system's information extraction module is exceptionally brittle and prone to failure, hindering all subsequent processing steps. This is the most significant weakness.\n2.  **Generic Error Messages:** While the system generates error messages, their lack of specificity obscures the underlying causes of the errors, complicating the debugging process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. Without accurate and reliable extraction of key information, the system cannot perform any meaningful task.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   Replace the current parsing method with an LLM-driven approach. This should involve:\n        *   Defining clear prompts for extracting key pieces of information (participants, duration, time constraints, schedules).\n        *   Utilizing separate LLM calls for each piece of information.\n        *   Refrain from using brittle regex or rule-based parsing.\n    *   Example Prompts:\n        *   `extract_participants(text)`: \"Identify all individuals participating in the meeting and return their names.\"\n        *   `extract_duration(text)`: \"Determine the requested meeting duration in minutes. If duration is not explicitly defined, return 'unspecified'.\"\n        *   `extract_time_constraints(text)`: \"From the provided text, extract the earliest and latest acceptable times for the meeting to take place on each day. Return 'none' if there are no explicitly mentioned constraints.\"\n        *   `extract_schedule(text, participant_name)`: \"List the existing appointments/busy times for {participant_name} on each day that would prevent them from attending a meeting. Format the results as 'Day: Start Time - End Time'.\"\n2.  **Implement LLM-Driven Verification of Extracted Information:**\n    *   Develop a verification mechanism that uses an LLM to confirm the correctness and completeness of the extracted information.\n    *   Prompt: \"Verify that the following participant list accurately reflects the individuals mentioned in the original text. If any names are missing, incorrect, or unclear, clearly identify the discrepancies. Participant List: {participant_list}. Original Text: {original_text}.\"\n3.  **Refine Error Messages for Specificity:**\n    *   Replace the generic error message with more descriptive messages that pinpoint the specific failure.\n    *   Examples:\n        *   \"Error: Failed to identify the participants.\"\n        *   \"Error: Could not determine the meeting duration.\"\n        *   \"Error: Unable to extract schedule for [participant_name].\"\n4. **Iterative LLM prompting:**\n    * Implement iterative prompting in the LLM to improve accuracy.\n    * Try providing more context, examples, or rephrasing the questions in the extraction process.\n    * Prompts to use include:\n        * \"Can you extract all of the names from the text?\"\n        * \"Please list all of the names found from the text, without the use of outside tools\"\n        * \"You will be given the text, and you are to extract the names of people in the text. Can you provide them?\"\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the system exhibits a **declining** capability trend, as it is fundamentally unable to perform the core task for which it was designed. Addressing the weaknesses in information extraction is critical to reversing this trend.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to answer questions by first determining the question type, then extracting relevant information, and finally generating the answer. It decomposes the problem into three distinct steps, each handled by a dedicated function acting as an agent with a specific role (question type classifier, information extractor, and answer generator). The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini model, using prompt engineering with examples to guide the LLM at each step. The functions are `main` which orchestrates the process, `determine_question_type` which classifies the question, `extract_relevant_info` which extracts information from the text based on the question, `generate_answer` which creates the final answer, and `call_llm` which sends and receives responses from the Gemini LLM.",

As the German army seized Helsinki, the White Army shifted the military focus to Vyborg area, where 18,500 Whites advanced against 15,000 defending Reds.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Raiders, the Broncos traveled to Heinz Field to face the Pittsburgh Steelers. On the Broncos' first offensive possession, running back Ronnie Hillman committed a fumble deep in their own territory, and the Steelers capitalized two plays later, with a 2-yard touchdown run by running back DeAngelo Williams. The Broncos reeled off 20 unanswered points, with quarterback Brock Osweiler throwing a pair of touchdown passes - an 18-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and a 61-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, followed in the second quarter by Osweiler scrambling for a 7-yard touchdown. The latter score came after the Broncos' defense intercepted Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, and also had a missed extra-point attempt by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Steelers then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Chris Boswell. The Broncos then increased their lead to 27-10, with Osweiler connecting with Thomas on a 6-yard touchdown pass at the 2-minute warning. However, it would be the Broncos' final scoring play of the game, as the offense was shut out in the second half for the third consecutive week. The Steelers pulled to within 27-13, with Boswell kicking a 41-yard field goal just before halftime. Midway through the third quarter, Roethlisberger connected with wide receiver Antonio Brown on a 9-yard touchdown. Later in the third quarter, Broncos' return specialist Jordan Norwood returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown; however, the touchdown was nullified by an illegal substitution penalty. Following a Broncos' three-and-out, the Steelers tied the game early in the fourth quarter, with Roethlisberger throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Markus Wheaton. Each team proceeded to trade punt on their next two possessions, and with just over five minutes remaining, Osweiler was intercepted by Steelers' linebacker Ryan Shazier at the Broncos' 37-yard line, and three plays later, the Steelers re-claimed the lead, with a 23-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. The Broncos then marched down to the Steelers' 36-yard line with 2:17 remaining, but turned the football over on downs. Just before the two-minute warning, the Steelers were attempting to run out the clock, however, Roethlisberger chose to pass the football, and was intercepted by linebacker Brandon Marshall just before the two-minute warning, giving the Broncos one last possession.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Frederick had been King of Jerusalem\u2014and as such claimed suzerainty over Cyprus\u2014in right of his wife Isabella II until her death in 1228. That year he arrived first in Cyprus, where he antagonised the nobles, and then in Jerusalem, where he stayed until 1229, leaving in humiliating circumstances after having produced an anti-imperialist reaction in the people. In 1231 he sent Riccardo Filangieri as his marshal. His attempt to assert his authority was opposed by John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, who had been regent until Frederick's arrival. On John's death in 1236 the war was taken up by his son Balian. In 1239 Philip of Montfort assumed the leadership of the opposition. Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. He also held the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, which had been negotiated away from the Saracens by Frederick. So long as the Ibelins controlled the opposition, Filangieri could count on the support of their enemies as well. The Italian cities were also divided between the two factions: Pisa supported Filangieri and Genoa the Ibelins. The Ibelins controlled Beirut, Arsuf, and Caesarea as well as the old capital of Acre. In 1231 the citizens of Acre formed a commune with their headquarters at the church of Saint Andrew's in order to unify their opposition to Filangieri.

On the Broncos' first offensive possession, running back Ronnie Hillman committed a fumble deep in their own territory, and the Steelers capitalized two plays later, with a 2-yard touchdown run by running back DeAngelo Williams. The Broncos reeled off 20 unanswered points, with quarterback Brock Osweiler throwing a pair of touchdown passes - an 18-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and a 61-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, followed in the second quarter by Osweiler scrambling for a 7-yard touchdown. The latter score came after the Broncos' defense intercepted Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, and also had a missed extra-point attempt by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Steelers then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Chris Boswell. The Broncos then increased their lead to 27-10, with Osweiler connecting with Thomas on a 6-yard touchdown pass at the 2-minute warning. However, it would be the Broncos' final scoring play of the game, as the offense was shut out in the second half for the third consecutive week. The Steelers pulled to within 27-13, with Boswell kicking a 41-yard field goal just before halftime. Midway through the third quarter, Roethlisberger connected with wide receiver Antonio Brown on a 9-yard touchdown. Later in the third quarter, Broncos' return specialist Jordan Norwood returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown; however, the touchdown was nullified by an illegal substitution penalty. Following a Broncos' three-and-out, the Steelers tied the game early in the fourth quarter, with Roethlisberger throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Markus Wheaton. Each team proceeded to trade punt on their next two possessions, and with just over five minutes remaining, Osweiler was intercepted by Steelers' linebacker Ryan Shazier at the Broncos' 37-yard line, and three plays later, the Steelers re-claimed the lead, with a 23-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. The Broncos then marched down to the Steelers' 36-yard line with 2:17 remaining, but turned the football over on downs. Just before the two-minute warning, the Steelers were attempting to run out the clock, however, Roethlisberger chose to pass the football, and was intercepted by linebacker Brandon Marshall just before the two-minute warning, giving the Broncos one last possession.

That year he arrived first in Cyprus, where he antagonised the nobles, and then in Jerusalem, where he stayed until 1229, leaving in humiliating circumstances after having produced an anti-imperialist reaction in the people. In 1231 he sent Riccardo Filangieri as his marshal. His attempt to assert his authority was opposed by John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, who had been regent until Frederick's arrival. On John's death in 1236 the war was taken up by his son Balian. In 1239 Philip of Montfort assumed the leadership of the opposition. Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. He also held the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, which had been negotiated away from the Saracens by Frederick. So long as the Ibelins controlled the opposition, Filangieri could count on the support of their enemies as well. The Italian cities were also divided between the two factions: Pisa supported Filangieri and Genoa the Ibelins. The Ibelins controlled Beirut, Arsuf, and Caesarea as well as the old capital of Acre. In 1231 the citizens of Acre formed a commune with their headquarters at the church of Saint Andrew's in order to unify their opposition to Filangieri. In 1232 John of Ibelin was elected its mayor.",

David Garrard, making his third consecutive start in place of Byron Leftwich, was intercepted four times. Two came after Matt Jones bobbled perfect passes. Ernest Wilford also dropped two balls, including a deep one that could have been a touchdown. Carr directed a 70-yard drive to start the game and had two key runs. Wali Lundy scored from 1 yard, then Houston took advantage of Garrard's first turnover to make it 10-0. DeMeco Ryans pressured Garrard and forced a floater over the middle.

The system isn't capable of weighing information to determine which details are most pertinent.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe primary error pattern is misinterpretation of the question's intent leading to incorrect information extraction. The system extracts numerical values that are related to the question keywords, but are not the precise values needed to answer the question.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is a flawed strategy for mapping the question to the specific numerical data within the passage that is relevant for calculation. The current approach seems to rely too heavily on keyword matching without sufficient contextual understanding of the question's intent.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Question Intent Analysis:** Implement a more sophisticated module that analyzes the question and understands the type of information required to answer it. This module should identify the key entities and relationships that are being queried.\n2.  **Contextual Information Selection:** Develop a method for identifying and prioritizing relevant information within the passage based on the question's intent. This may involve techniques like semantic similarity scoring, dependency parsing, or named entity recognition.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement Semantic Parsing:** Utilize semantic parsing techniques to better understand the meaning of both the question and the passage. This can help to identify the correct numerical values and operations needed to arrive at the answer.\n2.  **Develop a Scoring Mechanism for Information Relevance:** Implement a system that scores the relevance of different pieces of information in the passage based on their relationship to the question. This score can be used to prioritize information during extraction and calculation.\n3.  **Fine-tune a Language Model:** Fine-tune a pre-trained language model specifically for question answering tasks that involve numerical reasoning. This can improve the model's ability to understand the nuances of natural language and extract the correct information.\n4.  **Enhance Output Explanations:** The explanations provided should explicitly state *why* certain information was selected and other information was discarded, demonstrating a clear decision-making process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID: 0**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the relevant information.\n    *   decision_making: Failed to choose the correct years to use for determining the duration.\n",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs, the following capability assessment is provided:**\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs reveal a pattern of numerical calculation errors stemming from incorrect information extraction.\n\n*   **Example 1 (Error Sample):** The desired calculation was to determine a duration. Instead of identifying and subtracting the correct start and end dates, the system selected unrelated numbers, leading to a calculation that is arithmetically correct but contextually meaningless. The output provides the calculation `2018 - 2001 = 17 years`, which is incorrect.\n*   **Example 2 (Success Sample):** The system can perform accurate subtraction when the correct inputs are identified and extracted.\n*   **Example 3 (Success Sample):** The system correctly identifies relevant categorical information in the text.\n\nThis analysis confirms the weakness identified in the error analysis: the system's struggle to understand question intent and select the appropriate information. The system exhibits a propensity to extract values related to keywords but without understanding the contextual relationship to the question.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic numerical reasoning and information extraction capabilities but struggles with contextual understanding and question interpretation. It can perform calculations accurately *if* provided with the correct inputs, but it frequently fails to identify those inputs in the first place. Overall, the system is promising but needs substantial improvement in understanding the nuances of natural language.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Arithmetic Calculation:** Accurate execution of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction). This needs to be preserved as it is a fundamental requirement.\n*   **Categorical Information Extraction:** Successful extraction of non-numerical entities (e.g., team names).\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Significant deficiency in understanding the context of questions and passages. This is the root cause of most observed errors.\n*   **Intent Recognition:** Failure to accurately determine the precise information requested in a question.\n*   **Information Prioritization:** Inability to prioritize relevant information over irrelevant data points.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Contextual Understanding and Question Intent Analysis**. All other improvements are contingent upon addressing this fundamental weakness. The system must better interpret the question and map it to the relevant parts of the provided text.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Question Decomposition Strategy:** Break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions. This allows the system to focus on specific aspects of the question and extract relevant information more effectively. For example, the \"duration\" question should be decomposed into \"find the start date\" and \"find the end date\" before attempting to calculate the difference.\n\n2.  **Develop a Context-Aware Information Selection Module:** Instead of relying solely on keyword matching, implement a module that considers the context of the question and passage when selecting relevant information. This could involve techniques like semantic similarity scoring, dependency parsing, or knowledge graph integration. Specifically:\n    *   **Semantic Similarity Scoring:** Calculate the semantic similarity between the question and different sentences or phrases in the passage. Prioritize information from sentences with high similarity scores.\n    *   **Dependency Parsing:** Use dependency parsing to identify the relationships between words in the question and passage. This can help to determine which entities and concepts are most relevant to the question.\n\n3.  **Enhance Error Feedback Mechanism:** For each incorrect answer, provide detailed feedback on *why* the answer was wrong and *how* the system arrived at that answer. This will help the system learn from its mistakes and improve its accuracy over time. Use the identified error patterns to create targeted training examples that address specific weaknesses.\n\n4.  **Implement a Rule-Based System for Numerical Unit Handling:** Create a rule-based system that understands different units of measurement (e.g., years, months, days) and can convert between them if necessary. This will help to ensure that the system is performing calculations on compatible units.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but with significant room for improvement**. While the system demonstrates some proficiency in basic tasks, its lack of contextual understanding prevents it from consistently delivering accurate results. Addressing the identified weaknesses is critical for unlocking the system's full potential and achieving meaningful performance gains.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors were detected in the provided error cases or success cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Numerical Calculation:** The system can accurately perform basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction to arrive at numerical answers.\n2.  **Information Extraction:** The system can extract relevant numerical values and entities from the text.\n3.  **Logical Reasoning:** The system can successfully perform basic logical comparisons and date-related reasoning when it identifies the correct pieces of information.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Misinterpretation of Question Intent:** The system struggles to understand the precise intent of the question and, therefore, extracts the wrong information from the passage for its calculations.\n2.  **Inability to Distinguish Relevant vs. Irrelevant Information:** The system seems to lack the ability to discern the most important information required to answer the question from the provided text, especially when faced with multiple numerical data points.\n3.  **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system needs better contextual understanding of the problem.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Question Understanding and Information Selection:** The system is failing to select the correct data to perform calculations on, indicating a problem with question understanding and linking the correct part of the passage to the question.\n2.  **Prioritization of Information:** Lacking strategy in handling competing information within the passage. The system isn't capable of weighing information to determine which details are most pertinent.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe primary error pattern is misinterpretation of the question's intent leading to incorrect information extraction. The system extracts numerical values that are related to the question keywords, but are not the precise values needed to answer the question.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is a flawed strategy for mapping the question to the specific numerical data within the passage that is relevant for calculation. The current approach seems to rely too heavily on keyword matching without sufficient contextual understanding of the question's intent.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Question Intent Analysis:** Implement a more sophisticated module that analyzes the question and understands the type of information required to answer it. This module should identify the key entities and relationships that are being queried.\n2.  **Contextual Information Selection:** Develop a method for identifying and prioritizing relevant information within the passage based on the question's intent. This may involve techniques like semantic similarity scoring, dependency parsing, or named entity recognition.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement Semantic Parsing:** Utilize semantic parsing techniques to better understand the meaning of both the question and the passage. This can help to identify the correct numerical values and operations needed to arrive at the answer.\n2.  **Develop a Scoring Mechanism for Information Relevance:** Implement a system that scores the relevance of different pieces of information in the passage based on their relationship to the question. This score can be used to prioritize information during extraction and calculation.\n3.  **Fine-tune a Language Model:** Fine-tune a pre-trained language model specifically for question answering tasks that involve numerical reasoning. This can improve the model's ability to understand the nuances of natural language and extract the correct information.\n4.  **Enhance Output Explanations:** The explanations provided should explicitly state *why* certain information was selected and other information was discarded, demonstrating a clear decision-making process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID: 0**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the relevant information.\n    *   decision_making: Failed to choose the correct years to use for determining the duration.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs, the following capability assessment is provided:**\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs reveal a pattern of numerical calculation errors stemming from incorrect information extraction.\n\n*   **Example 1 (Error Sample):** The desired calculation was to determine a duration. Instead of identifying and subtracting the correct start and end dates, the system selected unrelated numbers, leading to a calculation that is arithmetically correct but contextually meaningless. The output provides the calculation `2018 - 2001 = 17 years`, which is incorrect.\n*   **Example 2 (Success Sample):** The system can perform accurate subtraction when the correct inputs are identified and extracted.\n*   **Example 3 (Success Sample):** The system correctly identifies relevant categorical information in the text.\n\nThis analysis confirms the weakness identified in the error analysis: the system's struggle to understand question intent and select the appropriate information. The system exhibits a propensity to extract values related to keywords but without understanding the contextual relationship to the question.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic numerical reasoning and information extraction capabilities but struggles with contextual understanding and question interpretation. It can perform calculations accurately *if* provided with the correct inputs, but it frequently fails to identify those inputs in the first place. Overall, the system is promising but needs substantial improvement in understanding the nuances of natural language.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Arithmetic Calculation:** Accurate execution of arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction). This needs to be preserved as it is a fundamental requirement.\n*   **Categorical Information Extraction:** Successful extraction of non-numerical entities (e.g., team names).\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Significant deficiency in understanding the context of questions and passages. This is the root cause of most observed errors.\n*   **Intent Recognition:** Failure to accurately determine the precise information requested in a question.\n*   **Information Prioritization:** Inability to prioritize relevant information over irrelevant data points.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Contextual Understanding and Question Intent Analysis**. All other improvements are contingent upon addressing this fundamental weakness. The system must better interpret the question and map it to the relevant parts of the provided text.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Question Decomposition Strategy:** Break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions. This allows the system to focus on specific aspects of the question and extract relevant information more effectively. For example, the \"duration\" question should be decomposed into \"find the start date\" and \"find the end date\" before attempting to calculate the difference.\n\n2.  **Develop a Context-Aware Information Selection Module:** Instead of relying solely on keyword matching, implement a module that considers the context of the question and passage when selecting relevant information. This could involve techniques like semantic similarity scoring, dependency parsing, or knowledge graph integration. Specifically:\n    *   **Semantic Similarity Scoring:** Calculate the semantic similarity between the question and different sentences or phrases in the passage. Prioritize information from sentences with high similarity scores.\n    *   **Dependency Parsing:** Use dependency parsing to identify the relationships between words in the question and passage. This can help to determine which entities and concepts are most relevant to the question.\n\n3.  **Enhance Error Feedback Mechanism:** For each incorrect answer, provide detailed feedback on *why* the answer was wrong and *how* the system arrived at that answer. This will help the system learn from its mistakes and improve its accuracy over time. Use the identified error patterns to create targeted training examples that address specific weaknesses.\n\n4.  **Implement a Rule-Based System for Numerical Unit Handling:** Create a rule-based system that understands different units of measurement (e.g., years, months, days) and can convert between them if necessary. This will help to ensure that the system is performing calculations on compatible units.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but with significant room for improvement**. While the system demonstrates some proficiency in basic tasks, its lack of contextual understanding prevents it from consistently delivering accurate results. Addressing the identified weaknesses is critical for unlocking the system's full potential and achieving meaningful performance gains.\n"

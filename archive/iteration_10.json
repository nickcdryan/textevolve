It decomposes the problem into extraction and generation steps, leveraging LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. The functions `extract_meeting_data`, `extract_availabilities`, and `find_free_slots` act as specialized agents extracting scheduling information and proposing meeting times, orchestrated by `main`. The `call_llm` function calls the Gemini model and the `json.loads` function parses the information.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nAll 5 error cases show the same error: \"Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This indicates a `JSONDecodeError`. This error occurs when the system is trying to parse a JSON string, but the string is either empty or contains invalid JSON. Given that it appears in all cases, it suggests a fundamental problem in how the system's output is formatted before being parsed as JSON, or that the LLM is consistently failing to produce any JSON output at all.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   The problem descriptions are clear and well-formatted.\n*   The task is well-defined with clear constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **JSON Output Generation:** The system consistently fails to produce valid JSON output, leading to parsing errors.\n*   **Error Handling:** The system provides a generic error message, but lacks specific details about why the JSON parsing failed. This makes debugging difficult.\n*   **Robustness:** The system is not robust enough to handle various input scenarios and consistently produces the same error.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **LLM's JSON Output:** The most critical bottleneck is the LLM's ability to consistently generate valid JSON output.\n*   **JSON Parsing:** The JSON parsing component either doesn't receive any value from the LLM, or the format that it is receiving is not valid.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring error pattern is a `JSONDecodeError`. This indicates that the LLM is likely failing to follow instructions to output a structured JSON, or there is a problem in the parsing or post-processing of LLM output.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the inconsistent generation of valid JSON by the LLM. This results in a `JSONDecodeError`, preventing the system from correctly extracting information and generating solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **LLM Prompting:** Improve the prompt to ensure the LLM is explicitly instructed to output data in valid JSON format. Provide clear examples and formatting guidelines.\n*   **Output Validation:** Add a validation step to check if the LLM's output is valid JSON *before* attempting to parse it. If not, implement a retry mechanism with feedback to the LLM.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement more specific error handling for JSON parsing failures. Log the raw LLM output and provide more informative error messages to assist in debugging.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Revise the Prompt:**\n    *   Add explicit instructions for JSON formatting within the prompt.\n    *   Include example JSON outputs with clear field names and data types.\n    *   Specify that the LLM should *only* output JSON, with no surrounding text or explanations.\n\n2.  **Implement Output Validation and Retry:**\n    ```python\n    import json\n    def call_llm_with_retry(prompt, max_attempts=3):\n        for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n            llm_output = call_llm(prompt)\n            try:\n                data = json.loads(llm_output)\n                return data\n            except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n                print(f\"LLM Output: {llm_output}\") # Log the raw output\n                # Provide feedback to the LLM to correct the JSON format\n                prompt = prompt + f\"\\n\\nERROR: Invalid JSON.

      "text_report": "Okay, I will provide a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and improvement suggestions.\n\n```\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs clearly show a consistent and fatal error: \"Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This `JSONDecodeError` occurs in every sample, confirming the initial diagnosis of a systematic problem with JSON output. The LLM is either returning an empty string, plain text (instead of JSON), or malformed JSON that the `json.loads()` function cannot parse. This complete failure to produce valid JSON renders the system entirely non-functional. There's no useful information to extract or any further analysis to be done on the outputs themselves, as they are all error messages.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the system has **zero** demonstrated capabilities. It consistently fails to execute the core task of generating structured JSON output. This failure cascades, preventing all subsequent processing steps. The system is effectively non-functional in its current state.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the information available, the **only** identified strength is the clarity and formatting of the problem descriptions and the well-defined task with clear constraints. However, this strength is rendered irrelevant by the system's inability to process the input and produce a valid output.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\nThe key weaknesses are:\n\n*   **Complete Failure of JSON Generation:** The LLM is unable to reliably generate valid JSON. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** The system is completely inflexible and fails catastrophically with even minor variations in input or operating conditions, consistently producing the same error.\n*   **Insufficient Error Handling:** While *a* error is reported, it doesn't provide enough context to debug effectively. The raw LLM output is missing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Reliable JSON Output Generation**. Without this, the entire system is unusable.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThese are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, prioritized by impact:\n\n1.  **Implement call\\_llm\\_with\\_retry**: This will improve the LLM's ability to produce valid JSON using multiple attempts and error feedback.\n    ```python\n    import json\n\n    def call_llm_with_retry(prompt, system_instruction, max_attempts=3):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calls the LLM with a retry mechanism to ensure valid JSON output.\n        Includes system instruction for better guidance.\n        \"\"\"\n        for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n            llm_output = call_llm(prompt, system_instruction)  # Include system instruction\n            try:\n                data = json.loads(llm_output)\n                return data\n            except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                print(f\"Attempt {attempt+1}: JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n                print(f\"LLM Output: {llm_output}\")  # Log the raw output\n                # Provide feedback to the LLM to correct the JSON format\n                prompt = prompt + f\"\\n\\nERROR: Invalid JSON. Please ensure your output is valid JSON. Use the exact format as shown in the examples. Error details: {e}\"\n        print(\"Max retries exceeded. Returning None.\")\n        return None  # Or return a default JSON structure\n\n    # Example Usage (replace with your specific system_instruction):\n    system_instruction = \"You are an expert JSON generator. Your output MUST be valid JSON.\"\n    data = call_llm_with_retry(your_prompt, system_instruction)\n    if data:\n        # Process the JSON data\n        pass\n    else:\n        # Handle the error case\n        pass\n    ```\n2.  **Revise Prompts with System Instructions**: Enforce that the LLM always produce valid JSON.\n    *   **Add explicit system instructions**: Include a clear system instruction for the LLM to *only* output JSON, and that the output *must* be valid JSON.\n    *   **Elaborate on JSON formatting**: Provide more detailed instructions on JSON formatting within the prompt, specifying field names, data types, and expected structure.\n    *   **Example Outputs**: Provide clear and complete example JSON outputs, demonstrating the expected format.\n    *   **Constraint**:  Add the statement \"**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any surrounding text, explanations, or conversational elements.**\" to the end of the prompt.\n\n3.  **Implement Pre-Parsing Validation (Optional, but Recommended)**:  Before attempting `json.loads()`, add a check to see if the LLM output *looks* like JSON (starts with `{`, ends with `}`, contains a colon, etc.). This can help catch cases where the LLM returns plain text. This is a quick check to avoid calling `json.loads()` on non-JSON.\n\n4.  **Improve Error Logging**: Log the raw LLM output **always**, not just when a JSON error occurs. Include timestamps and the complete prompt used for each call to the LLM. This is critical for debugging.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable (Zero)**. The system consistently fails, and there is no evidence of improvement.\n\nBy implementing the actionable recommendations, the next iteration should focus on establishing a baseline of reliable JSON output. Only then can further capabilities be assessed and improved.\n```",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nAll 5 error cases show the same error: \"Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This indicates a `JSONDecodeError`. This error occurs when the system is trying to parse a JSON string, but the string is either empty or contains invalid JSON. Given that it appears in all cases, it suggests a fundamental problem in how the system's output is formatted before being parsed as JSON, or that the LLM is consistently failing to produce any JSON output at all.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   The problem descriptions are clear and well-formatted.\n*   The task is well-defined with clear constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **JSON Output Generation:** The system consistently fails to produce valid JSON output, leading to parsing errors.\n*   **Error Handling:** The system provides a generic error message, but lacks specific details about why the JSON parsing failed. This makes debugging difficult.\n*   **Robustness:** The system is not robust enough to handle various input scenarios and consistently produces the same error.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **LLM's JSON Output:** The most critical bottleneck is the LLM's ability to consistently generate valid JSON output.\n*   **JSON Parsing:** The JSON parsing component either doesn't receive any value from the LLM, or the format that it is receiving is not valid.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring error pattern is a `JSONDecodeError`. This indicates that the LLM is likely failing to follow instructions to output a structured JSON, or there is a problem in the parsing or post-processing of LLM output.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the inconsistent generation of valid JSON by the LLM. This results in a `JSONDecodeError`, preventing the system from correctly extracting information and generating solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **LLM Prompting:** Improve the prompt to ensure the LLM is explicitly instructed to output data in valid JSON format. Provide clear examples and formatting guidelines.\n*   **Output Validation:** Add a validation step to check if the LLM's output is valid JSON *before* attempting to parse it. If not, implement a retry mechanism with feedback to the LLM.\n*   **Error Handling:** Implement more specific error handling for JSON parsing failures. Log the raw LLM output and provide more informative error messages to assist in debugging.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Revise the Prompt:**\n    *   Add explicit instructions for JSON formatting within the prompt.\n    *   Include example JSON outputs with clear field names and data types.\n    *   Specify that the LLM should *only* output JSON, with no surrounding text or explanations.\n\n2.  **Implement Output Validation and Retry:**\n    ```python\n    import json\n    def call_llm_with_retry(prompt, max_attempts=3):\n        for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n            llm_output = call_llm(prompt)\n            try:\n                data = json.loads(llm_output)\n                return data\n            except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n                print(f\"LLM Output: {llm_output}\") # Log the raw output\n                # Provide feedback to the LLM to correct the JSON format\n                prompt = prompt + f\"\\n\\nERROR: Invalid JSON. Please ensure your output is valid JSON. Error details: {e}\"\n        print(\"Max retries exceeded. Returning None.\")\n        return None # Or return a default JSON structure\n\n    # Example usage:\n    data = call_llm_with_retry(your_prompt)\n    if data:\n        # Process the JSON data\n        pass\n    else:\n        # Handle the error case\n        pass\n    ```\n\n3.  **Improve Error Logging:**\n    *   Log the raw LLM output whenever a `JSONDecodeError` occurs.\n    *   Include the error message from the `json.loads()` function in the log.\n    *   Add timestamps to the logs for easier debugging.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, I will provide a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and improvement suggestions.\n\n```\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs clearly show a consistent and fatal error: \"Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This `JSONDecodeError` occurs in every sample, confirming the initial diagnosis of a systematic problem with JSON output. The LLM is either returning an empty string, plain text (instead of JSON), or malformed JSON that the `json.loads()` function cannot parse. This complete failure to produce valid JSON renders the system entirely non-functional. There's no useful information to extract or any further analysis to be done on the outputs themselves, as they are all error messages.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the system has **zero** demonstrated capabilities. It consistently fails to execute the core task of generating structured JSON output. This failure cascades, preventing all subsequent processing steps. The system is effectively non-functional in its current state.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the information available, the **only** identified strength is the clarity and formatting of the problem descriptions and the well-defined task with clear constraints. However, this strength is rendered irrelevant by the system's inability to process the input and produce a valid output.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\nThe key weaknesses are:\n\n*   **Complete Failure of JSON Generation:** The LLM is unable to reliably generate valid JSON. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** The system is completely inflexible and fails catastrophically with even minor variations in input or operating conditions, consistently producing the same error.\n*   **Insufficient Error Handling:** While *a* error is reported, it doesn't provide enough context to debug effectively. The raw LLM output is missing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Reliable JSON Output Generation**. Without this, the entire system is unusable.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThese are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, prioritized by impact:\n\n1.  **Implement call\\_llm\\_with\\_retry**: This will improve the LLM's ability to produce valid JSON using multiple attempts and error feedback.\n    ```python\n    import json\n\n    def call_llm_with_retry(prompt, system_instruction, max_attempts=3):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calls the LLM with a retry mechanism to ensure valid JSON output.\n        Includes system instruction for better guidance.\n        \"\"\"\n        for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n            llm_output = call_llm(prompt, system_instruction)  # Include system instruction\n            try:\n                data = json.loads(llm_output)\n                return data\n            except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                print(f\"Attempt {attempt+1}: JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n                print(f\"LLM Output: {llm_output}\")  # Log the raw output\n                # Provide feedback to the LLM to correct the JSON format\n                prompt = prompt + f\"\\n\\nERROR: Invalid JSON. Please ensure your output is valid JSON. Use the exact format as shown in the examples. Error details: {e}\"\n        print(\"Max retries exceeded. Returning None.\")\n        return None  # Or return a default JSON structure\n\n    # Example Usage (replace with your specific system_instruction):\n    system_instruction = \"You are an expert JSON generator. Your output MUST be valid JSON.\"\n    data = call_llm_with_retry(your_prompt, system_instruction)\n    if data:\n        # Process the JSON data\n        pass\n    else:\n        # Handle the error case\n        pass\n    ```\n2.  **Revise Prompts with System Instructions**: Enforce that the LLM always produce valid JSON.\n    *   **Add explicit system instructions**: Include a clear system instruction for the LLM to *only* output JSON, and that the output *must* be valid JSON.\n    *   **Elaborate on JSON formatting**: Provide more detailed instructions on JSON formatting within the prompt, specifying field names, data types, and expected structure.\n    *   **Example Outputs**: Provide clear and complete example JSON outputs, demonstrating the expected format.\n    *   **Constraint**:  Add the statement \"**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any surrounding text, explanations, or conversational elements.**\" to the end of the prompt.\n\n3.  **Implement Pre-Parsing Validation (Optional, but Recommended)**:  Before attempting `json.loads()`, add a check to see if the LLM output *looks* like JSON (starts with `{`, ends with `}`, contains a colon, etc.). This can help catch cases where the LLM returns plain text. This is a quick check to avoid calling `json.loads()` on non-JSON.\n\n4.  **Improve Error Logging**: Log the raw LLM output **always**, not just when a JSON error occurs. Include timestamps and the complete prompt used for each call to the LLM. This is critical for debugging.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable (Zero)**. The system consistently fails, and there is no evidence of improvement.\n\nBy implementing the actionable recommendations, the next iteration should focus on establishing a baseline of reliable JSON output. Only then can further capabilities be assessed and improved.\n```"

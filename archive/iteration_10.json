  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to solve grid transformation problems by decomposing the task into rule extraction, transformation application, and result validation. Each stage utilizes a dedicated LLM agent with a specific system instruction and prompt. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `extract_rule_and_dimensions` to get the rule and dimensions, `apply_transformation_with_dimensions` to transform the grid, and `validate_transformation` to check the result, with each function calling `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves sequentially extracting information, applying transformations based on the extracted information, and then validating the result, leveraging example-based prompting to guide the LLM.",

Accuracy is 0.00 (0/3). The system consistently fails to correctly identify and apply the intended grid transformation logic.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output is a list of matrices instead of a single matrix as would be expected. This shows a failure to follow the expected format. The content of the matrices also appears to have little or no correlation to a logical transformation of the input grid. It appears random.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** Similar to Sample ID 0, the output matrix generated is completely illogical and doesn't represent any reasonable transformation rule from the training examples (which are not provided).\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system attempts to explain the rule and then generates code. While the reasoning structure is present, the interpretation of the rule is incorrect. It focuses on the existence of rows with only 0s, 1s, 2s, or a mix, but fails to implement this logic in the code. The code only checks for one occurence of the respective row types in the whole grid, as opposed to generating an array of occurences.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system's current capabilities are severely limited. While it demonstrates a basic understanding of code generation and reasoning structure, its core functionality of pattern recognition, abstraction, and generalization is non-existent. It struggles with understanding the underlying transformation rules and applying them correctly to unseen data.  The formatting of the output is also inconsistent.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Reasoning Structure (Marginal):** The attempt to break down the problem is a positive starting point, even though the reasoning is currently flawed.\n*   **Code Generation (Basic):** The system *can* generate Python code, but the generated code is often based on an incorrect understanding of the problem and contains logical errors.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Critical):** The system *cannot* identify the patterns or transformation logic from the input data. This is the most significant failing.\n*   **Abstraction and Generalization (Critical):**  It's unable to generalize from training examples to new inputs.\n*   **Solution Verification (Missing):** There's no evidence of any self-checking or verification mechanism to ensure the generated solution aligns with the training data or logical constraints.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system sometimes fails to output answers in the correct format.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **PATTERN RECOGNITION**. If the system cannot identify the patterns, all other capabilities are rendered useless. This improvement should focus on both recognizing patterns, as well as generating the correct output, based on the identified pattern.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement CNNs/Attention Mechanisms:** Incorporate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or attention mechanisms into the model architecture to improve spatial pattern recognition. Start with simpler CNN architectures and gradually increase complexity.\n2.  **Diversify Training Data and Curriculum Learning:**  Expand the training dataset with a wider variety of grid transformations. Implement curriculum learning where the system is first exposed to simpler transformations and then gradually introduced to more complex ones.\n3.  **Implement Solution Verification:** Add a module that tests the generated solution against training examples or a set of predefined rules to ensure consistency and correctness. This could involve comparing the output of the generated transformation on the training input with the training output. The model should only generate final solutions if the validation is successful.\n4.  **Introduce Debugging Tools:** Implement logging and debugging features to track the intermediate steps of the reasoning process. This will allow developers to pinpoint exactly where the system is going wrong.\n5.  **Output Type Enforcement:**  Explicitly enforce the correct output format (single matrix) in the output generation step. Implement a check *before* returning the result to ensure it conforms to the expected structure.\n6. **Check Reasoning Logic:** Add unit tests for functions/modules within the system that involve reasoning logic. This will help ensure that the functions return the expected result given a specific input.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **DECLINING**. The system demonstrates limited functionality and fails to perform its intended task. Without significant changes, performance is unlikely to improve.\n",

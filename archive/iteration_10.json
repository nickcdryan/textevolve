It decomposes the problem into identifying, verifying, and applying transformation logic. The LLM acts as a \"grid transformation expert\" in each step.\n\nThe functions `identify_core_transformation_logic`, `verify_transformation_logic`, and `apply_transformation_to_test_input` each use `call_llm` to interact with the LLM, generating a transformation rule, verifying it, and applying it, respectively. `main` orchestrates these calls sequentially, returning an error if verification fails, or the transformed grid if successful.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and execution outputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThe system demonstrates a limited capability in solving grid transformation problems. While it can generate Python code and includes a verification step, the core logic is flawed, and efficiency issues lead to timeouts. The system fails to accurately deduce the transformation logic from training examples. Its accuracy is currently at 0%, indicating a significant need for improvement. The inclusion of a \"Verification successful\" message even when results are incorrect suggests a critical flaw in the verification logic.\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (Timeout):** The \"Script execution timed out\" error indicates a severe performance bottleneck. The generated code, while syntactically correct and logically coherent, likely has a high time complexity, making it unable to handle larger grid sizes within the allowed time. It is also possible that the underlying algorithm never finishes, thus timing out. The algorithm attempts to find diagonal paths, which, in the worst case, can involve iterating through the entire grid for each non-zero element.\n*   **Sample ID 1 (Incorrect Logic):** The generated code attempts to count consecutive 1s or 2s in each row and output the first 5 counts. However, based on the prompt, this logic appears completely misaligned with any typical grid transformation task. Furthermore, the `Verification successful` message before the answer is misleading, indicating a severe flaw in the verification process.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can generate Python code from the given prompt, which is a fundamental requirement for the task.\n*   **Attempt at Verification:** The presence of a verification step, even if currently flawed, is a positive aspect, showing an intention to validate the solution before providing it. It indicates a framework for a self-improving system.\n*   **Understanding of basic programming constructs:** The python that is generated is syntactically valid and generally easy to understand.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Algorithm Correctness:** The system fundamentally fails to devise correct algorithms for grid transformations.\n*   **Time Complexity:** The generated algorithms are inefficient and prone to timeouts.\n*   **Flawed Verification Logic:** The verification step is not reliable, providing false positives, and therefore provides no value to the end-user.\n*   **Lack of Adaptability:** The system seems to get stuck on particular methods and fails to effectively adjust to the constraints of the problem.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Algorithm Correctness**. Addressing this will have the most significant impact on overall performance. Improving this should include improvements to Pattern Recognition.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Revamp Pattern Recognition Module:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement a new pattern recognition module using CNNs or transformers. Train this module on a larger dataset of grid transformation examples. Fine-tune the model specifically for spatial relationship recognition and pattern extrapolation.\n    *   **Rationale:** CNNs excel at identifying spatial patterns in images/grids, and transformers can capture long-range dependencies between elements.\n\n2.  **Re-evaluate Solution Verification Module:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement or significantly revise the solution verification module. Ensure that it verifies the correctness of the transformed grid against the input grid and the training examples.\n    *   **Rationale:** The verification module must be reliable to prevent the system from outputting incorrect solutions with a \"Verification successful\" message.\n    *   **Sub-actions:**\n        *   Add explicit test cases derived from the training examples in the verification module.\n        *   Implement a more rigorous check, possibly involving comparing the generated output to the expected output using a similarity metric.\n\n3.  **Implement Algorithm Design Exploration:**\n    *   **Action:** Integrate a mechanism to explore different algorithmic approaches. For instance, if the CNN approach is not successful within a few iterations, switch to a rule-based system that tries to deduce transformations from simple pattern matching.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will allow the system to adapt to the complexity of the problem and explore alternative solutions.\n\n4.  **Introduce Incremental Debugging:**\n    *   **Action:** Add print statements to the generated code during debugging to track the intermediate states and calculations.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will provide more information on how the algorithm is performing at each step.\n    *   **Sub-actions:**\n        *   Provide intermediate grid states.\n        *   Log the extracted patterns and rules at each step of the transformation.\n\n5.  **Implement Time Complexity Analysis and Optimization:**\n    *   **Action:** Before executing the code, perform a basic time complexity analysis. If the predicted complexity is high (e.g., O(n^3)), attempt to optimize the algorithm or switch to a more efficient approach.\n    *   **Rationale:** This can help prevent timeouts and improve the system's ability to handle larger grids.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable at a very low level** (0% accuracy). To determine if the capabilities are improving, declining, or stable, track accuracy on a held-out test set after implementing the above recommendations. Significant improvement in accuracy would indicate a positive trend.\n",

Fine-tune the model specifically for spatial relationship recognition and pattern extrapolation.\n    *   **Rationale:** CNNs excel at identifying spatial patterns in images/grids, and transformers can capture long-range dependencies between elements.\n\n2.  **Re-evaluate Solution Verification Module:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement or significantly revise the solution verification module. Ensure that it verifies the correctness of the transformed grid against the input grid and the training examples.\n    *   **Rationale:** The verification module must be reliable to prevent the system from outputting incorrect solutions with a \"Verification successful\" message.\n    *   **Sub-actions:**\n        *   Add explicit test cases derived from the training examples in the verification module.\n        *   Implement a more rigorous check, possibly involving comparing the generated output to the expected output using a similarity metric.\n\n3.  **Implement Algorithm Design Exploration:**\n    *   **Action:** Integrate a mechanism to explore different algorithmic approaches. For instance, if the CNN approach is not successful within a few iterations, switch to a rule-based system that tries to deduce transformations from simple pattern matching.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will allow the system to adapt to the complexity of the problem and explore alternative solutions.\n\n4.  **Introduce Incremental Debugging:**\n    *   **Action:** Add print statements to the generated code during debugging to track the intermediate states and calculations.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will provide more information on how the algorithm is performing at each step.\n    *   **Sub-actions:**\n        *   Provide intermediate grid states.\n        *   Log the extracted patterns and rules at each step of the transformation.\n\n5.  **Implement Time Complexity Analysis and Optimization:**\n    *   **Action:** Before executing the code, perform a basic time complexity analysis. If the predicted complexity is high (e.g., O(n^3)), attempt to optimize the algorithm or switch to a more efficient approach.\n    *   **Rationale:** This can help prevent timeouts and improve the system's ability to handle larger grids.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable at a very low level** (0% accuracy). To determine if the capabilities are improving, declining, or stable, track accuracy on a held-out test set after implementing the above recommendations. Significant improvement in accuracy would indicate a positive trend.\n"

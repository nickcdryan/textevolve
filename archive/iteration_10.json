  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to schedule meetings by analyzing the problem, generating candidate solutions with reasoning, selecting the best solution, and verifying the proposed time. The problem is decomposed into distinct stages handled sequentially, each using a specific prompt and system instruction to guide the LLM's behavior. Functions like `analyze_problem` extracts constraints, `generate_candidate_solutions` creates possible times, `select_best_solution` chooses an optimal time, and `verify_proposed_time` validates the format; all rely on `call_llm` to interface with the LLM. The overall workflow involves sequentially calling these functions, with each step refining the information until a verified solution is obtained.",

It states everyone is free at 11:30 but doesn't detail how it arrived at that conclusion based on individual schedules.\n- The system fails to identify the correct meeting time (15:30 - 16:00) as given in the golden answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Schedule Parsing and Availability Calculation:** The system struggles to accurately parse the busy schedules and determine available time slots for *all* participants. It seems to either misinterpret the schedules or makes incorrect deductions about availability.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- **Incorrect Time Slot Selection:** The most apparent error pattern is the selection of an incorrect time slot. This suggests a problem with the core logic that determines free time based on individual schedules.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is an inaccurate calculation of available time slots, leading to the selection of an incorrect meeting time. The system claims everyone is free at 11:30, which contradicts the schedules provided (e.g., Billy is busy until 11:00, and Peter is busy until 10:30 and again from 11:00 to 13:00). The system is likely missing a check that iterates through each participant's constraints before generating the candidate schedule.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Information Extraction:** Although no explicit extraction errors are shown, improve robustness and add error checking to the schedule parsing logic. Ensure all time intervals are correctly interpreted.\n- **Constraint Handling:** Significantly enhance the constraint handling to ensure ALL schedules are considered when determining if a proposed meeting time works for everyone. The current implementation appears to have flaws in its logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a function for schedule parsing:** Create a function that explicitly parses the schedule for each person into a standardized data structure (e.g., a list of tuples representing busy intervals).\n2. **Implement a function to determine available slots:** Create a function that, given a set of schedules and a meeting duration, calculates all possible available time slots within the specified work hours. This function should iterate through the entire workday in the provided problem.\n3. **Implement constraint verification with early exit:** Before suggesting a solution, verify that each individual participant is free during the proposed time. Implement an \"early exit\" check; if any single person is unavailable, the system should immediately reject that time slot and consider another.\n4. **Improve the output formatting.** The system should output all candidate schedules before printing the best solution.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample ID: 0**\n    - information_extraction: Potentially needs improvement in robustly extracting time ranges.\n    - constraint_handling: FAILED.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to transform a grid based on training examples. It decomposes the problem into extracting data, generating a transformation rule, applying the rule, and verifying the output format. Two agent roles are involved: a rule generator and a grid transformer, both using the `call_llm` function to interact with the LLM. The functions used include: `main` which orchestrates the process, `preprocess_question` which extracts training examples and test input, `generate_transformation_rule` which generates a transformation rule, `apply_transformation_rule` which applies the rule, `verify_grid_format` which checks the format, `post_process_grid` which corrects the format, and `call_llm` which calls the LLM. The overall workflow involves extracting the data, creating a transformation rule, applying it, and returning the result while verifying the output's integrity.",

The errors are logical errors, where the generated code doesn't produce the expected output based on the training examples.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Code Generation:** The system successfully generates executable code based on the problem description and training examples.\n2.  **Pattern Recognition (Limited):** The system attempts to identify patterns in the training data and apply them to the test input.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Inaccurate Pattern Generalization:** The system struggles to correctly generalize the patterns observed in the training examples to the test input. The code generated doesn't accurately reflect the transformation logic present in the examples.\n2.  **Inability to Infer Dimensionality Changes:** In sample_id 0 and 2, there is dimensionality reduction from input to output grid. This is not correctly captured.\n3.  **Incorrect Code Execution:** The generated code is syntactically correct but logically flawed, leading to incorrect output. The system does not have any means to test or debug the code that it has created, meaning that logical errors will persist.\n4.  **Literal Code Reproduction:** The system includes the code in its output which leads to the true answer not being conveyed.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Pattern Generalization and Logical Reasoning:** The system's primary bottleneck is its inability to accurately generalize patterns from the training examples and translate those patterns into correct, executable code.\n2.  **Lack of Solution Verification:** The absence of a solution verification step prevents the system from identifying and correcting errors in its generated code.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Incorrect Transformations:** In all error cases, the output grid generated by the system does not match the expected transformation based on the training examples.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Spatial Relationships:** The system struggles to understand the spatial relationships and transformations within the grids. It fails to correctly map elements from the input grid to the output grid.\n3.  **Inconsistent Pattern Application:** The system applies the patterns inconsistently, leading to variations in the output that do not align with the training data.\n4.  **Code generation included in the answer**: In sample_id 0, the system answer contains the code and not just the answer.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inadequate ability to generalize patterns and translate them into logically correct and executable code. This issue stems from a combination of limited reasoning capabilities and a lack of solution verification mechanisms. It is also an issue the code is not validated as being executable and delivering a valid answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Enhanced Pattern Generalization:** The system needs a more robust mechanism for identifying and generalizing patterns from the training examples. This could involve using more sophisticated machine learning techniques or incorporating rule-based reasoning.\n2.  **Code Debugging/Testing:** The system needs an automated way to test and debug the generated code to ensure that it is logically correct and produces the desired output.\n3.  **Contextual Understanding:** Improve the system's understanding of the context and spatial relationships within the grids. This could involve incorporating techniques from computer vision or spatial reasoning.\n4.  **Output Formatting:** The system's outputs should be correctly formatted, and only include the expected answer, not code.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a Code Execution and Testing Module:** Integrate a code execution module that runs the generated code and provides feedback on its output. This module should include unit tests based on the training examples to verify the correctness of the code.\n2.  **Incorporate Spatial Reasoning Techniques:** Explore methods for incorporating spatial reasoning techniques to improve the system's understanding of the grids and their transformations.\n3.  **Refine Pattern Extraction Algorithm:** Refine the pattern extraction algorithm to identify more subtle patterns and relationships in the training data. Consider using techniques like sequence alignment or graph matching.\n4.  **Utilize a More Robust Machine Learning Model:** Explore the use of more advanced machine learning models that are better suited for pattern recognition and generalization.\n5.  **Add Output Formatting**: Change the output of the model so that the answer is only presented, and not the code generation process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partial Success\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failure\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failure\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failure\n    *   decision\\_making: Failure\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partial Success\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failure\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failure\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failure\n    *   decision\\_making: Failure\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partial Success\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failure\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failure\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failure\n    *   decision\\_making: Failure\n",

This is a formatting error and obscures the actual answer. The generated code attempts to apply transformations based on the largest value in the input, but the logic for determining which cells to transform and how (based on adjacent cells) is flawed.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The output is contained in a code block with markdown formatting. The grid itself also contains these formatting backticks.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The output grid `[[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]]` is incorrect based on the problem description and training data. The output is a 1x5 matrix, indicating that it has correctly captured the dimensionality change.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a very limited capability to solve the given tasks. While it can generate code and partially extract information from the problem description, it fails to generalize patterns effectively and lacks robust solution verification. The inclusion of code in the output and formatting errors further reduces its usability. Overall, the system exhibits a rudimentary understanding of the problem but fails to deliver accurate and usable solutions.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can produce syntactically correct code.\n*   **Partial Information Extraction:** It can extract some information from the problem description and training data.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** Struggles to correctly generalize patterns from training examples to test inputs.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Lacks any mechanism to verify or correct its generated solutions.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Outputs include code, markdown formatting, and other extraneous information instead of just the answer.\n*   **Inaccurate Transformations**: Fails to apply accurate transformations.\n*   **Logical Reasoning:** Limited logical reasoning capability hinders accurate code generation.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. If the system cannot accurately generalize from training data, no other improvements will be effective. Solution verification should be a close second priority.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Code Execution and Testing:**\n    *   Integrate a code execution engine to run the generated code and capture the output *programmatically* (not just by printing strings).\n    *   Create a suite of unit tests based on the training examples to verify the correctness of the generated code.\n    *   Implement a feedback loop: if the code fails the tests, attempt to modify and regenerate it (perhaps through iterative refinement or by trying different code generation strategies).\n2.  **Focus on Spatial Relationship Modeling:**\n    *   Explore techniques for explicitly modeling spatial relationships between elements in the grids (e.g., convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, or rule-based systems).\n    *   Train the model on a larger dataset with more diverse transformations.\n3.  **Refactor Pattern Extraction:**\n    *   Review the current pattern extraction algorithm. It is not working.\n    *   Explore more sophisticated pattern extraction techniques, such as sequence alignment, graph matching, or constraint satisfaction solvers.\n4.  **Implement Post-Processing for Output Formatting:**\n    *   *Strictly* enforce a post-processing step to extract the final answer from the code output. Ensure that only the final result is returned and that it adheres to the expected format (e.g., just the grid, without code, markdown, or \"ANSWER_START/END\" tags).\n    *   Remove any backticks and other formatting from the final answer.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided performance summary and error analysis, the system's capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. Without significant improvements in pattern generalization and solution verification, the system will remain ineffective. The suggested actionable recommendations are essential for driving improvement.\n",

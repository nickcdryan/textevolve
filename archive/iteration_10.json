  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using a two-step LLM approach: first, `analyze_visual_features` analyzes the problem and generates a transformation description, which is then validated to ensure it's usable, and second, `apply_transformation` applies the described transformation to produce the output grid. The script uses chain-of-thought prompting with multi-example prompts to guide the LLM. Two agents are implicitly defined via system instructions: a visual feature analyzer and a transformation applier. The functions `solve_grid_transformation`, `analyze_visual_features`, `apply_transformation`, and `call_llm` are used sequentially to breakdown the grid problem, use an LLM to solve the problem, and return the solution. The overall workflow involves analyzing visual features, validating the analysis, applying the transformation based on the analysis, and returning the final transformed grid.",

However, it uses the *input* grid's dimensions to calculate the subgrid sizes, which is incorrect.  The execution demonstrates the system's misunderstanding of how to derive the output dimensions and correctly map the input grid information to the output grid.  The code itself is syntactically correct and runnable, but semantically flawed.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The code creates a copy of the original grid, and attempts to cascade the original values diagonally downwards and to the left if a value is non-zero. This approach makes more sense than the prior one, and has the advantage of not shrinking the original grid size.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The generated code produces a very short array that bears no resemblance to the problem specification.  The reason for this is unclear, but the code generated demonstrates a failure to extract the problem requirements from the input.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a *limited* capability in solving grid transformation problems.  It can generate runnable code and exhibits some understanding of grid manipulations (finding maximums, copying). However, it *fails* at generalizing patterns from training examples to new inputs, accurately determining output dimensions, and ensuring the generated code aligns with the problem's constraints. The accuracy of 33% reflects this limited success.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** Ability to generate syntactically correct Python code.\n*   **Basic Grid Operations:**  Understanding of fundamental grid manipulations like finding maximums and copying.\n*   **Adaptability:** The system can respond to instructions to solve the grid generation task.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:**  Struggles to apply learned transformations to unseen data. This is the most significant bottleneck.\n*   **Output Dimension Determination:**  Fails to correctly infer the required dimensions of the output grid.\n*   **Problem Understanding:** Has difficulty extracting the proper constraints for grid transformation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to improve is **Pattern Generalization**.  Without this, the system cannot reliably solve new grid transformation problems, regardless of its ability to generate code or perform basic grid operations.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Feature-Based Approach:** Instead of directly trying to divide the grids into subgrids, change the model to focus on more general features. Examples include counting the number of unique elements, the number of rows that each element appears in, or specific locations of the elements.\n2.  **Augment Training Data:** Increase the diversity of training examples, specifically focusing on variations in grid sizes and transformation patterns. Include examples with different output dimensions.\n3.  **Implement a Solution Verification Mechanism**: Add a mechanism for the system to evaluate its generated solutions based on the input training examples. This could involve comparing the generated output with the expected output for the training examples.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, given the low accuracy and the critical weaknesses identified, the system is currently operating at a **stable** level with significant room for improvement. After the actionable recommendations are implemented, the trend can be accurately assessed.\n",

However, it uses the *input* grid's dimensions to calculate the subgrid sizes, which is incorrect.  The execution demonstrates the system's misunderstanding of how to derive the output dimensions and correctly map the input grid information to the output grid.  The code itself is syntactically correct and runnable, but semantically flawed.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The code creates a copy of the original grid, and attempts to cascade the original values diagonally downwards and to the left if a value is non-zero. This approach makes more sense than the prior one, and has the advantage of not shrinking the original grid size.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The generated code produces a very short array that bears no resemblance to the problem specification.  The reason for this is unclear, but the code generated demonstrates a failure to extract the problem requirements from the input.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a *limited* capability in solving grid transformation problems.  It can generate runnable code and exhibits some understanding of grid manipulations (finding maximums, copying). However, it *fails* at generalizing patterns from training examples to new inputs, accurately determining output dimensions, and ensuring the generated code aligns with the problem's constraints. The accuracy of 33% reflects this limited success.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** Ability to generate syntactically correct Python code.\n*   **Basic Grid Operations:**  Understanding of fundamental grid manipulations like finding maximums and copying.\n*   **Adaptability:** The system can respond to instructions to solve the grid generation task.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:**  Struggles to apply learned transformations to unseen data. This is the most significant bottleneck.\n*   **Output Dimension Determination:**  Fails to correctly infer the required dimensions of the output grid.\n*   **Problem Understanding:** Has difficulty extracting the proper constraints for grid transformation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to improve is **Pattern Generalization**.  Without this, the system cannot reliably solve new grid transformation problems, regardless of its ability to generate code or perform basic grid operations.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Feature-Based Approach:** Instead of directly trying to divide the grids into subgrids, change the model to focus on more general features. Examples include counting the number of unique elements, the number of rows that each element appears in, or specific locations of the elements.\n2.  **Augment Training Data:** Increase the diversity of training examples, specifically focusing on variations in grid sizes and transformation patterns. Include examples with different output dimensions.\n3.  **Implement a Solution Verification Mechanism**: Add a mechanism for the system to evaluate its generated solutions based on the input training examples. This could involve comparing the generated output with the expected output for the training examples.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, given the low accuracy and the critical weaknesses identified, the system is currently operating at a **stable** level with significant room for improvement. After the actionable recommendations are implemented, the trend can be accurately assessed.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script implements a concept expansion and evidence ranking approach to answer factual questions using the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into concept expansion, simulated information retrieval, evidence ranking, answer extraction, and validation steps, each handled by the LLM acting as a specific agent (concept expander, search engine simulator, evidence ranker, answer extractor, and validator). The `call_llm` function is central, used to interact with the Gemini model with a prompt and system instruction. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow: it first expands the key concepts from the initial question using `call_llm`, then it simulates search results, ranks evidence, extracts the answer, and validates the final result.",

The system is failing to link the expanded concepts to specific knowledge needed to generate an adequate response.\n2.  **Inability to Extract Specific Answers:** Even when the system identifies potentially relevant information (Sample 2), it fails to extract the specific answer requested by the question (e.g., the year). The system provides a general statement instead of the desired specific fact.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval from Knowledge Sources:** The most critical bottleneck is the inability to retrieve relevant sentences/knowledge snippets that directly address the question, even after expanding concepts.\n2.  **Precise Answer Extraction:** Even when relevant information is identified, the system struggles to extract the precise answer required by the question, leading to vague or incomplete responses.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe dominant error pattern is the failure to transition from expanded concepts and simulated results to concrete, verifiable answers supported by relevant evidence. The system seems to generate context but struggles to pinpoint the precise information that directly answers the question. This is reflected in the repeated \"No Relevant Sentences\" and the generic answers when evidence is present.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to effectively link expanded concepts with concrete information from a knowledge source and extract the specific answer required by the question. The system gets stuck in a conceptual understanding phase without effectively extracting the precise answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval:** Improve the information retrieval component to ensure that it retrieves relevant sentences based on the question and expanded concepts. Implement a more robust scoring mechanism to rank potentially relevant sentences.\n2.  **Answer Extraction:** Develop a more sophisticated answer extraction mechanism that can identify specific entities, dates, or phrases within the retrieved sentences that directly answer the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Knowledge Graph Integration:** Integrate a knowledge graph to improve information retrieval. Use the expanded concepts to query the knowledge graph and retrieve relevant entities and relationships.\n2.  **Fine-tune Retrieval Models:** Fine-tune the retrieval models on a dataset of question-answer pairs and relevant knowledge snippets. Train the model to predict the most relevant sentences given a question and its expanded concepts.\n3.  **Enhance Answer Extraction with Regular Expressions and NLP Techniques:** Implement regular expressions and NLP techniques to extract specific types of information (e.g., dates, names, quantities) from the retrieved sentences. Train a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify and classify entities in the retrieved sentences.\n4. Add intermediate outputs to display retrieved information from knowledge source.\n5. Add intermediate outputs showing score from retrieval.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n*   **Sample 2:** solution_generation, decision_making\n",

All tested samples resulted in errors, indicating a significant need for improvement.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs reveal a consistent pattern:\n\n*   **Concept Expansion:** The system successfully expands the initial question into related concepts, demonstrating a degree of semantic understanding.\n*   **Simulated Results:** The system generates \"Simulated Results\" that attempt to provide an answer based on the expanded concepts. However, these results often lack direct connection to concrete facts or evidence.\n*   **Information Retrieval Failure:** The \"Ranked Evidence: No Relevant Sentences\" output is a recurring issue, especially in the first two samples. This highlights a critical bottleneck in connecting the expanded concepts to relevant knowledge.\n*   **Vague Answers:** Even when evidence is retrieved (Sample 2), the answer provided is vague and doesn't precisely address the question's specific request. It reiterates general information instead of extracting the year of founding.\n*   **Missing Numerical Extraction:** The inability to extract numerical data (like a year) is apparent in Sample 2.\n*   **Lack of Coherence Between Simulated Results and Ranked Evidence:** The simulated results do not appear to leverage the ranked evidence in any meaningful way.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of concepts and can generate simulated answers. However, its core capabilities related to **information retrieval, precise answer extraction, and linking concepts to evidence** are severely deficient.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) were found in the provided outputs.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Concept Expansion:** The system demonstrates a capability to expand concepts related to the question, which suggests an attempt to create a broader understanding.\n2.  **Simulated Results Generation:** The system generates simulated results which is a step towards answering the question based on the expanded concepts.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Lack of Information Retrieval:** The \"Ranked Evidence: No Relevant Sentences\" output across several error cases indicates a crucial weakness in retrieving and utilizing information necessary for answering the questions. The system is failing to link the expanded concepts to specific knowledge needed to generate an adequate response.\n2.  **Inability to Extract Specific Answers:** Even when the system identifies potentially relevant information (Sample 2), it fails to extract the specific answer requested by the question (e.g., the year). The system provides a general statement instead of the desired specific fact.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval from Knowledge Sources:** The most critical bottleneck is the inability to retrieve relevant sentences/knowledge snippets that directly address the question, even after expanding concepts.\n2.  **Precise Answer Extraction:** Even when relevant information is identified, the system struggles to extract the precise answer required by the question, leading to vague or incomplete responses.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe dominant error pattern is the failure to transition from expanded concepts and simulated results to concrete, verifiable answers supported by relevant evidence. The system seems to generate context but struggles to pinpoint the precise information that directly answers the question. This is reflected in the repeated \"No Relevant Sentences\" and the generic answers when evidence is present.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to effectively link expanded concepts with concrete information from a knowledge source and extract the specific answer required by the question. The system gets stuck in a conceptual understanding phase without effectively extracting the precise answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval:** Improve the information retrieval component to ensure that it retrieves relevant sentences based on the question and expanded concepts. Implement a more robust scoring mechanism to rank potentially relevant sentences.\n2.  **Answer Extraction:** Develop a more sophisticated answer extraction mechanism that can identify specific entities, dates, or phrases within the retrieved sentences that directly answer the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Knowledge Graph Integration:** Integrate a knowledge graph to improve information retrieval. Use the expanded concepts to query the knowledge graph and retrieve relevant entities and relationships.\n2.  **Fine-tune Retrieval Models:** Fine-tune the retrieval models on a dataset of question-answer pairs and relevant knowledge snippets. Train the model to predict the most relevant sentences given a question and its expanded concepts.\n3.  **Enhance Answer Extraction with Regular Expressions and NLP Techniques:** Implement regular expressions and NLP techniques to extract specific types of information (e.g., dates, names, quantities) from the retrieved sentences. Train a named entity recognition (NER) model to identify and classify entities in the retrieved sentences.\n4. Add intermediate outputs to display retrieved information from knowledge source.\n5. Add intermediate outputs showing score from retrieval.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n*   **Sample 2:** solution_generation, decision_making\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nHere's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and the requested structure.\n\n**OVERALL PERFORMANCE:** The system currently exhibits very low accuracy (0.00). All tested samples resulted in errors, indicating a significant need for improvement.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs reveal a consistent pattern:\n\n*   **Concept Expansion:** The system successfully expands the initial question into related concepts, demonstrating a degree of semantic understanding.\n*   **Simulated Results:** The system generates \"Simulated Results\" that attempt to provide an answer based on the expanded concepts. However, these results often lack direct connection to concrete facts or evidence.\n*   **Information Retrieval Failure:** The \"Ranked Evidence: No Relevant Sentences\" output is a recurring issue, especially in the first two samples. This highlights a critical bottleneck in connecting the expanded concepts to relevant knowledge.\n*   **Vague Answers:** Even when evidence is retrieved (Sample 2), the answer provided is vague and doesn't precisely address the question's specific request. It reiterates general information instead of extracting the year of founding.\n*   **Missing Numerical Extraction:** The inability to extract numerical data (like a year) is apparent in Sample 2.\n*   **Lack of Coherence Between Simulated Results and Ranked Evidence:** The simulated results do not appear to leverage the ranked evidence in any meaningful way.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of concepts and can generate simulated answers. However, its core capabilities related to **information retrieval, precise answer extraction, and linking concepts to evidence** are severely deficient. The system currently operates more on a conceptual level without effectively grounding its responses in verifiable information.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Concept Expansion:** The ability to expand concepts is a valuable starting point, suggesting the system has a degree of semantic understanding.

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM with a chain-of-thought approach that extracts a rule, applies it, and then verifies the result. The problem is decomposed into rule extraction, rule application, and verification steps, each using a dedicated prompt. The LLM acts as an expert at identifying grid transformation patterns and applying them. The functions used are `main`, `solve_grid_transformation`, and `call_llm`; where `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation` to initiate the grid transformation process, and `solve_grid_transformation` uses `call_llm` to interact with the LLM for rule extraction, application, and verification.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.20 (1/5)\n*   Error samples: 4/5\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system outputs a grid filled with zeros. This indicates a complete failure to apply the correct transformation rules. It may be that the system is defaulting to an empty grid when it cannot determine the correct transformation. The dimensions are also incorrect. The golden answer had dimensions of 3x3 and the system output dimensions of 3x3.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system outputs the raw Python code intended for the transformation instead of executing it and providing the numerical grid. This suggests a failure in code execution, output handling, or a combination of both.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system outputs a JSON-formatted list of lists, implying it's attempting to represent a grid. However, the dimensions and values are completely wrong and the formatting is off. The golden answer had dimensions of 5x5 but the system output had dimensions of 1x5.\n*   **Sample ID 4:** _No execution output provided._ Based on the Error Analysis Report, we would expect to see issues with numerical transformations, potentially leading to incorrect values in the output grid. This is where we see the difficulties in numerical reasoning and extraction of salient features of the grids\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates limited capabilities in solving the given grid transformation task. While it shows some ability to recognize patterns and understand the structure of the input data, its core transformation logic is weak, inconsistent, and prone to errors in code execution and output formatting. The system struggles with robust transformation, code execution, output generation, numerical reasoning, and extraction of salient features of the grids.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Partial):** The system shows some promise in recognizing patterns from training examples and attempting to apply them to test inputs. This foundation is crucial to build upon.\n*   **Structural Understanding (Partial):** The system seems to understand the grid-like structure of the data, which is necessary for implementing any transformation logic.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Transformation Algorithm Robustness:** The current algorithm is not robust enough to handle the variations in the input grids and apply consistent transformations.\n*   **Code Execution Reliability:** The system frequently fails to execute the generated transformation code, leading to the raw code being outputted instead of the transformed grid.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning and Feature Extraction:** The system demonstrates poor numerical reasoning capabilities, leading to incorrect numerical transformations and failure to extract important features from grids.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system struggles to present the final answer in the correct format (numerical grid), often outputting raw code or incorrect data structures.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to improve is **transformation algorithm robustness and code execution reliability**. The system needs to be able to consistently and accurately apply transformations to the grid, and this requires a more robust algorithm coupled with reliable code execution.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Feature Extraction and Representation:** Develop a feature extraction module to identify key aspects of the input grids (e.g., positions of specific numbers, relationships between numbers, symmetry). Represent these features in a structured way to aid the transformation logic. This addresses numerical reasoning deficiencies.\n2.  **Introduce Rule-Based Transformation Engine with Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a rule-based engine that uses the extracted features to select and apply appropriate transformations. If no specific rules apply or the transformation is predicted to be problematic, implement a fallback mechanism that defaults to a simple, safe transformation or returns an informative error. This reduces the chances of incorrect transformations and code output.\n3.  **Implement Explicit Code Execution with Error Handling and Output Validation:** Implement a controlled code execution environment within the system. Use a Python interpreter to execute the transformation code and capture any errors. Implement comprehensive error handling to catch runtime exceptions and provide informative error messages. Also, add validation steps to ensure the output grid has the correct dimensions, data types, and value ranges.\n4.  **Develop Unit Tests for Individual Transformation Rules:** Create unit tests to verify the correctness of each transformation rule. This will help to identify and fix errors early in the development process.\n5.  **Implement a Logging System for Debugging:** Add a logging system to track the reasoning process of the system. Record the extracted features, the selected transformation rules, and any intermediate outputs. This will help to debug the system and identify areas for improvement.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the current performance (20% accuracy), the AI system is currently exhibiting **stable but low capabilities**. Without significant improvements to the transformation algorithm and code execution reliability, the system is unlikely to achieve a satisfactory level of performance. The proposed improvements are targeted at increasing capabilities.\n",

This suggests a failure in code execution, output handling, or a combination of both.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system outputs a JSON-formatted list of lists, implying it's attempting to represent a grid. However, the dimensions and values are completely wrong and the formatting is off. The golden answer had dimensions of 5x5 but the system output had dimensions of 1x5.\n*   **Sample ID 4:** _No execution output provided._ Based on the Error Analysis Report, we would expect to see issues with numerical transformations, potentially leading to incorrect values in the output grid. This is where we see the difficulties in numerical reasoning and extraction of salient features of the grids\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates limited capabilities in solving the given grid transformation task. While it shows some ability to recognize patterns and understand the structure of the input data, its core transformation logic is weak, inconsistent, and prone to errors in code execution and output formatting. The system struggles with robust transformation, code execution, output generation, numerical reasoning, and extraction of salient features of the grids.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Partial):** The system shows some promise in recognizing patterns from training examples and attempting to apply them to test inputs. This foundation is crucial to build upon.\n*   **Structural Understanding (Partial):** The system seems to understand the grid-like structure of the data, which is necessary for implementing any transformation logic.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Transformation Algorithm Robustness:** The current algorithm is not robust enough to handle the variations in the input grids and apply consistent transformations.\n*   **Code Execution Reliability:** The system frequently fails to execute the generated transformation code, leading to the raw code being outputted instead of the transformed grid.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning and Feature Extraction:** The system demonstrates poor numerical reasoning capabilities, leading to incorrect numerical transformations and failure to extract important features from grids.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system struggles to present the final answer in the correct format (numerical grid), often outputting raw code or incorrect data structures.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to improve is **transformation algorithm robustness and code execution reliability**. The system needs to be able to consistently and accurately apply transformations to the grid, and this requires a more robust algorithm coupled with reliable code execution.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Feature Extraction and Representation:** Develop a feature extraction module to identify key aspects of the input grids (e.g., positions of specific numbers, relationships between numbers, symmetry). Represent these features in a structured way to aid the transformation logic. This addresses numerical reasoning deficiencies.\n2.  **Introduce Rule-Based Transformation Engine with Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a rule-based engine that uses the extracted features to select and apply appropriate transformations. If no specific rules apply or the transformation is predicted to be problematic, implement a fallback mechanism that defaults to a simple, safe transformation or returns an informative error. This reduces the chances of incorrect transformations and code output.\n3.  **Implement Explicit Code Execution with Error Handling and Output Validation:** Implement a controlled code execution environment within the system. Use a Python interpreter to execute the transformation code and capture any errors. Implement comprehensive error handling to catch runtime exceptions and provide informative error messages. Also, add validation steps to ensure the output grid has the correct dimensions, data types, and value ranges.\n4.  **Develop Unit Tests for Individual Transformation Rules:** Create unit tests to verify the correctness of each transformation rule. This will help to identify and fix errors early in the development process.\n5.  **Implement a Logging System for Debugging:** Add a logging system to track the reasoning process of the system. Record the extracted features, the selected transformation rules, and any intermediate outputs. This will help to debug the system and identify areas for improvement.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the current performance (20% accuracy), the AI system is currently exhibiting **stable but low capabilities**. Without significant improvements to the transformation algorithm and code execution reliability, the system is unlikely to achieve a satisfactory level of performance. The proposed improvements are targeted at increasing capabilities.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to solve grid transformation problems by recursively decomposing the grid into subgrids, transforming each subgrid based on local patterns, and then recomposing the grid. The problem is decomposed into three main steps: `decompose_grid`, `transform_subgrid`, and `recompose_grid`, each guided by an LLM with a specific expert role. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates this process, calling helper functions, and uses `call_llm` to interface with the Gemini model, passing a prompt and system instruction to generate the desired output for each step. Error handling is included to ensure the validity of each stage of the process.",

This suggests a failure to recognize that the transformation involves changing the grid size.\n2.  **Value Discrepancies:** Across all error cases, the system-generated grids contain different values at different indices compared to the golden answers, indicating a failure to apply the correct transformation logic.\n3.  **No Clear Transformation Logic:** The system's responses appear to apply arbitrary changes rather than following a consistent pattern derived from the training examples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the system's **failure to accurately learn and generalize transformation rules** from the training examples to the test input.

This can help catch errors and improve the overall accuracy.\n4.  **Introduce a module to select subgrids:** In cases where the output grid has different dimensions from the input grid, introduce a module that identifies the subgrid within the input grid that corresponds to the output grid.

Input: Training grid pairs. Output: Encoded transformation rules.\n\n2.  **Enhance Feature Extraction:**\n    *   **Details:** Move beyond directly feeding grid values into the transformation model. Extract more informative features that capture the underlying structure and relationships within the grid.\n    *   **Features to Consider:**\n        *   **Edge Detection:** Using Sobel or Canny filters to identify boundaries and shapes.\n        *   **Connected Component Analysis:** To identify distinct objects or regions within the grid.\n        *   **Spatial Statistics:**  Calculating statistics like mean, variance, and entropy for different regions.\n        *   **Symmetry Detection:**  Detecting symmetrical patterns in the grid.\n    *   **Action:** Create a feature extraction pipeline that pre-processes the input grids before they are fed into the transformation model.\n\n3.  **Introduce a Validation Step with Explicit Rules:**\n    *   **Details:**  Before outputting the final grid, implement a validation step that checks if the generated grid satisfies certain constraints and rules derived from the training examples.\n    *   **Rules:**  These rules can include:\n        *   **Dimension constraints:** The output grid must have a specific size.\n        *   **Value constraints:** The output grid can only contain certain values.\n        *   **Relationship constraints:** The relationship between different regions in the output grid must be consistent with the training examples.\n    *   **Action:**  Develop a validation function that takes the generated output grid and the extracted transformation rules as input. The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the grid is valid.\n\n4.  **Debugging and Tracing:**  Add extensive print statements, logging, and intermediate output visualizations to enable tracing the reasoning process during development. This will be essential for understanding why the system is making certain decisions.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capabilities are currently **stable but extremely low**. Without significant intervention and the implementation of the above recommendations, the system will not improve its performance. The focus needs to shift from basic data handling to core reasoning and pattern recognition.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using an LLM to identify and apply transformation rules based on neighboring cell values. It decomposes the problem into analyzing contextual value mappings from examples and then iteratively transforming the input grid based on these mappings. The LLM acts as an expert in identifying grid transformation patterns. The function `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process, using `call_llm` to interact with the LLM for both extracting mappings and transforming the grid, and includes basic validation on the LLM output. The `main` function serves as a wrapper to initiate the grid transformation process.",

Let's analyze the contextual dependencies and the steps involved.\n\n1.  **Identifying Clusters:** The algorithm seems to identify connected regions (clusters) of non-zero values in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Determining Representative Value:** The value chosen to represent the cluster in the output seems like the 'majority' value for each cluster, but this is too simplistic.\n    More precisely, it looks like the max value of the cluster after the zeros have been removed.\n\n3.  **Output Grid Positioning:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid. The mapping from input to output locations isn't immediately obvious but judging by the examples, it appears that each cluster is represented as a 3x3 region in the output grid.\n\n4.  **Padding with Zeros:** Areas outside the cluster influence are padded with zeros in the output grid.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the transformation applied to the training examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Clusters: {3}, {4}, {2}, {6}\n    *   Max Values: 3, 4, 2, 6.\n    *   Output:\n        ```\n        [[0, 4, 0],\n         [4, 4, 4],\n         [0, 4, 0]]\n        ```\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Clusters: {2}, {3,8}, {1}\n    *   Max Values: 2, 8, 1,\n    *   Output:\n        ```\n        [[0, 3, 3],\n         [3, 3, 0],\n         [0, 3, 3]]\n        ```\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Clusters: {2,8}, {3}, {1}\n    *   Max Values: 8, 3, 1\n    *   Output:\n        ```\n        [[2, 2, 2],\n         [0, 2, 0],\n         [2, 2, 0]]\n        ```\n\nBased on the analysis, transform the test input as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Clusters:** {1,7,8}, {2}, {3}.\n\n2.  **Determine Representative Value:** From those, the respective max values for each are {8}, {2}, {3}\n\n3.  **Create output Grid** Create the output using these new max values.\n\n```python\n[\n  [1, 1, 0],\n  [1, 7, 7],\n  [2, 2, 3]\n]\n```\nTransformed Grid Text: ```python\n[\n  [1, 7, 8],\n  [1, 7, 7],\n  [2, 2, 3]\n]\n```\nANSWER_START\n```python\n[\n  [1, 7, 8],\n  [1, 7, 7],\n  [2, 2, 3]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

Let's analyze the contextual dependencies and the steps involved.\n\n1.  **Identifying Clusters:** The algorithm seems to identify connected regions (clusters) of non-zero values in the input grid.\n\n2.  **Determining Representative Value:** The value chosen to represent the cluster in the output seems like the 'majority' value for each cluster, but this is too simplistic.\n    More precisely, it looks like the max value of the cluster after the zeros have been removed.\n\n3.  **Output Grid Positioning:** The output grid is smaller than the input grid. The mapping from input to output locations isn't immediately obvious but judging by the examples, it appears that each cluster is represented as a 3x3 region in the output grid.\n\n4.  **Padding with Zeros:** Areas outside the cluster influence are padded with zeros in the output grid.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the transformation applied to the training examples:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Clusters: {3}, {4}, {2}, {6}\n    *   Max Values: 3, 4, 2, 6.\n    *   Output:\n        ```\n        [[0, 4, 0],\n         [4, 4, 4],\n         [0, 4, 0]]\n        ```\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Clusters: {2}, {3,8}, {1}\n    *   Max Values: 2, 8, 1,\n    *   Output:\n        ```\n        [[0, 3, 3],\n         [3, 3, 0],\n         [0, 3, 3]]\n        ```\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Clusters: {2,8}, {3}, {1}\n    *   Max Values: 8, 3, 1\n    *   Output:\n        ```\n        [[2, 2, 2],\n         [0, 2, 0],\n         [2, 2, 0]]\n        ```\n\nBased on the analysis, transform the test input as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Clusters:** {1,7,8}, {2}, {3}.\n\n2.  **Determine Representative Value:** From those, the respective max values for each are {8}, {2}, {3}\n\n3.  **Create output Grid** Create the output using these new max values.\n\n```python\n[\n  [1, 1, 0],\n  [1, 7, 7],\n  [2, 2, 3]\n]\n```\nTransformed Grid Text: ```python\n[\n  [1, 7, 8],\n  [1, 7, 7],\n  [2, 2, 3]\n]\n```\nANSWER_START\n```python\n[\n  [1, 7, 8],\n  [1, 7, 7],\n  [2, 2, 3]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

      "text_report": "Here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided information, focusing on actionable insights for improvement:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs highlight several key issues:\n\n*   **Flawed Pattern Recognition:** The \"Extracted Contextual Mappings\" sections reveal an attempt to understand the transformations, but the interpretations are often incorrect. For example, the first sample misidentifies the pattern of cluster representation. The third sample does a better job of identifying the high-level replication strategy, but fails to generalize properly.\n*   **Oversimplified Logic:** Even when identifying parts of the correct transformation process, the generated code often reflects oversimplified logic, resulting in incorrect outputs. This is evident in the value replacement step of Sample 3.\n*   **Inability to Generalize:** The system struggles to adapt the learned patterns from the training examples to the specific test case. This generalization failure is the root cause of many errors.\n*   **Reliance on High-Level Descriptions:** The system generates explanations describing the *idea* of the transformation but struggles to translate that into precise and correct code.\n*   **Lack of Verification:** There is no effective verification step. The system generates code and outputs based on flawed assumptions, and the lack of verification propagates these errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a basic capability for code generation and attempts at contextual analysis, but it struggles significantly with pattern recognition, accurate interpretation of training data, and logical reasoning.  It can generate *syntactically* correct code but consistently fails to generate *logically* correct code. The system can articulate potential transformation strategies, but fails in the implementation of those strategies.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can produce executable Python code.\n*   **Contextual Analysis (Attempted):** The system attempts to analyze the training data and extract relevant features. The system needs to do a much better job, but it at least recognizes that it needs to do this.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The primary weakness is the system's inability to accurately identify complex patterns and generalize them to new inputs.\n*   **Inaccurate Data Interpretation:** The system often misunderstands the relationships within the training data.\n*   **Lack of Logic Verification:** The absence of a verification mechanism allows logical errors to propagate unchecked.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most critical area for improvement is **robust pattern generalization**. The system needs to move beyond superficial analysis and develop a deeper understanding of the transformation rules.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the error analysis and weaknesses, here are concrete changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a CNN-based Pattern Recognition Module:** Replace the existing pattern recognition approach with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for grid-based data. This will allow the system to automatically learn more complex spatial relationships.\n    *   *Specific Implementation:* Design the CNN with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract relevant features from the grid data. Consider using transfer learning if pre-trained CNN models are available.\n2.  **Introduce Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data with variations of the existing examples. Include rotations (90, 180, 270 degrees), flips (horizontal and vertical), and small translations of the grids. This will improve the system's robustness to variations in the input data.\n    *   *Specific Implementation:* Implement a data augmentation pipeline that automatically generates these variations during training. Track the performance improvements from each type of augmentation.\n3.  **Develop a Multi-Stage Reasoning Pipeline:** Decompose the task into separate stages:\n    *   **Stage 1: Pattern Analysis:** Analyze the training examples and identify potential transformation rules.\n    *   **Stage 2: Rule Application:** Apply the identified rule to the test input.\n    *   **Stage 3: Verification:** Test the transformed output against the training examples to ensure consistency.\n\n    *Specific Implementation:* This requires rewriting core parts of the model. Focus initially on clear separation of responsibilities. Stage 1 should *only* produce a hypothesis about the transformation. Stage 2 *only* applies that hypothesis. Stage 3 explicitly checks against the training data.*\n4.  **Add a Logic Verification Component:** Implement a component that evaluates the generated code by executing it on the training examples and comparing the output to the expected results. This component should identify logical errors and attempt to correct them. If correction is not possible, it should reject the code and trigger a new attempt.\n    *   *Specific Implementation:* Integrate a small-scale execution environment for running the generated code. Define a similarity metric to compare the predicted output with the expected output. If the similarity falls below a threshold, flag the code as containing errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance data, the current capabilities are **stable but inadequate**. The accuracy is low, and the system consistently makes errors in pattern recognition and logical reasoning. The system is making the *attempt* at contextual analysis, but needs significant improvement to be effective. Without implementing the recommended improvements, the capabilities are unlikely to improve.\n",

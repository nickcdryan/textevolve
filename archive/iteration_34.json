  "approach_summary": "The script implements a \"Knowledge Retrieval with Targeted Validation\" approach to answer questions. It decomposes the problem into generating multiple search queries, retrieving information for each, extracting an answer, and validating the answer using a validation agent. The agent roles are search query generator, search engine simulator, answer extractor, and fact validator. The functions used are `call_llm` (to interact with the LLM), `generate_search_queries`, `retrieve_info`, `extract_answer`, `validate_answer`, and `main`. The overall workflow involves generating search queries for a question, retrieving information for each query, extracting an answer from the retrieved information, validating the extracted answer, and returning the answer if it is validated or indicates that it could not be validated.",

The system identifies a town in Western Australia, but it's the wrong one based on the given constraints (location relative to other towns and proximity to Perth).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inaccurate knowledge base or flawed retrieval mechanism when reasoning about geography. Specifically, the system is unable to accurately pinpoint a location (Capel) given its description as being in the Southwest region of Western Australia, 212 km south of Perth, and midway between Bunbury and Busselton.

Consider using external APIs or datasets specializing in geographical information.\n2.  **Implement a Distance Calculation Module:** Integrate a module that can calculate distances between locations based on their coordinates. This will enable the system to verify if a location meets the distance constraints specified in the question.\n3.  **Develop a Constraint-Based Filtering Mechanism:** Implement a filtering mechanism that uses the constraints provided in the question to narrow down the possible solutions. For the error case, this would involve filtering locations based on their proximity to Perth, Bunbury, and Busselton, and their location within the Southwest region of Western Australia.\n4. Add \"print\" statements to dump to the output (that can be seen later) intermediate results during question processing and the retrieval of potential matches from the knowledge base. This will make debugging far easier. For example, you can dump the locations found that match some of the constraints like distance and region. You can also dump the confidence scores, etc.\n5. Before outputting, make sure the answer satisfies *all* constraints.

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and capability mapping.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs demonstrate that the system can generally extract and present information in the expected format (\"ANSWER_START ... ANSWER_END\"). However, one output reveals a crucial flaw: an incorrect answer for the geography question. The system identifies \"Waroona\" as the answer, but the Error Analysis Report establishes that \"Capel\" is the correct answer, given the constraints. This indicates that while the system might be retrieving information, it's failing to verify its accuracy against the provided constraints and/or the underlying knowledge base. The correct answers validate information extraction and formatting capabilities, while the incorrect answer clearly demonstrates a failure in constraint satisfaction, geographical reasoning, and accurate knowledge retrieval.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits promising information extraction and formatting capabilities. However, its overall effectiveness is significantly hampered by weaknesses in knowledge retrieval, geographical reasoning, and constraint satisfaction. The system's ability to deliver accurate answers is inconsistent, with a notable failure in a geography-related question. This inconsistency reduces the reliability of the system and necessitates focused improvements in its reasoning and knowledge-handling abilities.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction & Formatting:** The system can effectively extract relevant information from the question and present the answer in the specified \"ANSWER_START ... ANSWER_END\" format. This strength provides a solid foundation for more complex tasks.\n*   **Question Understanding:** The system appears to understand the context of the question, even when delivering incorrect answers. This implies a degree of semantic analysis, which is valuable.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Geographical Reasoning:** The system demonstrates a significant weakness in geographical reasoning, leading to incorrect answers when dealing with location-based constraints.\n*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** The system struggles to effectively use all provided constraints to narrow down the possible solutions, leading to inaccurate results.\n*   **Knowledge Base Accuracy and Retrieval:** The system's knowledge base may contain inaccuracies, and the retrieval mechanism appears to be flawed, leading to the retrieval of incorrect information or the inability to find the correct information.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust verification mechanism to ensure that the proposed answer meets all the given constraints before outputting the result.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most crucial area for improvement is **Geographical Reasoning and Constraint Satisfaction**. Addressing this weakness will directly improve the accuracy of the system, especially for location-based queries, and indirectly address the underlying issues related to knowledge retrieval and solution verification.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement the Distance Calculation Module:** Immediately integrate a module that can calculate distances between locations based on geographical coordinates. This is a relatively straightforward implementation that can have a significant impact on the system's ability to satisfy distance-based constraints. Prioritize the integration of publicly available libraries or APIs specializing in geospatial calculations to accelerate development and ensure accuracy.\n2.  **Augment the Knowledge Base with Bounding Box Data:** Expand the knowledge base to include bounding box or polygon data for geographical regions (e.g., \"Southwest region of Western Australia\"). This will allow the system to definitively determine if a location falls within a specified region.  Focus on readily available geographic datasets.\n3.  **Implement Constraint-Based Filtering:** Develop a rule-based or probabilistic filtering mechanism that explicitly prioritizes locations meeting *all* constraints before outputting an answer. This requires systematically evaluating each candidate answer against each constraint (e.g., \"Is Capel within the Southwest region? Is Capel approximately 212 km south of Perth?\").\n4.  **Implement Intermediate Result Logging:** Add \"print\" statements (or equivalent logging) to capture intermediate results, especially during knowledge retrieval and constraint evaluation. Log potential candidate answers, confidence scores (if available), and the results of constraint checks. This logging will provide invaluable insights for debugging and identifying the source of errors.\n5.  **Implement Solution Verification and Rejection:** Before outputting an answer, implement a final verification step that *explicitly checks if all constraints are satisfied*. If any constraint is violated, the system should *not* output the answer and instead log an error message indicating which constraints failed and why.  This will prevent the output of incorrect answers and force the system to explicitly handle constraint violations.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the data, the capability trend is currently **stable with a significant area of weakness**. While the system demonstrates some core capabilities, the geographical reasoning error highlights a persistent issue that needs immediate attention. Addressing the \"Improvement Focus\" and implementing the \"Actionable Recommendations\" are crucial to shifting the trend towards improvement. Ignoring these issues will likely lead to a decline in overall performance as the complexity and scope of the questions increase.\n",

ANSWER_END).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n*   The system sometimes provides incorrect answers despite understanding the question's context.\n*   The system struggles with geographical reasoning, specifically locating a town based on its description.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Knowledge Retrieval/Fact Verification:** The system seems to have an incomplete or flawed knowledge base or is unable to effectively query it to verify the correctness of candidate answers.\n*   **Geographical Reasoning and Constraint Satisfaction:** The system fails to adequately reason about geographical relationships (location, distance, region) and use them to constrain the possible answers.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe error case indicates a failure in geographical reasoning and knowledge retrieval. The system identifies a town in Western Australia, but it's the wrong one based on the given constraints (location relative to other towns and proximity to Perth).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inaccurate knowledge base or flawed retrieval mechanism when reasoning about geography. Specifically, the system is unable to accurately pinpoint a location (Capel) given its description as being in the Southwest region of Western Australia, 212 km south of Perth, and midway between Bunbury and Busselton. It incorrectly identified Waroona.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Knowledge Base Accuracy:** Enhance the accuracy and completeness of the knowledge base, particularly concerning geographical information.\n*   **Geographical Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to reason about locations, distances, and spatial relationships.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Strengthen the system's capability to identify and apply constraints, such as proximity to other locations, to narrow down potential solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Augment the Knowledge Base:** Enrich the knowledge base with detailed geographical data, including coordinates, distances between locations, and regional classifications. Consider using external APIs or datasets specializing in geographical information.\n2.  **Implement a Distance Calculation Module:** Integrate a module that can calculate distances between locations based on their coordinates. This will enable the system to verify if a location meets the distance constraints specified in the question.\n3.  **Develop a Constraint-Based Filtering Mechanism:** Implement a filtering mechanism that uses the constraints provided in the question to narrow down the possible solutions. For the error case, this would involve filtering locations based on their proximity to Perth, Bunbury, and Busselton, and their location within the Southwest region of Western Australia.\n4. Add \"print\" statements to dump to the output (that can be seen later) intermediate results during question processing and the retrieval of potential matches from the knowledge base. This will make debugging far easier. For example, you can dump the locations found that match some of the constraints like distance and region. You can also dump the confidence scores, etc.\n5. Before outputting, make sure the answer satisfies *all* constraints. If it does not, indicate this and don't output an answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Successful\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect solution\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the solution against the constraints\n    *   decision_making: Made an incorrect decision\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and capability mapping.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs demonstrate that the system can generally extract and present information in the expected format (\"ANSWER_START ... ANSWER_END\"). However, one output reveals a crucial flaw: an incorrect answer for the geography question. The system identifies \"Waroona\" as the answer, but the Error Analysis Report establishes that \"Capel\" is the correct answer, given the constraints. This indicates that while the system might be retrieving information, it's failing to verify its accuracy against the provided constraints and/or the underlying knowledge base. The correct answers validate information extraction and formatting capabilities, while the incorrect answer clearly demonstrates a failure in constraint satisfaction, geographical reasoning, and accurate knowledge retrieval.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits promising information extraction and formatting capabilities. However, its overall effectiveness is significantly hampered by weaknesses in knowledge retrieval, geographical reasoning, and constraint satisfaction. The system's ability to deliver accurate answers is inconsistent, with a notable failure in a geography-related question. This inconsistency reduces the reliability of the system and necessitates focused improvements in its reasoning and knowledge-handling abilities.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction & Formatting:** The system can effectively extract relevant information from the question and present the answer in the specified \"ANSWER_START ... ANSWER_END\" format. This strength provides a solid foundation for more complex tasks.\n*   **Question Understanding:** The system appears to understand the context of the question, even when delivering incorrect answers. This implies a degree of semantic analysis, which is valuable.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Geographical Reasoning:** The system demonstrates a significant weakness in geographical reasoning, leading to incorrect answers when dealing with location-based constraints.\n*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** The system struggles to effectively use all provided constraints to narrow down the possible solutions, leading to inaccurate results.\n*   **Knowledge Base Accuracy and Retrieval:** The system's knowledge base may contain inaccuracies, and the retrieval mechanism appears to be flawed, leading to the retrieval of incorrect information or the inability to find the correct information.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust verification mechanism to ensure that the proposed answer meets all the given constraints before outputting the result.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most crucial area for improvement is **Geographical Reasoning and Constraint Satisfaction**. Addressing this weakness will directly improve the accuracy of the system, especially for location-based queries, and indirectly address the underlying issues related to knowledge retrieval and solution verification.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement the Distance Calculation Module:** Immediately integrate a module that can calculate distances between locations based on geographical coordinates. This is a relatively straightforward implementation that can have a significant impact on the system's ability to satisfy distance-based constraints. Prioritize the integration of publicly available libraries or APIs specializing in geospatial calculations to accelerate development and ensure accuracy.\n2.  **Augment the Knowledge Base with Bounding Box Data:** Expand the knowledge base to include bounding box or polygon data for geographical regions (e.g., \"Southwest region of Western Australia\"). This will allow the system to definitively determine if a location falls within a specified region.  Focus on readily available geographic datasets.\n3.  **Implement Constraint-Based Filtering:** Develop a rule-based or probabilistic filtering mechanism that explicitly prioritizes locations meeting *all* constraints before outputting an answer. This requires systematically evaluating each candidate answer against each constraint (e.g., \"Is Capel within the Southwest region? Is Capel approximately 212 km south of Perth?\").\n4.  **Implement Intermediate Result Logging:** Add \"print\" statements (or equivalent logging) to capture intermediate results, especially during knowledge retrieval and constraint evaluation. Log potential candidate answers, confidence scores (if available), and the results of constraint checks. This logging will provide invaluable insights for debugging and identifying the source of errors.\n5.  **Implement Solution Verification and Rejection:** Before outputting an answer, implement a final verification step that *explicitly checks if all constraints are satisfied*. If any constraint is violated, the system should *not* output the answer and instead log an error message indicating which constraints failed and why.  This will prevent the output of incorrect answers and force the system to explicitly handle constraint violations.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the data, the capability trend is currently **stable with a significant area of weakness**. While the system demonstrates some core capabilities, the geographical reasoning error highlights a persistent issue that needs immediate attention. Addressing the \"Improvement Focus\" and implementing the \"Actionable Recommendations\" are crucial to shifting the trend towards improvement. Ignoring these issues will likely lead to a decline in overall performance as the complexity and scope of the questions increase.\n"

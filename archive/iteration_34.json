  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to solve grid transformation problems by extracting spatial relationships, predicting output dimensions, and synthesizing a new grid based on these factors. It decomposes the problem into three steps: spatial relationship extraction, dimension prediction, and rule-based synthesis. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates the process, using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model with specific prompts for each step. The overall workflow involves extracting relationships from training examples, predicting output dimensions based on the extracted relationships, and generating the transformed grid, with error handling and a fallback mechanism.",

(Example 2, Success case)\n*   **Dimensionality Prediction:** The system correctly reasons about how the dimensions of the input grid relate to the output grid, based on the examples. (Example 2, Success case)\n*   **Mirroring logic in simple cases**: It can identify mirroring pattern and apply it to a basic test grid.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Interpretation Complexity**: The system struggles to consistently interpret and apply complex, multi-faceted patterns in the training examples, particularly when it involves mirroring or specific row/column manipulations. (Example 0, Error case)\n*   **Contextual Adaptation:** The system can fail to adapt the learned pattern appropriately to the specific context of the test input. It might misinterpret how the training examples generalize to unseen cases. (Example 1, Error case)\n*   **Lack of Robustness**: The system's transformation logic appears brittle and easily disrupted by slight variations in the input or training data. (Example 1, Error case)\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Complex Pattern Generalization**: The inability to generalize complex patterns reliably is the most significant bottleneck. It results in inconsistent application of transformations.\n*   **Accurate Interpretation**: An inability to accurately interpret and follow through complex instructions and adapt to variations in examples.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misapplied Mirroring**: In Example 0, the system attempts to mirror the left side to the right, but the exact mirroring logic is flawed, resulting in incorrect placement of elements.\n*   **Incomplete Pattern Replication**: In Example 1, the system correctly identifies that the first two rows need to be copied, but doesn't completely do so.\n*   **Over-Simplification**: There is a tendency to over-simplify the transformations learned from the training data, leading to incorrect extrapolations.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inaccurate generalization of observed patterns from the training examples to the test input.** The system's reasoning fails to account for all aspects of the pattern or the specific nuances of the test case, leading to flawed transformations. The system does not fully understand the prompt.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Extraction and Encoding**: Enhance the system's ability to extract patterns from training examples. This could involve more sophisticated feature extraction and a more robust representation of spatial relationships.\n*   **Contextual Reasoning**: Improve the system's contextual reasoning abilities. It needs to be better at understanding how the learned patterns should be adapted based on the specific characteristics of the input grid, like size, and presence of certain numbers and their placement.\n*   **Iterative Refinement**: The system can refine its understanding and apply the learned pattern in an iterative fashion.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce a Rule-Based System:** Augment the existing system with a rule-based component that explicitly encodes common grid transformation operations like mirroring, rotation, and shifting. This can provide a more robust foundation for applying transformations.\n\n2.  **Implement a Verification Stage**: Add a verification stage to the pipeline where the generated solution is checked against the training examples to ensure consistency. This could involve calculating similarity metrics or explicitly verifying that the transformed grid satisfies the relationships observed in the training data.\n\n3.  **Add Intermediate Print Statements**: Insert print statements and intermediate outputs to track the execution flow and to observe and determine why a particular decision was made.\n\n4.  **Example Augmentation**: If feasible, augment the training dataset with more diverse examples that cover a wider range of transformation types and grid structures.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (Error):**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to fully extract pattern\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate correct grid transformation\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify and correct\n*   **Sample ID 1 (Error):**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to fully extract pattern\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate correct grid transformation\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify and correct\n",

It mirrors the top portion of the grid, but does not extend the mirroring to the bottom. The \"3\" section of the grid is replicated incorrectly, with 3,3,3,3 instead of mirroring the whole grid. The system appears to understand *what* operation to perform (mirroring), but not *how* to correctly apply it in detail to the entire grid.\n*   **Partial Pattern Application (Example 1):** The system identifies the copying of the first two rows as a pattern, but fails to completely implement this pattern. The output displays some of the data but incorrectly. Furthermore, there's no clear logic connecting why it reverses and copies some rows, rather than the top two rows.\n*   **Reasoning Process Errors:** The \"Extracted Relationships\" section shows flawed reasoning. For Example 1, it recognizes \"The first two rows of the input grid are copied directly to the first two rows of the output grid,\" but the subsequent steps are illogical and do not accurately represent the transformation described.\n*   **Dimension Prediction:** Although explicitly stated, the dimension predictions are accurate; however the grid dimensions are not.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The output is well-formatted and includes helpful intermediate steps such as \"Extracted Relationships,\" \"Predicted Dimensions,\" and the final \"ANSWER.\" This makes debugging and analysis easier.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a *limited* understanding of spatial reasoning and pattern recognition in grid transformations. It can identify some basic patterns (mirroring, copying) but struggles to consistently and accurately apply these patterns to new inputs. Its reasoning process is often flawed, leading to incorrect transformations and inaccurate outputs.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Basic):** Ability to identify basic patterns like mirroring and copying rows/columns.\n*   **Dimensionality Awareness:** The system can reason about the dimensions of the output based on the input.\n*   **Structured Output:** The structured output, with intermediate steps, is very helpful for debugging.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complex Pattern Generalization:** Major difficulty in generalizing complex, multi-faceted patterns. This includes variations of mirroring, and combinations of different grid manipulations.\n*   **Contextual Adaptation:** Struggles to adapt learned patterns to the specific context of a new input grid (e.g., grid size, element placement).\n*   **Inaccurate Implementation:** Even when a pattern is identified, the system often fails to implement it correctly.\n*   **Flawed Reasoning:** The system's reasoning process is prone to errors, leading to incorrect conclusions about the transformation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Complex Pattern Generalization**. The system needs to be able to reliably extract, encode, and apply complex grid transformation patterns.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Pattern Extraction:** Implement a more sophisticated pattern extraction module. This could involve:\n    *   **Feature Engineering:** Identifying key features within the grid, such as lines, shapes, symmetry, and repetition of elements.\n    *   **Spatial Relationship Encoding:** Developing a robust way to represent spatial relationships between different elements in the grid (e.g., \"element A is to the left of element B,\" \"element C is mirrored across a vertical axis\").\n\n2.  **Improve Reasoning Process:** Focus on improving the logical reasoning process. This could involve:\n    *   **Rule-Based System (Augmentation):** Introduce a rule-based component that explicitly encodes common grid transformation operations (mirroring, rotation, shifting, copying, etc.). This component can provide a solid foundation for applying transformations and prevent common errors.\n    *   **Decomposition:** Decompose complex transformations into smaller, more manageable steps.\n    *   **Step-by-Step Validation:** After each step in the transformation process, validate that the current state of the grid is consistent with the learned pattern.\n\n3.  **Implement a Verification Stage (with Similarity Metrics):** Before outputting the final answer, implement a verification stage.\n    *   **Similarity Metrics:** Calculate similarity metrics (e.g., pixel-wise difference, structural similarity) between the generated output and the training examples. If the similarity is below a certain threshold, flag the output as potentially incorrect and attempt to refine it.\n    *   **Explicit Verification:** Explicitly verify that the transformed grid satisfies the relationships observed in the training data. For example, if the training data shows that the top row is always copied to the bottom row, verify that this is also true in the generated output.\n\n4.  **Enhanced Error Logging & Debugging**:\n    *   **Increase verbosity of logging:** Log the intermediate states of the grid and the decisions made at each step of the transformation process. This will provide valuable insights into where the system is going wrong.\n    *   **Add Intermediate Print Statements**: Insert print statements and intermediate outputs to track the execution flow and to observe and determine why a particular decision was made.\n\n5.  **Augment Training Data (Strategic Expansion):** While it may not always be feasible, strategically augment the training dataset with examples that specifically target the system's weaknesses. For example, if the system struggles with mirroring, add more examples that involve different types of mirroring (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are **stable but low**. Without significant improvements to pattern generalization and reasoning, the system will likely remain stuck at its current level of accuracy. The actionable recommendations provided above are designed to shift the trend towards **improvement**.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script employs a multi-stage LLM-driven approach using chain-of-thought prompting for question answering, involving analysis, extraction, generation, and verification. The problem is decomposed into four key functions: `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer`, each acting as a specialized agent with specific instructions. The `call_llm` function facilitates interaction with the Gemini model using a system instruction and prompt. The workflow involves sequentially calling these functions, passing the output of one as input to the next, with a final verification step to refine the answer.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Buccaneers and Panthers met for the first time this season, with first place in the NFC South on the line. Carolina starting quarterback Jake Delhomme sat out the game with an elbow injury, and was replaced by David Carr. The Buccaneer offense started the game with an exhausting, 11-play, 71-yard drive, capped off by a 3-yard scramble by Jeff Garcia for a touchdown. With 3 minutes left in the first quarter, running back Carnell Williams blasted down the field for an 18-yard run, but his right leg buckled, seriously injuring his knee. As he was being carted off the field, nearly the entire Buccaneers team, along with several Panthers players, huddled around Williams in support. After the injury timeout, Earnest Graham salvaged the drive with a one-yard touchdown run. Tampa Bay extended their halftime lead to 17-0 after a Matt Bryant field goal, meanwhile, Carolina's offense was sputtering, blasted by the Buccaneers defense, who sacked Carr three times, and intercepeted him once. Carr completed only 19 of 41 pass attempts, and Carolina was facing their first shutout in five seasons. With 23 seconds left in regulation, Carolina finally got on the board with a touchdown pass to DeAngelo Williams. An onside kick was unsuccessful, and the Buccaneers won their third straight game. Through four games, the Buccaneers had not given up any points in the first quarter, and quarterback Jeff Garcia had not thrown an interception. After the game, the Buccaneers announced that running back Carnell Williams (torn patellar ligament) and left tackle Luke Petitgout (torn ACL) would both face season-ending surgery.

In the first quarter, the Steelers scored when Shaun Suisham nailed a 49-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead for the only score.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Hoping to rebound from their last-second road loss to the Steelers, the Browns flew to M&T Bank Stadium for an AFC North rematch with the Baltimore Ravens. In the first quarter, Cleveland drew first blood as kicker Phil Dawson managed to get a 28-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Browns increased its lead as RB Jamal Lewis (in his first game back in Baltimore) managed to get a 1-yard touchdown. The Ravens managed to get on the board with LB Ray Lewis returning an interception 35&#160;yards for a touchdown. Fortunately, Cleveland responded with Dawson kicking a 39-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Baltimore took the lead with RB Willis McGahee getting a 2-yard TD run. Fortunately, the Browns replied with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run, while Safety Brodney Pool returned an interception 100&#160;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, the Ravens tied the game with kicker Matt Stover (a former Brown) managed to kick a 34-yard & a 41-yard field goal, while QB Kyle Boller completed a 27-yard TD pass to WR Devard Darling. Afterwards, Baltimore retook the lead with Stover kicking a 47-yard field goal. Cleveland tried to make a comeback, as they managed to get into field goal range. Initially, Dawson's 51-yard attempt was ruled no good. However, it turns out that the ball bounced off the left upright, went in, bounced off the support bar behind the crossbar, and then went back over the crossbar and onto the field. In the end, the Browns were awarded the field goal, tying the score at 30-30 and sending the game to overtime. In overtime, Cleveland sealed the Ravens' fate as Dawson nailed the game-winning 33-yard field goal. With the win, not only did the Browns improve to 6-4, but it also marked the first time since 2001 that Cleveland swept Baltimore.

On Wednesday, October 3, linebacker Barrett Ruud was named the NFC Defensive Player of Month for September with a league-leading 51 tackles, three forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries, and one interception.",

In the first quarter, the Steelers scored when Shaun Suisham nailed a 49-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead for the only score.  They increased their lead when Suisham kicked a 31-yard field goal for a 6-0 game.  The Saints took the lead as Drew Brees found Benjamein Watson on a 15-yard TD pass for a 7-6 game.  This was followed up by Brees finding Eric Long on a 4-yard pass for a 14-6 halftime lead.  After the break, the Saints got back to work as Brees found Nick Toon on an 11-yard TD pass to go ahead 21-6.  The Steelers were able to pull within 8 as Le'Veon Bell ran for a 1-yard TD for a 21-13 game.  The Saints pulled away as Brees found Kenny Stills on a 69-yard TD pass for a 28-13 game.  In the 4th quarter, the Steelers scored another field goal thanks to Suisham kicking it from 47 yards out for a 28-16 game.  However, the Saints pulled away as Brees hooked up with Marques Coltson on a 3-yard TD pass for a 35-16 game.  Ben Roethlisberger would throw his 2 touchdowns of the whole game both to Antonio Brown as time expired from 4 and 3 yards out with successful 2-point conversions tacked on with scores of 35-24 and a final score of 35-32.",

      "original_passage": "Hoping to rebound from their last-second road loss to the Steelers, the Browns flew to M&T Bank Stadium for an AFC North rematch with the Baltimore Ravens. In the first quarter, Cleveland drew first blood as kicker Phil Dawson managed to get a 28-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Browns increased its lead as RB Jamal Lewis (in his first game back in Baltimore) managed to get a 1-yard touchdown. The Ravens managed to get on the board with LB Ray Lewis returning an interception 35&#160;yards for a touchdown. Fortunately, Cleveland responded with Dawson kicking a 39-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Baltimore took the lead with RB Willis McGahee getting a 2-yard TD run. Fortunately, the Browns replied with QB Derek Anderson getting a 1-yard TD run, while Safety Brodney Pool returned an interception 100&#160;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, the Ravens tied the game with kicker Matt Stover (a former Brown) managed to kick a 34-yard & a 41-yard field goal, while QB Kyle Boller completed a 27-yard TD pass to WR Devard Darling. Afterwards, Baltimore retook the lead with Stover kicking a 47-yard field goal. Cleveland tried to make a comeback, as they managed to get into field goal range. Initially, Dawson's 51-yard attempt was ruled no good. However, it turns out that the ball bounced off the left upright, went in, bounced off the support bar behind the crossbar, and then went back over the crossbar and onto the field. In the end, the Browns were awarded the field goal, tying the score at 30-30 and sending the game to overtime. In overtime, Cleveland sealed the Ravens' fate as Dawson nailed the game-winning 33-yard field goal. With the win, not only did the Browns improve to 6-4, but it also marked the first time since 2001 that Cleveland swept Baltimore. WR/KR/PR Josh Cribbs became the 3rd NFL player since the AFL-NFL merger of 1970 to have 300+ return yards in one game.",

This is a critical failure.\n*   **Sample 2:** The output \"0\" indicates a potential attempt to answer a counting question but failed in some way as the correct answer was not identified, potentially missing the question constraints.\n*   **Sample 3:** The output \"4\" could indicate that it successfully extracted numbers, but was unsuccessful in correctly answering the prompt.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities. While it exhibits a rudimentary ability to extract some numerical data and identify entities (as noted in the strengths), its performance is severely hampered by arithmetic errors, failure to follow instructions, difficulty in counting, and problems with answer selection. The system is unreliable and requires significant improvements before it can be considered functional.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Numerical Data Extraction:** The system can identify and extract numerical data from the passage.\n*   **Entity Recognition:** The system shows some capacity for recognizing entities and their associated actions.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system consistently fails at basic arithmetic operations.\n*   **Instruction Following:** The system struggles to adhere to complex instructions and implicit constraints.\n*   **Counting Accuracy:** Counting specific instances accurately is a major challenge.\n*   **Answer Selection:** The system struggles to correctly select the answer after extraction of information.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Arithmetic Reasoning**. Without accurate calculation, the system cannot successfully answer questions that require aggregating or manipulating numerical data, which appears to be a common requirement. Alongside this, work should also be done to improve **Answer Selection** abilities.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement the Arithmetic Module:** Develop and integrate a dedicated arithmetic module (e.g., a Python function) that receives numbers and operations as input and returns the calculated result. Thoroughly test this module in isolation to ensure its accuracy.\n2.  **Explicit Constraint Processing:** Before any numerical processing, implement a step to explicitly identify and validate all constraints mentioned in the question. Use code or prompt engineering to enforce these constraints on the extracted data.\n3.  **Detailed Intermediate Calculation Logging:** Add logging to record all intermediate calculations performed by the system. Log not just the inputs and outputs of the arithmetic module but also any data transformations or aggregations that occur before the calculation.\n4.  **Enhanced Counting Algorithm Review:** Review and refine the algorithms used for counting instances. Consider incorporating regular expressions or other pattern-matching techniques to improve accuracy.\n5.  **Post-Extraction Answer Selection:** Implement a step that will correctly select the answer after extraction of information from the passage.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the current accuracy of 20%, the capability trend is currently **stable but critically low**. Without the recommended improvements, the system will remain unusable. The immediate focus should be on implementing the recommendations and then re-evaluating the performance.\n",

This is a critical failure.\n*   **Sample 2:** The output \"0\" indicates a potential attempt to answer a counting question but failed in some way as the correct answer was not identified, potentially missing the question constraints.\n*   **Sample 3:** The output \"4\" could indicate that it successfully extracted numbers, but was unsuccessful in correctly answering the prompt.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities. While it exhibits a rudimentary ability to extract some numerical data and identify entities (as noted in the strengths), its performance is severely hampered by arithmetic errors, failure to follow instructions, difficulty in counting, and problems with answer selection. The system is unreliable and requires significant improvements before it can be considered functional.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Numerical Data Extraction:** The system can identify and extract numerical data from the passage.\n*   **Entity Recognition:** The system shows some capacity for recognizing entities and their associated actions.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system consistently fails at basic arithmetic operations.\n*   **Instruction Following:** The system struggles to adhere to complex instructions and implicit constraints.\n*   **Counting Accuracy:** Counting specific instances accurately is a major challenge.\n*   **Answer Selection:** The system struggles to correctly select the answer after extraction of information.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Arithmetic Reasoning**. Without accurate calculation, the system cannot successfully answer questions that require aggregating or manipulating numerical data, which appears to be a common requirement. Alongside this, work should also be done to improve **Answer Selection** abilities.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement the Arithmetic Module:** Develop and integrate a dedicated arithmetic module (e.g., a Python function) that receives numbers and operations as input and returns the calculated result. Thoroughly test this module in isolation to ensure its accuracy.\n2.  **Explicit Constraint Processing:** Before any numerical processing, implement a step to explicitly identify and validate all constraints mentioned in the question. Use code or prompt engineering to enforce these constraints on the extracted data.\n3.  **Detailed Intermediate Calculation Logging:** Add logging to record all intermediate calculations performed by the system. Log not just the inputs and outputs of the arithmetic module but also any data transformations or aggregations that occur before the calculation.\n4.  **Enhanced Counting Algorithm Review:** Review and refine the algorithms used for counting instances. Consider incorporating regular expressions or other pattern-matching techniques to improve accuracy.\n5.  **Post-Extraction Answer Selection:** Implement a step that will correctly select the answer after extraction of information from the passage.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the current accuracy of 20%, the capability trend is currently **stable but critically low**. Without the recommended improvements, the system will remain unusable. The immediate focus should be on implementing the recommendations and then re-evaluating the performance.\n"

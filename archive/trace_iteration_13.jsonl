The transformation relies on spatial relationships between numbers in the input grid. Let's denote 5, 1, 8, 6 as special numbers. The core idea seems to be moving these numbers and summing them up to produce the output grid. For example, if a 5 and a 1 is next to each other, they can sum up to 6 (or 1+1=2) in the output.\nIn Example 1: the numbers [5, 1] are horizontally compressed. 5 is eliminated, and number 1 is next to number 2, which produces a sum of 3 in the output grid.\nIn Example 2: numbers [5, 1, 5] are horizontally compressed.\nIn Example 3: number 5 is eliminated, and number 8 is shifted.\nIn Example 4: numbers [5, 1] are horizontally compressed.

The numbers `5, 1, 5, 5, 8` might be transformed to other values in the first row of the output. The numbers `2, 2, 1, 5, 3, 8` might be transformed to other values in the second row of the output.

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) were explicitly present in the provided outputs. The errors stemmed from logical reasoning failures rather than technical execution problems.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Grid Comprehension:** The system can generally understand the grid structure and identify the values within it.\n*   **Pattern Following (in successful cases):** When the pattern is straightforward, the system can replicate it accurately. This is demonstrated in success case 2.\n*   **Code Generation:** The system attempts to codify the pattern. In the error case 1, a code definition is returned, albeit incorrect in this specific implementation.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to identify complex, non-trivial patterns in the grid transformations. It often misses subtle changes or relationships between input and output grids.\n*   **Generalization:** Even when patterns are partially identified, the system fails to generalize them effectively to the test input, leading to incorrect transformations.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The system lacks robust spatial reasoning capabilities to understand how elements are positioned and relate to each other within the grid.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Complex Pattern Deduction:** The system's ability to deduce complex or subtle patterns in grid transformations is a major bottleneck. It appears to rely on simple pattern matching rather than a deeper understanding of spatial relationships and element transformations.\n*   **Effective Constraint Handling:** The examples require the system to determine constraints, but the system struggles to do so. It then struggles to apply them to the transformations.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Transformations:** The most common pattern is the generation of completely incorrect transformations, often resulting in grids of the wrong size or with misplaced elements.\n*   **Over-Simplification:** The system tends to over-simplify the transformation rules, applying basic or incomplete rules that don't capture the full complexity of the pattern. Error case 1 shows the system applying a simple row based transformation, ignoring complex spatial relationships.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inadequate capacity to learn and apply complex patterns involving spatial relationships and element transformations in grid-based problems. The system cannot accurately deduce the underlying rules governing the transformations in the training examples and struggles to translate it into an accurate grid transformation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Enhanced Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's ability to recognize and represent complex patterns, including spatial arrangements and element relationships. This might involve incorporating techniques from computer vision or spatial reasoning.\n*   **Robust Transformation Generalization:** Enhance the system's generalization capabilities to apply learned patterns to new inputs accurately, avoiding over-simplification or misapplication of rules.\n*   **Constraint Deduction:** Improve the system's ability to identify constraints present in the example transforms.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Spatial Reasoning Module:** Implement a dedicated module for spatial reasoning, capable of analyzing grid layouts, identifying shapes, and understanding spatial relationships between elements.\n*   **Pattern Encoding:** Explore techniques for encoding patterns in a more structured and expressive way, allowing for more complex transformations to be represented. Consider using graph representations or symbolic representations.\n*   **Augmented Training Data:** Increase the diversity and complexity of training examples to expose the system to a wider range of patterns and transformations.\n*   **Intermediate Representation Visualization:** Introduce intermediate representations (e.g., heatmaps showing the frequency of value occurrences at different positions, or dependency graphs highlighting relationships between grid cells).\n*   **Introduce Print Statements:** Add print statements that allows intermediate outputs to be viewed. This will allow a developer to step-by-step reproduce why the system went wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to correctly extract the transformation logic\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed to identify and encode size and value constraints\n    *   solution_generation: Generated a grid of the wrong size with incorrect values.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to correctly extract the transformation logic\n    *   solution_generation: The generated grid transformations were incorrect.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the solution's alignment to the pattern, and the output's validity to the original example's specifications.\n",

The sizes do not match in the input and output.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The Python code defines a transformation function, but it implements a very simplistic and incorrect transformation (setting values based on row number). The resulting grid is therefore drastically different from the expected output, again with mismatched dimensions.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates limited capabilities in solving grid transformation problems.  While it can generally understand the grid structure, its ability to identify and apply complex patterns is severely lacking. The overall accuracy of 0.33 highlights the need for substantial improvements. The outputs suggest a system that struggles to connect the input and output grids through any meaningful, learned transformation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Grid Comprehension:** Can process input grids and produce output grids, avoiding runtime errors related to data types or structure.\n*   **Code Generation (Attempt):**  The system attempts to generate code that represents the transformation (though the code is often incorrect). This provides a basis for improvement.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The system fails to recognize complex, spatial patterns and generalize them to new input grids. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Constraint Deduction:** It struggles to determine and apply size and value constraints from the example transforms.\n*   **Lack of Spatial Reasoning:** Limited ability to understand spatial relationships between elements within the grid.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**.  Without the ability to accurately identify and generalize patterns, the system cannot effectively solve these types of problems.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Spatial Reasoning Module:** Develop and integrate a dedicated module for spatial reasoning. This module should be responsible for analyzing grid layouts, identifying shapes, understanding spatial relationships (adjacency, symmetry, containment, etc.), and encoding these relationships in a structured manner.\n    *   **Action:** Research and prototype spatial reasoning techniques suitable for grid-based problems (e.g., convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, symbolic reasoning).\n    *   **Metric:** Measure the module's ability to correctly identify and encode spatial relationships in a test set of grid patterns.\n2.  **Improve Pattern Encoding:**  Explore and implement more expressive ways to encode patterns. Instead of relying on simple transformations (as seen in the erroneous code generation), use representations that can capture complex relationships and constraints.\n    *   **Action:**  Investigate graph-based representations or symbolic representations for encoding patterns. Experiment with different graph structures and symbolic languages.\n    *   **Metric:** Assess the ability of the pattern encoding to accurately represent a diverse set of grid transformations.\n3.  **Augment Training Data with Specific Examples Targeting Weaknesses:**  Create training examples specifically designed to address the system's weaknesses in pattern recognition and generalization.\n    *   **Action:**  Generate examples with complex spatial relationships, subtle transformations, and varying constraints.\n    *   **Metric:** Track the system's performance on the augmented training data, focusing on the targeted weaknesses.\n4.  **Introduce Intermediate Representation Visualization with Print Statements:**  Implement the generation and visualization of intermediate representations (e.g., heatmaps showing the frequency of value occurrences at different positions, or dependency graphs highlighting relationships between grid cells). Insert print statements that print to standard output.\n    *   **Action:**  Modify the system to generate these intermediate representations during processing and use print statements to surface them.\n    *   **Metric:** Evaluate the usefulness of the intermediate representations in debugging and understanding the system's reasoning process by manually inspecting the system's printed output.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the capability trend is currently **Stable/Potentially Declining**.  The accuracy is low, and the errors indicate a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem domain. Without significant improvements in pattern recognition and generalization, the system's performance is unlikely to improve. The potential decline stems from the fact that the naive approaches are likely to be exhausted, and more sophisticated methods are necessary.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach, leveraging techniques like question analysis and answer verification, to address a question. It decomposes the problem into identifying the question type and keywords, extracting relevant information, generating an initial answer, and then verifying the answer's correctness. The agent roles are implicitly defined within each function's prompt engineering (e.g., \"expert at analyzing questions\").\n\nThe functions used are `main`, `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, `verify_answer`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `analyze_question` to understand the question, `extract_relevant_passage` to find relevant context, `generate_answer` to create an initial answer, and `verify_answer` to validate it. The `call_llm` function is used by all other functions to interface with the Gemini model by Google.\n\nThe overall workflow starts with a question, proceeds through analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, verification, and returns the final verified answer, using the LLM at each stage.",

Chad Morton then returned a punt to the Eagle 21 and Tiki Barber scored from 11 yards out giving New York an early lead.  After Philadelphia converted a third and 11, quarterback Jeff Garcia drove his team the length of field and Correll Buckhalter tied the game.  The Giants offense, although moving well, was hurt by several penalties and fumbles by Visanthe Shiancoe and Brandon Jacobs. The Eagles went ahead 14-7 with a one-yard run by Brian Westbrook on fourth down, and the Giants added a Jay Feely field goal to make it 14-10 at the recess. The Giants had several opportunities to take command in the second half, but red zone difficulties, similar to those experienced against the Cowboys in week 13, hurt their chances.  Eli Manning hit Plaxico Burress in stride for a big gain to get inside the 10, but were forced to settle for a field goal. After forcing a fumble on the ensuing Eagles possession, the Giants had the ball first and goal from the seven-yard line, but two runs and a pass yielded zero yards and Feely kicked another short field goal, putting the Giants ahead 16-14. The Eagles came right back as Reno Mahe returned the ensuing kick 64 yards for Philadelphia. Westbrook then ran through a gaping hole 28 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles' next drive ended with an interception by Giants cornerback Will Demps. The Giants took advantage on a drive culminating with a Jacobs score from one yard out.  After the score, the Giants went for the two-point conversion, but were denied on a draw play, leaving the score 22-21 with seven minutes remaining. Garcia responded swiftly by driving his squad 80 yards in eight plays; an 18-yard strike to Reggie Brown and a conversion put the Eagles up seven.  Manning was then intercepted on the following drive for an insurance touchdown by Trent Cole, ostensibly putting the game away for Philadelphia. For the game, the Eagles 31st-ranked rush defense held the Giants to 88 net running yards, Manning threw for 282 yards on 28 of 40 passing, Burress recorded 120 receiving yards and Jeremy Shockey had eight receptions for 70 yards. Carlos Emmons and Will Demps recorded the only sacks for the Giants.  For Philadelphia, Jeff Garcia continued his surprising rebirth, completing 19 of 28 passes for 237 yards and one touchdown (along with one interception), and Brian Westbrook gained over 140 total yards while scoring a touchdown.\n\nQUESTION: How many receiving yards did Shockey and Burress have combined?",

Eli Manning hit Plaxico Burress in stride for a big gain to get inside the 10, but were forced to settle for a field goal. After forcing a fumble on the ensuing Eagles possession, the Giants had the ball first and goal from the seven-yard line, but two runs and a pass yielded zero yards and Feely kicked another short field goal, putting the Giants ahead 16-14. The Eagles came right back as Reno Mahe returned the ensuing kick 64 yards for Philadelphia. Westbrook then ran through a gaping hole 28 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles' next drive ended with an interception by Giants cornerback Will Demps. The Giants took advantage on a drive culminating with a Jacobs score from one yard out.  After the score, the Giants went for the two-point conversion, but were denied on a draw play, leaving the score 22-21 with seven minutes remaining. Garcia responded swiftly by driving his squad 80 yards in eight plays; an 18-yard strike to Reggie Brown and a conversion put the Eagles up seven.  Manning was then intercepted on the following drive for an insurance touchdown by Trent Cole, ostensibly putting the game away for Philadelphia. For the game, the Eagles 31st-ranked rush defense held the Giants to 88 net running yards, Manning threw for 282 yards on 28 of 40 passing, Burress recorded 120 receiving yards and Jeremy Shockey had eight receptions for 70 yards. Carlos Emmons and Will Demps recorded the only sacks for the Giants.  For Philadelphia, Jeff Garcia continued his surprising rebirth, completing 19 of 28 passes for 237 yards and one touchdown (along with one interception), and Brian Westbrook gained over 140 total yards while scoring a touchdown.",

Manchu Generals and Bannermen were put to shame by the performance of the Han Chinese Green Standard Army, who fought better than them against the rebels. The Qing had the support of the majority of Han Chinese soldiers and the Han elite, as they did not join the Three Feudatories. Different sources offer different account of the Han and Manchu forces deployed against the rebels. According to one, 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers and 150,000 Bannermen served on the Qing side during the war. according to another, 213 Han Chinese Banner companies, and 527 companies of Mongol and Manchu Banners were mobilized by the Qing. According to a third, mustered the Qing a massive army of more than 900,000 Han Chinese to fight the Three Feudatories. Fighting in northwestern China against Wang Fuchen, the Qing put Bannermen in the rear as reserves while they used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese Generals like Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao, and Zhang Yong as their main military force. The Qing thought that Han Chinese soldiers were superior at fighting other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as their main army against the rebels instead of Bannermen. As a result, after 1676, the tide turned in favor of the Qing forces. In the northwest, Wang Fuchen surrendered after a three-year-long stalemate, while Geng Jingzhong and Shang Zhixin surrendered in turn as their forces weakened.",

The output shows no signs of hallucination, it simply picked the less optimal answer.  The formatting (ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END) is adhered to, showing consistency.\n\n*   **Sample ID: 1 (Success):** The system accurately performs the subtraction and provides a clear explanation of the steps taken, along with verification, which is excellent.\n\n*   **Sample ID: 2 & 3 (Success - from performance summary):** The sample shows that the system can correctly extract a single number and format it into the answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a solid foundation in numerical reasoning, direct fact extraction, and adherence to specified output formats. However, its semantic understanding, especially regarding hierarchical relationships between concepts like titles and roles, is a significant limitation. The system can be considered competent for simple extraction and arithmetic, but inadequate for questions requiring deeper semantic analysis and contextual reasoning.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Numerical Reasoning and Calculation:**  Accurately performs calculations when required.\n*   **Direct Fact Extraction:** Reliably extracts numerical facts explicitly stated in the passage.\n*   **Output Formatting:**  Consistently adheres to the specified output format (ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END).\n*   **Provides reasoning:** Shows intermediate steps.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Semantic Understanding and Hierarchical Reasoning:** Struggles to differentiate between general and specific titles/roles.\n*   **Contextual Reasoning:** Limited ability to use context to identify the most relevant and specific answer.\n*   **Lack of Deep Semantic Reasoning:** Inability to process nuanced information beyond surface-level extraction and basic calculations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Semantic Understanding and Hierarchical Reasoning**, particularly the ability to discriminate between general and specific terms.  Addressing this will directly impact the system's ability to answer questions accurately when they require identifying the most specific piece of information from a given context.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Curated Fine-tuning Dataset:**\n    *   Create a dataset specifically designed to highlight the difference between general and specific titles, roles, and other hierarchical relationships.  Each example should contain a passage, a question requiring the identification of the most specific term, and the correct answer.  Include negative examples where the system might be tempted to choose a more general term.  This curated fine-tuning data should have roughly 50-100 examples.\n\n2.  **Implement a Title/Role Specificity Scoring Mechanism:**\n    *   Before selecting an answer, implement a \"specificity score\" for each candidate answer. This score could be based on factors such as:\n        *   Presence of modifiers or qualifiers (e.g., \"Lord *of Arabistan*\" is more specific than \"Emir\").\n        *   Frequency of the term in the context (more frequent and relevant terms are often more specific).\n        *   Comparison against a pre-defined knowledge base or ontology of titles/roles (if available).\n    *   The system should then prioritize the answer with the highest specificity score.\n\n3.  **Enhance Question Understanding with Relation Extraction:**\n    *   Before attempting to extract the answer, analyze the question to identify the *type* of information being requested (e.g., \"title,\" \"role,\" \"amount\").  This can be achieved through relation extraction. Use this identified information to prioritize specific terms of that type in the answer selection process. For example, if the question asks for a \"title,\" prioritize candidate answers that the relation extraction module identifies as titles.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the initial performance data and error analysis, the system's capabilities are currently **stable** in its strengths (numerical reasoning, fact extraction) but **stagnant** in its weaknesses (semantic understanding).  Implementing the actionable recommendations above should lead to an **improving** trend in overall capabilities. The trend should be monitored after each iteration.\n",

It correctly identifies a title, but fails to identify the *most specific* title requested by the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Enhanced Semantic Understanding:** Improve the system's ability to understand the semantic relationships between different titles and roles.\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to reason about the context of the passage to identify the most relevant and specific answer.\n3.  **Answer Selection Heuristics:** Develop heuristics for prioritizing more specific answers over more general ones when the question requires identifying a particular title or role.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Fine-tuning with examples that highlight the difference between general and specific titles:** Provide the model with training data emphasizing the difference between broad job titles and specific roles, including examples where selecting the \"most specific\" answer is the key to correctness.\n2.  **Implement a title/role hierarchy:** Incorporate a knowledge base or ontology of titles and roles, allowing the system to recognize hierarchical relationships and select the most specific title.\n3.  **Add a \"specificity scoring\" mechanism:** When multiple candidate answers are identified, evaluate each answer's specificity based on the context and prioritize the most specific answer. For example, count tokens in both the question and the answer that are relevant to \"specificity.\"\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID: 0**\n    *   Failed capability: information_extraction, decision_making. The system extracted \"Emir\", but failed to recognize and select \"Lord of Arabistan\" as the more specific and correct answer. The decision-making process failed to select the optimal response.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System Assessment\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.80 (4/5)\n*   Error samples: 1/5\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:** (Provided by the user)\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided `SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS` confirm the error analysis and highlight some important patterns:\n\n*   **Sample ID: 0 (Error):** The system confidently extracts \"Emir\" but fails to recognize \"Lord of Arabistan\" as the more specific title, illustrating a clear weakness in distinguishing between general and specific roles. The output shows no signs of hallucination, it simply picked the less optimal answer.  The formatting (ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END) is adhered to, showing consistency.\n\n*   **Sample ID: 1 (Success):** The system accurately performs the subtraction and provides a clear explanation of the steps taken, along with verification, which is excellent.\n\n*   **Sample ID: 2 & 3 (Success - from performance summary):** The sample shows that the system can correctly extract a single number and format it into the answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a solid foundation in numerical reasoning, direct fact extraction, and adherence to specified output formats. However, its semantic understanding, especially regarding hierarchical relationships between concepts like titles and roles, is a significant limitation. The system can be considered competent for simple extraction and arithmetic, but inadequate for questions requiring deeper semantic analysis and contextual reasoning.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Numerical Reasoning and Calculation:**  Accurately performs calculations when required.\n*   **Direct Fact Extraction:** Reliably extracts numerical facts explicitly stated in the passage.\n*   **Output Formatting:**  Consistently adheres to the specified output format (ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END).\n*   **Provides reasoning:** Shows intermediate steps.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Semantic Understanding and Hierarchical Reasoning:** Struggles to differentiate between general and specific titles/roles.\n*   **Contextual Reasoning:** Limited ability to use context to identify the most relevant and specific answer.\n*   **Lack of Deep Semantic Reasoning:** Inability to process nuanced information beyond surface-level extraction and basic calculations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Semantic Understanding and Hierarchical Reasoning**, particularly the ability to discriminate between general and specific terms.  Addressing this will directly impact the system's ability to answer questions accurately when they require identifying the most specific piece of information from a given context.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Curated Fine-tuning Dataset:**\n    *   Create a dataset specifically designed to highlight the difference between general and specific titles, roles, and other hierarchical relationships.  Each example should contain a passage, a question requiring the identification of the most specific term, and the correct answer.  Include negative examples where the system might be tempted to choose a more general term.  This curated fine-tuning data should have roughly 50-100 examples.\n\n2.  **Implement a Title/Role Specificity Scoring Mechanism:**\n    *   Before selecting an answer, implement a \"specificity score\" for each candidate answer. This score could be based on factors such as:\n        *   Presence of modifiers or qualifiers (e.g., \"Lord *of Arabistan*\" is more specific than \"Emir\").\n        *   Frequency of the term in the context (more frequent and relevant terms are often more specific).\n        *   Comparison against a pre-defined knowledge base or ontology of titles/roles (if available).\n    *   The system should then prioritize the answer with the highest specificity score.\n\n3.  **Enhance Question Understanding with Relation Extraction:**\n    *   Before attempting to extract the answer, analyze the question to identify the *type* of information being requested (e.g., \"title,\" \"role,\" \"amount\").  This can be achieved through relation extraction. Use this identified information to prioritize specific terms of that type in the answer selection process. For example, if the question asks for a \"title,\" prioritize candidate answers that the relation extraction module identifies as titles.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the initial performance data and error analysis, the system's capabilities are currently **stable** in its strengths (numerical reasoning, fact extraction) but **stagnant** in its weaknesses (semantic understanding).  Implementing the actionable recommendations above should lead to an **improving** trend in overall capabilities. The trend should be monitored after each iteration.\n"

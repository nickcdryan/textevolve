  "approach_summary": "This script uses a \"Chain of Knowledge\" approach, iteratively refining information through LLM calls with Adaptive Source Selection. The problem is decomposed into source selection, information retrieval, verification, and answer extraction, each handled by a specialized agent. The workflow involves `select_source` to choose a source, `retrieve_information` to get data, `verify_information` to ensure accuracy, and `extract_answer` to provide a concise response, using `call_llm` for all LLM interactions. The main function orchestrates this process, printing debug information and returning the final answer.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors (like JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are found in the provided 'output' fields.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1. **Reliable Source Selection:** The system consistently selects sources that are generally considered reliable for the type of information requested (e.g., Billboard Magazine Archives for music industry history, Who's Who in Italy for biographical information, Trusted Reviews for technology reviews).\n2. **Valid Verification:** The verification step correctly identifies the information retrieved from the source as directly relating to the question. It labels the retrieved information as VALID, indicating that the system successfully found a statement answering the question.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Poor Answer Extraction/Synthesis:** The system frequently fails to extract the specific piece of information (e.g., a year, a numerical value) that directly answers the question, instead often returning the name of the source itself or a more general description.\n2. **Lack of Granularity in Information Retrieval:** The system retrieves information but struggles to pinpoint the *precise* answer within that information. It accepts the \"retrieved info\" field as the final answer, even when it's not the most specific response.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Answer Extraction Logic:** The primary bottleneck is the logic responsible for extracting the final answer from the retrieved information. The current system appears to accept the *source of information* as the *information itself*, leading to incorrect answers.\n2. **Lack of Answer Type Awareness:** The system does not seem to be considering the expected answer type (e.g., year, number) when extracting the final answer from the retrieved information. This lack of \"awareness\" allows it to return source names instead of the required data types.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Source as Answer:** The most prevalent error is providing the *source* of information (e.g., \"Billboard Magazine archives\", \"Who's Who in Italy\") as the answer, rather than the actual data the user is requesting (e.g., \"1991\", \"2006\").\n2. **Numerical Value Mismatch:** When a numerical answer is expected, the system sometimes provides a *related* numerical value but not the *correct* one (e.g., \"840 nits\" instead of \"1200 nits\").\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **failure to accurately extract the specific, desired information from the retrieved text**, particularly when the answer should be a specific data type such as a year or a numerical value. The system stops at finding a relevant passage, but it doesn't have the necessary logic to pinpoint and return the *exact* answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Answer Extraction:** Improve the answer extraction logic to specifically identify and isolate the exact piece of information that directly answers the question, rather than simply providing the source or related text.\n2. **Answer Type Validation:** Implement answer type validation to ensure the extracted answer matches the expected data type (e.g., year, number, string). The system needs to *know* that if the question asks for a year, it must return a year and not a source name.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Introduce Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Implement NER to identify specific entities in the retrieved information (dates, numbers, organizations, etc.). This can help the system identify potential answers and prioritize them.\n2. **Implement Question-Specific Answer Parsing:** Tailor the answer parsing logic to the specific question type. For example, if the question contains \"in what year,\" the system should focus on extracting a year from the retrieved information.\n3. **Develop a Post-Processing Step:** Implement a post-processing step that checks the extracted answer against the question and the retrieved information to ensure it is both relevant and accurate. This step could also include a \"data type validation\" check.\n4. **Fine-tune the Verification Step:** Make the verification step more robust. The current \"VALID\" label might be too lenient. Verification should not only check if the retrieved information is *related* but also if it contains the *exact answer*.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed - Did not extract the specific year.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Generated an incorrect answer (source name).\n    *   solution_verification: Partially Failed - Verified that the source was relevant, but didn't check for the correctness of the extracted answer.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed - Extracted the wrong numerical value.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Generated an incorrect answer (numerical value).\n    *   solution_verification: Partially Failed - Verified that the source was relevant, but didn't check for the correctness of the extracted numerical value.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed - Did not extract the specific year.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Generated an incorrect answer (source name).\n    *   solution_verification: Partially Failed - Verified that the source was relevant, but didn't check for the correctness of the extracted answer.\n",

The system consistently demonstrates the following:\n\n*   **Correct Source Selection:** The sources chosen are appropriate for the questions asked. Trusted Reviews for phone specs, Billboard for music history, and Who's Who for biographical information are all valid choices.\n*   **Superficial Verification:** The \"Verification\" step correctly identifies the *relevance* of the retrieved information to the question, labeling it as \"VALID.\" However, it fails to check if the extracted answer is the *precise* and *correct* answer. The verification step seems focused solely on source relevance and a broad connection between the source and question.\n*   **Failed Answer Extraction:** The most glaring issue is the poor answer extraction. In two instances, the system returns the *source* as the answer (e.g., \"Billboard Magazine archives\" instead of \"1973\"). In the numerical value question, it returns a related but incorrect number (840 nits instead of 1200 nits, although the target value isn't explicitly present in the snippets, the system's answer still should have been \"unknown\", not a related value). The system demonstrates a clear inability to pinpoint the specific piece of information required to answer the question.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system exhibits a fundamental flaw in its ability to extract the *precise* answer from relevant information. While it can identify appropriate sources and retrieve related text, it fails to isolate the specific data point required to answer the question. The accuracy score of 0.00 (0/3) reflects this core deficiency. The system demonstrates strength in source retrieval and relevance but falls drastically short in information extraction and validation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Reliable Source Selection:** The system's ability to identify and select credible sources for different types of questions is a significant strength. This foundation is crucial for building a reliable AI system.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Precise Answer Extraction:** The inability to extract the *precise* answer from retrieved information is the most critical weakness. This flaw undermines the entire system's utility, as it consistently provides incorrect or incomplete answers.\n*   **Lack of Data Type Awareness:** The system's failure to consider the expected data type (year, number, string) when extracting the answer contributes significantly to the poor accuracy. It treats all retrieved information equally, regardless of whether it matches the question's required data type.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Precise Answer Extraction**. Without this, the system's other strengths are rendered largely irrelevant. The system needs to identify and isolate the exact piece of information that answers the question and validate that it matches the expected data type.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Targeted Information Extraction Module:** Replace the current answer extraction logic with a module that uses more sophisticated techniques, such as:\n    *   **Keyword-Based Extraction:** Focus on extracting text surrounding keywords from the question. For example, if the question contains \"in what year,\" prioritize extracting 4-digit numbers.\n    *   **Regular Expression (Regex) Matching:** Use regex to identify patterns that match the expected answer type. For example, `\\d{4}` for years, `\\d+\\.?\\d*` for numbers.\n    *   **Sentence Segmentation:** Split the retrieved information into sentences and prioritize sentences containing keywords or matching the expected data type.\n\n2.  **Introduce Answer Type Validation:** Implement a function that validates the extracted answer against the expected data type.\n    *   **Data Type Inference:** Determine the expected data type based on the question's wording (e.g., \"when\" implies a date/year, \"how many\" implies a number).\n    *   **Type Checking:** Check if the extracted answer is a valid data type. If the question asks for a year, ensure the extracted answer is a valid year (e.g., an integer between 1000 and the current year).\n    *   **Fallback Mechanism:** If a valid answer of the expected type cannot be found, return a \"not found\" or \"unknown\" response instead of an incorrect answer.\n\n3.  **Refine the Verification Step:** The verification step must be more than just a check for source relevance. It needs to verify that the extracted answer is not only *related* but also *correct*.\n    *   **Answer-Specific Verification:** The verification step should include a check to ensure that the extracted answer is actually present in the retrieved information and that it directly answers the question.\n    *   **Confidence Scoring:** Introduce a confidence score for the extracted answer based on the strength of the evidence supporting it in the retrieved information.\n\n4.  **Enhance Sample Data and Training:** Augment the training data with examples specifically designed to address the answer extraction problem.\n    *   **Negative Examples:** Include examples where the retrieved information is relevant but does not contain the correct answer. The system should be trained to identify and handle these cases gracefully.\n    *   **Data Augmentation:** Create variations of existing training examples by changing the wording of the question or the structure of the retrieved information.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable but critically low**. Without significant improvements in answer extraction, the system's performance will remain unacceptable. The current state requires focused development to achieve any measurable improvement.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors (like JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are found in the provided 'output' fields.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1. **Reliable Source Selection:** The system consistently selects sources that are generally considered reliable for the type of information requested (e.g., Billboard Magazine Archives for music industry history, Who's Who in Italy for biographical information, Trusted Reviews for technology reviews).\n2. **Valid Verification:** The verification step correctly identifies the information retrieved from the source as directly relating to the question. It labels the retrieved information as VALID, indicating that the system successfully found a statement answering the question.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Poor Answer Extraction/Synthesis:** The system frequently fails to extract the specific piece of information (e.g., a year, a numerical value) that directly answers the question, instead often returning the name of the source itself or a more general description.\n2. **Lack of Granularity in Information Retrieval:** The system retrieves information but struggles to pinpoint the *precise* answer within that information. It accepts the \"retrieved info\" field as the final answer, even when it's not the most specific response.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Answer Extraction Logic:** The primary bottleneck is the logic responsible for extracting the final answer from the retrieved information. The current system appears to accept the *source of information* as the *information itself*, leading to incorrect answers.\n2. **Lack of Answer Type Awareness:** The system does not seem to be considering the expected answer type (e.g., year, number) when extracting the final answer from the retrieved information. This lack of \"awareness\" allows it to return source names instead of the required data types.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Source as Answer:** The most prevalent error is providing the *source* of information (e.g., \"Billboard Magazine archives\", \"Who's Who in Italy\") as the answer, rather than the actual data the user is requesting (e.g., \"1991\", \"2006\").\n2. **Numerical Value Mismatch:** When a numerical answer is expected, the system sometimes provides a *related* numerical value but not the *correct* one (e.g., \"840 nits\" instead of \"1200 nits\").\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **failure to accurately extract the specific, desired information from the retrieved text**, particularly when the answer should be a specific data type such as a year or a numerical value. The system stops at finding a relevant passage, but it doesn't have the necessary logic to pinpoint and return the *exact* answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Answer Extraction:** Improve the answer extraction logic to specifically identify and isolate the exact piece of information that directly answers the question, rather than simply providing the source or related text.\n2. **Answer Type Validation:** Implement answer type validation to ensure the extracted answer matches the expected data type (e.g., year, number, string). The system needs to *know* that if the question asks for a year, it must return a year and not a source name.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Introduce Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Implement NER to identify specific entities in the retrieved information (dates, numbers, organizations, etc.). This can help the system identify potential answers and prioritize them.\n2. **Implement Question-Specific Answer Parsing:** Tailor the answer parsing logic to the specific question type. For example, if the question contains \"in what year,\" the system should focus on extracting a year from the retrieved information.\n3. **Develop a Post-Processing Step:** Implement a post-processing step that checks the extracted answer against the question and the retrieved information to ensure it is both relevant and accurate. This step could also include a \"data type validation\" check.\n4. **Fine-tune the Verification Step:** Make the verification step more robust. The current \"VALID\" label might be too lenient. Verification should not only check if the retrieved information is *related* but also if it contains the *exact answer*.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed - Did not extract the specific year.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Generated an incorrect answer (source name).\n    *   solution_verification: Partially Failed - Verified that the source was relevant, but didn't check for the correctness of the extracted answer.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed - Extracted the wrong numerical value.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Generated an incorrect answer (numerical value).\n    *   solution_verification: Partially Failed - Verified that the source was relevant, but didn't check for the correctness of the extracted numerical value.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed - Did not extract the specific year.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Generated an incorrect answer (source name).\n    *   solution_verification: Partially Failed - Verified that the source was relevant, but didn't check for the correctness of the extracted answer.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the Error Analysis Report's findings. The system consistently demonstrates the following:\n\n*   **Correct Source Selection:** The sources chosen are appropriate for the questions asked. Trusted Reviews for phone specs, Billboard for music history, and Who's Who for biographical information are all valid choices.\n*   **Superficial Verification:** The \"Verification\" step correctly identifies the *relevance* of the retrieved information to the question, labeling it as \"VALID.\" However, it fails to check if the extracted answer is the *precise* and *correct* answer. The verification step seems focused solely on source relevance and a broad connection between the source and question.\n*   **Failed Answer Extraction:** The most glaring issue is the poor answer extraction. In two instances, the system returns the *source* as the answer (e.g., \"Billboard Magazine archives\" instead of \"1973\"). In the numerical value question, it returns a related but incorrect number (840 nits instead of 1200 nits, although the target value isn't explicitly present in the snippets, the system's answer still should have been \"unknown\", not a related value). The system demonstrates a clear inability to pinpoint the specific piece of information required to answer the question.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system exhibits a fundamental flaw in its ability to extract the *precise* answer from relevant information. While it can identify appropriate sources and retrieve related text, it fails to isolate the specific data point required to answer the question. The accuracy score of 0.00 (0/3) reflects this core deficiency. The system demonstrates strength in source retrieval and relevance but falls drastically short in information extraction and validation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Reliable Source Selection:** The system's ability to identify and select credible sources for different types of questions is a significant strength. This foundation is crucial for building a reliable AI system.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Precise Answer Extraction:** The inability to extract the *precise* answer from retrieved information is the most critical weakness. This flaw undermines the entire system's utility, as it consistently provides incorrect or incomplete answers.\n*   **Lack of Data Type Awareness:** The system's failure to consider the expected data type (year, number, string) when extracting the answer contributes significantly to the poor accuracy. It treats all retrieved information equally, regardless of whether it matches the question's required data type.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Precise Answer Extraction**. Without this, the system's other strengths are rendered largely irrelevant. The system needs to identify and isolate the exact piece of information that answers the question and validate that it matches the expected data type.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Targeted Information Extraction Module:** Replace the current answer extraction logic with a module that uses more sophisticated techniques, such as:\n    *   **Keyword-Based Extraction:** Focus on extracting text surrounding keywords from the question.

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM with a \"Visual Attention and Transformation Synthesis\" strategy. The problem is decomposed into key element identification, transformation rule synthesis, and grid reconstruction. The agent acts as an expert in visual pattern recognition and transformation.\n\nThe functions used are `main`, `solve_grid_transformation`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function initiates the process by calling `solve_grid_transformation`. The `solve_grid_transformation` decomposes the problem into the three steps, calls the LLM via the function `call_llm` with prompts for each step, attempts to refine and apply the rule and validates the transformation.\n\nThe overall workflow involves first identifying key elements, then synthesizing a transformation rule based on those elements, and finally reconstructing the grid based on the identified rule, iterating with refinement and validation until a valid transformation is found.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:**\n\n*As provided in the initial prompt.*\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal several critical issues.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system correctly extracts the key elements and identifies the transformation rule (changing 0s adjacent to 4s to 7s). However, the generated code, although syntactically correct, produces an output that deviates from the intended logic. Despite identifying the correct rule, the transformation performed by the code is invalid. The retrying mechanism proves ineffective, as it simply repeats the same flawed logic. The system defaults to a matrix of zeros after multiple failed attempts, further highlighting the lack of error handling.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system appears to correctly identify the rotation transformation. However, the 'Transformed Grid Text' shows an incorrect rotation result. Again, the system retries with the same code, resulting in the same failure. The system eventually defaults to a zero matrix.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system times out. This indicates the generated code likely contains an infinite loop or is computationally inefficient, making it unable to complete within the allocated time. This suggests a potential problem with algorithm complexity or ineffective optimization.\n\nA pattern emerges where the system:\n\n1.  Correctly identifies the key information and at least parts of the rule.\n2.  Generates syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code.\n3.  Fails to perform the correct transformation, despite \"understanding\" the rule.\n4.  Retries with the same flawed logic multiple times.\n5.  Defaults to a zero matrix on failure.\n6.  Fails to learn from past errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capability in solving grid transformation problems. While it can extract key information and generate syntactically correct code, it consistently fails to translate complex transformation rules into functional algorithms. The lack of error handling, debugging mechanisms, and adaptive retry strategies renders the system ineffective.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system demonstrates the ability to identify the key elements of the problem, such as relevant numbers or spatial relationships within the grid.\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can generate syntactically correct Python code, indicating a basic understanding of programming language constructs.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Transformation Rule Inference:** The system struggles with accurately and completely identifying complex transformation rules.\n*   **Code Generation for Complex Spatial Logic:** The system struggles to translate identified transformation rules into correct and efficient code, especially when spatial relationships are involved.\n*   **Debugging and Error Recovery:** The system lacks the ability to debug its own code and learn from errors, resulting in repeated failures.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Code Generation for Complex Spatial Logic**. The system can extract information and identify rules, but the critical bottleneck is its inability to translate these rules into functioning code that accurately transforms the grid. Addressing this weakness will have the most significant impact on overall system performance.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Code Templates with Spatial Awareness:** Instead of generating code from scratch, utilize code templates tailored to common grid transformation types (rotations, reflections, translations, neighborhood-based modifications). These templates should include placeholders for specific parameters and logic based on the identified transformation rule.  For example, a template for a rotation transformation could handle the index manipulations required for different rotation angles. These templates should *include* spatial awareness from the start.\n2.  **Integrate Debugging Print Statements into Code Generation:** Automatically insert print statements at key points within the generated code to track the state of the grid during transformation. This will allow for easier diagnosis of errors. Specifically, print statements showing grid modifications step-by-step, or at the very least before and after rule-specific steps.\n3.  **Develop a Unit Testing Module for Code Verification:** Create a module to run unit tests on the generated code before execution. These tests should check for common errors, such as out-of-bounds access, incorrect index calculations, and unexpected side effects. The unit tests should cover edge cases and boundary conditions.\n4.  **Introduce Adaptive Retry Logic:** Instead of simply retrying the same code, implement a mechanism to modify the code or inferred rules based on the errors encountered during previous attempts. For instance, if a timeout occurs, the system could try simplifying the transformation rule or optimizing the code for efficiency.\n5.  **Implement Output Sanity Checks:** Before declaring success, implement sanity checks on the generated output. This could include checking if the output grid contains only valid values, if the overall structure of the grid has been preserved, and if the transformation is \"reasonable\" given the input. As mentioned previously, check smoothness and statistical properties.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the system's capabilities are currently **stable** at a very low level of performance. The repeated failures and lack of learning suggest that the current architecture and algorithms are insufficient for solving complex grid transformation problems. The proposed improvements are designed to break this stagnation and drive the system towards improved performance.\n",

    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:**\n\n*As provided in the initial prompt.*\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal several critical issues.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system correctly extracts the key elements and identifies the transformation rule (changing 0s adjacent to 4s to 7s). However, the generated code, although syntactically correct, produces an output that deviates from the intended logic. Despite identifying the correct rule, the transformation performed by the code is invalid. The retrying mechanism proves ineffective, as it simply repeats the same flawed logic. The system defaults to a matrix of zeros after multiple failed attempts, further highlighting the lack of error handling.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system appears to correctly identify the rotation transformation. However, the 'Transformed Grid Text' shows an incorrect rotation result. Again, the system retries with the same code, resulting in the same failure. The system eventually defaults to a zero matrix.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system times out. This indicates the generated code likely contains an infinite loop or is computationally inefficient, making it unable to complete within the allocated time. This suggests a potential problem with algorithm complexity or ineffective optimization.\n\nA pattern emerges where the system:\n\n1.  Correctly identifies the key information and at least parts of the rule.\n2.  Generates syntactically valid but semantically incorrect code.\n3.  Fails to perform the correct transformation, despite \"understanding\" the rule.\n4.  Retries with the same flawed logic multiple times.\n5.  Defaults to a zero matrix on failure.\n6.  Fails to learn from past errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capability in solving grid transformation problems. While it can extract key information and generate syntactically correct code, it consistently fails to translate complex transformation rules into functional algorithms. The lack of error handling, debugging mechanisms, and adaptive retry strategies renders the system ineffective.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system demonstrates the ability to identify the key elements of the problem, such as relevant numbers or spatial relationships within the grid.\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can generate syntactically correct Python code, indicating a basic understanding of programming language constructs.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Transformation Rule Inference:** The system struggles with accurately and completely identifying complex transformation rules.\n*   **Code Generation for Complex Spatial Logic:** The system struggles to translate identified transformation rules into correct and efficient code, especially when spatial relationships are involved.\n*   **Debugging and Error Recovery:** The system lacks the ability to debug its own code and learn from errors, resulting in repeated failures.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Code Generation for Complex Spatial Logic**. The system can extract information and identify rules, but the critical bottleneck is its inability to translate these rules into functioning code that accurately transforms the grid. Addressing this weakness will have the most significant impact on overall system performance.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Code Templates with Spatial Awareness:** Instead of generating code from scratch, utilize code templates tailored to common grid transformation types (rotations, reflections, translations, neighborhood-based modifications). These templates should include placeholders for specific parameters and logic based on the identified transformation rule.  For example, a template for a rotation transformation could handle the index manipulations required for different rotation angles. These templates should *include* spatial awareness from the start.\n2.  **Integrate Debugging Print Statements into Code Generation:** Automatically insert print statements at key points within the generated code to track the state of the grid during transformation. This will allow for easier diagnosis of errors. Specifically, print statements showing grid modifications step-by-step, or at the very least before and after rule-specific steps.\n3.  **Develop a Unit Testing Module for Code Verification:** Create a module to run unit tests on the generated code before execution. These tests should check for common errors, such as out-of-bounds access, incorrect index calculations, and unexpected side effects. The unit tests should cover edge cases and boundary conditions.\n4.  **Introduce Adaptive Retry Logic:** Instead of simply retrying the same code, implement a mechanism to modify the code or inferred rules based on the errors encountered during previous attempts. For instance, if a timeout occurs, the system could try simplifying the transformation rule or optimizing the code for efficiency.\n5.  **Implement Output Sanity Checks:** Before declaring success, implement sanity checks on the generated output. This could include checking if the output grid contains only valid values, if the overall structure of the grid has been preserved, and if the transformation is \"reasonable\" given the input. As mentioned previously, check smoothness and statistical properties.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the system's capabilities are currently **stable** at a very low level of performance. The repeated failures and lack of learning suggest that the current architecture and algorithms are insufficient for solving complex grid transformation problems. The proposed improvements are designed to break this stagnation and drive the system towards improved performance.\n"

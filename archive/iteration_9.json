  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by extracting key information (participants, duration, time constraints) using the `extract_key_info` function. It then extracts schedules for each participant using `extract_schedule`, and finally, `find_available_time_slot` determines an available time slot based on the extracted information and schedules, all using LLM reasoning. The functions work together in a sequence; `main` calls `extract_key_info` and then calls `extract_and_validate_schedules` which calls `extract_schedule` for each participant to get each of their individual schedules and lastly it calls `find_available_time_slot` using the extracted information and schedules. The workflow involves information extraction, schedule validation, and time slot optimization, each relying on LLM to parse natural language and identify valid times.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error across all provided samples is: \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This error indicates a `JSONDecodeError`. It suggests that the system is attempting to parse an empty string or invalid JSON format as a JSON object. This typically happens when the LLM fails to produce a valid JSON response, resulting in an empty or non-JSON string being passed to `json.loads()`.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system attempts to use a structured format (JSON) for information exchange, which can facilitate programmatic processing of LLM outputs.\n2.  The problem descriptions acknowledge the need for constraint handling and highlight the importance of identifying valid solutions.\n3.  The system is designed for scheduling meetings, a practical and common task.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system is highly prone to runtime errors, specifically `JSONDecodeError`, indicating a lack of robustness in handling unexpected LLM outputs. The system appears to be brittle, unable to gracefully handle situations where the LLM doesn't conform to expected JSON output.\n2.  The system consistently fails to produce a valid answer, even when a solution exists. This suggests fundamental issues in information extraction, constraint handling, and/or solution generation.\n3.  There's likely a lack of error handling and validation of LLM outputs before attempting to parse them as JSON.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Validation:** The system lacks robust validation of the LLM's output. It blindly attempts to parse the LLM's response as JSON without checking if it's a valid JSON string.\n2.  **LLM Response Reliability:** The LLM is frequently failing to generate valid JSON, indicating potential issues with the prompt design or the LLM's ability to consistently follow instructions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent `JSONDecodeError`:** The same error occurs across all samples, indicating a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents.\n2.  **No Solution Generated:** The system consistently fails to generate any proposed meeting time, even when the problem description states that a solution exists. This suggests failures in the core logic for identifying available time slots and satisfying constraints.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **lack of robust error handling and LLM output validation**. The system's reliance on the LLM to produce perfect JSON output without any validation results in frequent `JSONDecodeError` exceptions, causing the entire process to fail.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Validation:** Implement rigorous checks to validate LLM outputs before attempting to parse them. Specifically, verify that the output is a non-empty string and appears to be valid JSON before passing it to `json.loads()`.\n2.  **Prompt Engineering:** Revise the prompt to the LLM to encourage more reliable JSON output. This could include providing clearer examples of the desired JSON format, explicitly stating the need to respond in valid JSON, and potentially simplifying the structure of the expected JSON output. Consider few-shot learning with multiple examples.\n3.  **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling to gracefully catch `JSONDecodeError` exceptions. When an error occurs, log the error message and LLM output for debugging purposes. Then, consider a fallback strategy, such as retrying the LLM call with a slightly modified prompt or returning a default \"no solution found\" message.\n4.  **Information Extraction & Constraint Handling:** Improve the information extraction logic to reliably identify participants, schedules, constraints, and preferences. Implement stricter validation to ensure all necessary information is extracted correctly. Enhance constraint handling logic to accurately identify available time slots based on the extracted schedules and constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a `validate_json_output` function:** This function should take the LLM output as input and return `True` if it's valid JSON, and `False` otherwise. Use this function before calling `json.loads()`.\n2.  **Modify the LLM prompt to include specific output format instructions:** For example, add \"Respond ONLY with valid JSON\" and provide multiple examples of the desired output format.\n3.  **Implement a retry mechanism with a modified prompt on `JSONDecodeError`:** If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, catch the exception, modify the prompt (e.g., simplify the requested JSON structure, ask the LLM to double-check its response), and retry the LLM call.\n4.  **Implement a fallback mechanism:** If the LLM call fails after multiple retries, return a structured \"no solution found\" message instead of crashing with an exception.\n5.  **Implement a more deterministic function to parse information from the question**: Instead of relying solely on the LLM, use the LLM to extract data, then use a deterministic parser to process it.\n6.  **Implement a multi-agent approach**: Dedicate one agent to parsing, one to finding the solution, and one to verifying.\n7.  **Use a ReAct pattern**: Allow the agent to reason, extract information, and then generate the response.\n8.  **Improve information extraction using few-shot examples**: Provide more examples in the prompt.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, I will generate a thorough capability assessment for the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and the guidelines for excellence.\n\n```text\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs confirm the `JSONDecodeError` as the dominant, and in fact only, error. The output \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" is repeated across all three provided samples, definitively showing that the system fails to parse the LLM's output as JSON. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest a wrapper around the LLM output, but this wrapper does not prevent the underlying error.  The consistency of this error strongly suggests the LLM is consistently failing to return a valid JSON object, or is returning an empty string.  No proposed solutions or meeting times are ever successfully returned.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently exhibits extremely limited capabilities. While the design aims for a practical task (scheduling meetings), the current implementation is entirely non-functional due to its inability to handle LLM outputs. The system is effectively unable to perform any of the intended tasks of information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, or solution verification, as evidenced by the 0% accuracy.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\nThe key strengths, in this early stage, are primarily design-oriented:\n\n*   **Structured Output Format (JSON):** The intent to use JSON for structured data exchange is a good foundation, if it can be made to work reliably.\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** The system attempts to decompose the scheduling problem into steps like information extraction, constraint handling, and solution generation.\n\nThese strengths are currently unrealized due to the critical errors present.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Brittle LLM Output Handling:** The system's complete dependence on the LLM producing perfect JSON, without any error checking or fallback mechanisms, is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Solution Generation:** The inability to generate any meeting time proposals indicates a fundamental flaw in the core logic.\n*   **Zero Accuracy:** The 0% accuracy score underscores the complete failure of the system in its current state.\n*   **Ineffective Error Handling:**  The system reports \"an unexpected error,\" but doesn't attempt to handle the error and retry or produce a different result.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **LLM Output Handling and Validation**. The system cannot function until it can reliably process the output of the LLM, even if the LLM's response is imperfect. This includes validating the output as valid JSON and handling cases where the LLM does not provide a valid response.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM Output Validation (Critical):**\n    *   Before calling `json.loads()`, use a function like `is_json_string(llm_output)` to verify if the LLM output is a valid JSON string.  This function can use a `try-except` block with `json.loads()` to check for validity without raising an unhandled exception.\n    *   If `is_json_string()` returns `False`, do *not* call `json.loads()`. Instead, trigger a fallback mechanism (see below).\n2.  **Implement a Fallback Mechanism (Critical):**\n    *   If the LLM output is invalid JSON, retry the LLM call with a modified prompt that simplifies the requested JSON structure and explicitly asks for valid JSON. For example:  \"Respond with ONLY a JSON object containing the available meeting times.  Ensure the JSON is valid.\"\n    *   If the LLM call fails again (after a reasonable number of retries, e.g., 3), return a structured \"no solution found\" message that is itself a valid JSON object.  This prevents the system from crashing and provides a consistent output format.  Example: `{\"available_meeting_times\": []}`\n3.  **Prompt Engineering with Few-Shot Examples (High Priority):**\n    *   Revise the LLM prompt to include multiple, diverse examples of the desired JSON output format. These examples should cover different scenarios and potential variations in the input data.\n    *   Include clear instructions in the prompt that explicitly state the need to respond in valid JSON.  For example, \"You MUST respond with a valid JSON object that conforms to the following format...\"\n4.  **Improve Information Extraction Logic (Medium Priority):**\n    *   After implementing the above error handling, analyze the cases where the LLM *does* return valid JSON, but the solution is still incorrect.\n    *   Focus on improving the prompt to extract the relevant information accurately.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **Declining sharply**. The system is non-functional and consistently fails due to the lack of basic error handling. Addressing the LLM output handling issue is crucial for any progress.\n```",

The system consistently fails to produce a valid answer, even when a solution exists. This suggests fundamental issues in information extraction, constraint handling, and/or solution generation.\n3.  There's likely a lack of error handling and validation of LLM outputs before attempting to parse them as JSON.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Validation:** The system lacks robust validation of the LLM's output. It blindly attempts to parse the LLM's response as JSON without checking if it's a valid JSON string.\n2.  **LLM Response Reliability:** The LLM is frequently failing to generate valid JSON, indicating potential issues with the prompt design or the LLM's ability to consistently follow instructions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent `JSONDecodeError`:** The same error occurs across all samples, indicating a systemic issue rather than isolated incidents.\n2.  **No Solution Generated:** The system consistently fails to generate any proposed meeting time, even when the problem description states that a solution exists. This suggests failures in the core logic for identifying available time slots and satisfying constraints.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **lack of robust error handling and LLM output validation**. The system's reliance on the LLM to produce perfect JSON output without any validation results in frequent `JSONDecodeError` exceptions, causing the entire process to fail.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Validation:** Implement rigorous checks to validate LLM outputs before attempting to parse them. Specifically, verify that the output is a non-empty string and appears to be valid JSON before passing it to `json.loads()`.\n2.  **Prompt Engineering:** Revise the prompt to the LLM to encourage more reliable JSON output. This could include providing clearer examples of the desired JSON format, explicitly stating the need to respond in valid JSON, and potentially simplifying the structure of the expected JSON output. Consider few-shot learning with multiple examples.\n3.  **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling to gracefully catch `JSONDecodeError` exceptions. When an error occurs, log the error message and LLM output for debugging purposes. Then, consider a fallback strategy, such as retrying the LLM call with a slightly modified prompt or returning a default \"no solution found\" message.\n4.  **Information Extraction & Constraint Handling:** Improve the information extraction logic to reliably identify participants, schedules, constraints, and preferences. Implement stricter validation to ensure all necessary information is extracted correctly. Enhance constraint handling logic to accurately identify available time slots based on the extracted schedules and constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a `validate_json_output` function:** This function should take the LLM output as input and return `True` if it's valid JSON, and `False` otherwise. Use this function before calling `json.loads()`.\n2.  **Modify the LLM prompt to include specific output format instructions:** For example, add \"Respond ONLY with valid JSON\" and provide multiple examples of the desired output format.\n3.  **Implement a retry mechanism with a modified prompt on `JSONDecodeError`:** If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, catch the exception, modify the prompt (e.g., simplify the requested JSON structure, ask the LLM to double-check its response), and retry the LLM call.\n4.  **Implement a fallback mechanism:** If the LLM call fails after multiple retries, return a structured \"no solution found\" message instead of crashing with an exception.\n5.  **Implement a more deterministic function to parse information from the question**: Instead of relying solely on the LLM, use the LLM to extract data, then use a deterministic parser to process it.\n6.  **Implement a multi-agent approach**: Dedicate one agent to parsing, one to finding the solution, and one to verifying.\n7.  **Use a ReAct pattern**: Allow the agent to reason, extract information, and then generate the response.\n8.  **Improve information extraction using few-shot examples**: Provide more examples in the prompt.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, I will generate a thorough capability assessment for the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and the guidelines for excellence.\n\n```text\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs confirm the `JSONDecodeError` as the dominant, and in fact only, error. The output \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" is repeated across all three provided samples, definitively showing that the system fails to parse the LLM's output as JSON. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest a wrapper around the LLM output, but this wrapper does not prevent the underlying error.  The consistency of this error strongly suggests the LLM is consistently failing to return a valid JSON object, or is returning an empty string.  No proposed solutions or meeting times are ever successfully returned.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently exhibits extremely limited capabilities. While the design aims for a practical task (scheduling meetings), the current implementation is entirely non-functional due to its inability to handle LLM outputs. The system is effectively unable to perform any of the intended tasks of information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, or solution verification, as evidenced by the 0% accuracy.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\nThe key strengths, in this early stage, are primarily design-oriented:\n\n*   **Structured Output Format (JSON):** The intent to use JSON for structured data exchange is a good foundation, if it can be made to work reliably.\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** The system attempts to decompose the scheduling problem into steps like information extraction, constraint handling, and solution generation.\n\nThese strengths are currently unrealized due to the critical errors present.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Brittle LLM Output Handling:** The system's complete dependence on the LLM producing perfect JSON, without any error checking or fallback mechanisms, is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Solution Generation:** The inability to generate any meeting time proposals indicates a fundamental flaw in the core logic.\n*   **Zero Accuracy:** The 0% accuracy score underscores the complete failure of the system in its current state.\n*   **Ineffective Error Handling:**  The system reports \"an unexpected error,\" but doesn't attempt to handle the error and retry or produce a different result.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **LLM Output Handling and Validation**. The system cannot function until it can reliably process the output of the LLM, even if the LLM's response is imperfect. This includes validating the output as valid JSON and handling cases where the LLM does not provide a valid response.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM Output Validation (Critical):**\n    *   Before calling `json.loads()`, use a function like `is_json_string(llm_output)` to verify if the LLM output is a valid JSON string.  This function can use a `try-except` block with `json.loads()` to check for validity without raising an unhandled exception.\n    *   If `is_json_string()` returns `False`, do *not* call `json.loads()`. Instead, trigger a fallback mechanism (see below).\n2.  **Implement a Fallback Mechanism (Critical):**\n    *   If the LLM output is invalid JSON, retry the LLM call with a modified prompt that simplifies the requested JSON structure and explicitly asks for valid JSON. For example:  \"Respond with ONLY a JSON object containing the available meeting times.  Ensure the JSON is valid.\"\n    *   If the LLM call fails again (after a reasonable number of retries, e.g., 3), return a structured \"no solution found\" message that is itself a valid JSON object.  This prevents the system from crashing and provides a consistent output format.  Example: `{\"available_meeting_times\": []}`\n3.  **Prompt Engineering with Few-Shot Examples (High Priority):**\n    *   Revise the LLM prompt to include multiple, diverse examples of the desired JSON output format. These examples should cover different scenarios and potential variations in the input data.\n    *   Include clear instructions in the prompt that explicitly state the need to respond in valid JSON.  For example, \"You MUST respond with a valid JSON object that conforms to the following format...\"\n4.  **Improve Information Extraction Logic (Medium Priority):**\n    *   After implementing the above error handling, analyze the cases where the LLM *does* return valid JSON, but the solution is still incorrect.\n    *   Focus on improving the prompt to extract the relevant information accurately.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **Declining sharply**. The system is non-functional and consistently fails due to the lack of basic error handling. Addressing the LLM output handling issue is crucial for any progress.\n```"

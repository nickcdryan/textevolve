Study the examples carefully and explain the transformation logic in plain English.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n    Output Grid:\n    [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]\n    Explanation: Each element in the input grid becomes a diagonal in a larger grid. The original value becomes the element, the rest are zeros.\n\n    Example 2:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[2, 8], [8, 2]]\n    Output Grid:\n    [[2, 2, 8, 8], [2, 2, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 2], [8, 8, 2, 2]]\n    Explanation: Each element is expanded to a 2x2 block with the element's value. The value is simply repeated throughout the 2x2 block derived from the original value.\n\n    Example 3:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]\n    Output Grid:\n    [[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]\n    Explanation: The input grid is overlaid onto a grid of zeros; the value of 1 replaces 0; the values of 0 remain as 0. The input grid is essentially copied, and then the 0's from the original grid replace 1's in the final grid, or the 1's from the original grid replace 0's in the final grid.\n\n    Now, explain the transformation rule applied to this example.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a two-step LLM-driven approach to solve grid transformation problems: first, it extracts the transformation rule from example grids, then it applies this rule to a new grid. The problem is decomposed into rule extraction and rule application. The LLM acts as a pattern identifier and rule applier. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates the process by generating prompts for rule extraction and application, calling the `call_llm` function, and validating the output. The `call_llm` function sends prompts to the Gemini model and returns the response. The overall workflow involves prompting the LLM to extract a transformation rule, then prompting it again to apply the extracted rule to generate the transformed grid.",

The system does not seem to abstract the relationships between the positions of elements in the input grid and their corresponding transformations in the output grid.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system consistently generates syntactically correct Python code. This is a positive sign.\n*   **Grid Structure:** The output grids are of the correct dimensions, indicating that the system understands the required output format.\n*   **Value Retention/Introduction:**  While the system extracts numbers from the input, it fails to transform them correctly. The outputs often contain some of the numbers present in the input grids, suggesting a weak attempt to retain some elements, but the transformation logic is faulty.\n*   **Pattern Misapplication:** The generated grids do not reflect the transformation patterns intended in the tasks. There's little to no correlation between the transformations observed in the training examples and the transformations applied to the test inputs. This suggests the system attempts to mimic, not understand.\n*   **Inconsistent Transformation:** The numbers in the grid are often placed incorrectly relative to the input grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system's performance is poor, with an accuracy of 0.00. While the system demonstrates some basic capabilities like parsing the input, generating valid code, and maintaining the grid structure, it fundamentally fails at the core task of learning and applying transformation rules. The AI system can correctly parse input, but completely misses the end goal, failing to find an accurate transformation.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Syntactically Correct Code Generation:** Consistently producing valid Python code.\n*   **Basic Input Parsing:** Successfully extracts the input grid dimensions and values.\n*   **Structural Understanding:** Generates output grids with the expected dimensions.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** Inability to learn and generalize transformation patterns from training examples. This is the **most critical weakness.**\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Poor understanding of spatial relationships and dependencies within the grid.\n*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Fails to abstract underlying rules driving the transformations.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Poor ability to synthesize information from multiple examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**.  The system *must* be able to identify, abstract, and apply the underlying transformation patterns present in the training data.  Without this, all other improvements are marginal.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis, here are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, prioritizing pattern recognition:\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Treat the grids as images and use CNNs to learn spatial features and patterns.  Start with simple CNN architectures and gradually increase complexity as needed. Consider adding multiple convolutional layers with different filter sizes to capture patterns at various scales.\n2.  **Attention Mechanisms with CNNs:** Integrate attention mechanisms within the CNN architecture. This will enable the system to focus on the most relevant parts of the input grid when learning the transformations. The attention mechanism should highlight the specific locations where transformations are most likely to occur.\n3.  **Rule Induction with Spatial Encoding:** After the CNN, use a rule induction layer that explicitly formulates rules based on the CNN\u2019s output. Encode spatial relationships into the rule induction process. For example, rules could be based on the relative positions of numbers in the input grid. Rules must be based on spatial patterns.\n4.  **Data Augmentation with Spatial Transformations:**  Augment the training data aggressively with rotations, reflections, translations, and scaling of the input grids. Ensure that the corresponding output grids are transformed accordingly. Focus on spatial and numerical transformations.\n5.  **Debugging and Visualization Tools:** Create visualizations of the feature maps learned by the CNNs. Implement logging and debugging tools to track the flow of information through the network.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0.00 accuracy), the capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. Without significant changes focused on pattern recognition and generalization, there will be no improvement. The current implementation shows no promise of improvement.\n",

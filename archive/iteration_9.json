Three \"expert\" agent roles are used within the `extract_and_validate_data`, `infer_transformation_rule`, and `apply_rule_with_verification` functions to handle their respective tasks. The `call_llm` function interfaces with the Gemini API. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `extract_and_validate_data` to retrieve data, then `infer_transformation_rule` to deduce the transformation logic, and finally `apply_rule_with_verification` to generate the transformed grid.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system correctly identifies the need for reflection and shifting. However, it incorrectly calculates the shift value (rounding down 17/4 to 4 instead of correctly handling the decimal). More critically, the code implements the reflection *before* the shift, which is the opposite of what's suggested in the refined rule description. The code iterates through each row, reflects it, and then applies a circular shift. The combination of incorrect shift value and order of operations leads to an entirely incorrect output.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system correctly identifies the largest non-zero element. However, the description of the transformation logic is needlessly convoluted, which suggests a difficulty interpreting the rule. The code iterates through each row and column, and when it finds a non-zero element, it sets all elements *from (0,0) to (r+n-1, c+n-1)* to the largest non-zero value. This is a misinterpretation of the rule and results in the entire grid being filled with the largest value.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system correctly interprets the transformation rule: \"copies the element at (i, 3) to (i, 4) if the element at (i, 4) is 0\". The logic is accurately implemented in the code. However, the overall accuracy is still zero because this alone is not sufficient to correctly solve the task. The problem is that the reasoning doesn't recognize this rule is one piece of a larger puzzle.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates a *very* basic capability for rule extraction and code generation, but is severely limited by its inaccurate implementation of the rules. It can generate Python code and perform iterative operations on grids, but it struggles to translate abstract rules into precise code logic. The primary failure point is the consistent misinterpretation and flawed coding of transformation rules.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** The system attempts to break down the problem, which is helpful for understanding its logic and debugging.\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can automatically generate Python code, which saves time and effort.\n*   **Rule Extraction (Partial):** The system can extract *some* of the transformation rules, although not always accurately or completely.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Rule Implementation:** The generated code rarely accurately reflects the extracted transformation rules. This is the *most* critical weakness.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Refined Rules:** Even after refining rules, the system often misunderstands their meaning or the order of operations needed to implement them.\n*   **Lack of Robust Pattern Recognition:** The system fails to generalize rules to slightly different input patterns, which suggests overfitting to the training data.\n*   **No Holistic Understanding:** Even when one rule is correctly understood and implemented, the system fails to recognize that it's likely a sub-component of a more complex transformation.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Rule Implementation**. The system *must* be able to translate abstract transformation rules into precise and executable code.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Strengthen Rule Extraction with Subtasks:** Break down the rule extraction process into smaller, more manageable subtasks:\n    *   *Identify Transformation Type:* Explicitly identify the *type* of transformation involved (rotation, reflection, translation, etc.).\n    *   *Identify Conditions:* Determine the specific conditions under which each transformation should be applied. What elements are affected and when?\n    *   *Formalize Rules:* Translate the identified transformation type and conditions into a precise, unambiguous, formal statement of the rule.\n2.  **Implement Unit Tests for Code Generation:** After the code is generated, run it against the training examples and check its output to ensure it accurately reflects the *intended* transformation.  This will provide immediate feedback on the accuracy of the code generation module. Focus the unit tests on verifying the *correctness* of the code with respect to the extracted rules. Specifically, the unit tests should cover:\n    *   Correct application of individual transformations.\n    *   Correct handling of boundary conditions.\n    *   Correct application of combined transformations.\n3.  **Enhance Code Generation with Verification:** Develop a rule verification mechanism that checks the generated code against the extracted rules to identify potential discrepancies *before* execution. This mechanism should:\n    *   Parse the extracted rule into a formal representation.\n    *   Parse the generated code to identify the corresponding operations.\n    *   Compare the operations to ensure they match the rule's logic.\n    *   Report any discrepancies or inconsistencies.\n4.  **Implement Intermediate Print Statements for Debugging:** Add extensive intermediate print statements within the generated code to track the state of the grid and the transformations being applied at each step. This will help to pinpoint the *exact* failure points and understand why things are going wrong. Capture each step of the code and print outputs for debugging purposes.\n5.  **Implement Tests for Intermediate Steps** Add testing to the intermediate steps of the solution, especially when using the test code and generating intermediate print statements, add assertions that will trigger if intermediate values are wrong.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nThe current capability trend is **stable at a very low level.** While the system exhibits some potential, the fundamental inability to accurately implement extracted rules prevents any meaningful progress. The proposed changes are targeted at addressing this core issue.\n",

This is a misinterpretation of the rule and results in the entire grid being filled with the largest value.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system correctly interprets the transformation rule: \"copies the element at (i, 3) to (i, 4) if the element at (i, 4) is 0\". The logic is accurately implemented in the code. However, the overall accuracy is still zero because this alone is not sufficient to correctly solve the task. The problem is that the reasoning doesn't recognize this rule is one piece of a larger puzzle.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates a *very* basic capability for rule extraction and code generation, but is severely limited by its inaccurate implementation of the rules. It can generate Python code and perform iterative operations on grids, but it struggles to translate abstract rules into precise code logic. The primary failure point is the consistent misinterpretation and flawed coding of transformation rules.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** The system attempts to break down the problem, which is helpful for understanding its logic and debugging.\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can automatically generate Python code, which saves time and effort.\n*   **Rule Extraction (Partial):** The system can extract *some* of the transformation rules, although not always accurately or completely.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Rule Implementation:** The generated code rarely accurately reflects the extracted transformation rules. This is the *most* critical weakness.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Refined Rules:** Even after refining rules, the system often misunderstands their meaning or the order of operations needed to implement them.\n*   **Lack of Robust Pattern Recognition:** The system fails to generalize rules to slightly different input patterns, which suggests overfitting to the training data.\n*   **No Holistic Understanding:** Even when one rule is correctly understood and implemented, the system fails to recognize that it's likely a sub-component of a more complex transformation.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Rule Implementation**. The system *must* be able to translate abstract transformation rules into precise and executable code.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Strengthen Rule Extraction with Subtasks:** Break down the rule extraction process into smaller, more manageable subtasks:\n    *   *Identify Transformation Type:* Explicitly identify the *type* of transformation involved (rotation, reflection, translation, etc.).\n    *   *Identify Conditions:* Determine the specific conditions under which each transformation should be applied. What elements are affected and when?\n    *   *Formalize Rules:* Translate the identified transformation type and conditions into a precise, unambiguous, formal statement of the rule.\n2.  **Implement Unit Tests for Code Generation:** After the code is generated, run it against the training examples and check its output to ensure it accurately reflects the *intended* transformation.  This will provide immediate feedback on the accuracy of the code generation module. Focus the unit tests on verifying the *correctness* of the code with respect to the extracted rules. Specifically, the unit tests should cover:\n    *   Correct application of individual transformations.\n    *   Correct handling of boundary conditions.\n    *   Correct application of combined transformations.\n3.  **Enhance Code Generation with Verification:** Develop a rule verification mechanism that checks the generated code against the extracted rules to identify potential discrepancies *before* execution. This mechanism should:\n    *   Parse the extracted rule into a formal representation.\n    *   Parse the generated code to identify the corresponding operations.\n    *   Compare the operations to ensure they match the rule's logic.\n    *   Report any discrepancies or inconsistencies.\n4.  **Implement Intermediate Print Statements for Debugging:** Add extensive intermediate print statements within the generated code to track the state of the grid and the transformations being applied at each step. This will help to pinpoint the *exact* failure points and understand why things are going wrong. Capture each step of the code and print outputs for debugging purposes.\n5.  **Implement Tests for Intermediate Steps** Add testing to the intermediate steps of the solution, especially when using the test code and generating intermediate print statements, add assertions that will trigger if intermediate values are wrong.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nThe current capability trend is **stable at a very low level.** While the system exhibits some potential, the fundamental inability to accurately implement extracted rules prevents any meaningful progress. The proposed changes are targeted at addressing this core issue.\n"

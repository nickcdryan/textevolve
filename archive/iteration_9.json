  "approach_summary": "The script implements a meeting scheduling system using LLM-driven techniques. The `extract_constraints` function extracts meeting constraints from the input question, and the `schedule_meeting` function proposes a meeting schedule based on these constraints using chain-of-thought reasoning. The `verify_schedule` function validates the proposed schedule against the constraints with step by step reasoning. The overall workflow involves extracting constraints, generating a schedule, and verifying the schedule, with error handling at each step.\n\n        The main function, `main`, orchestrates the scheduling process by calling `extract_constraints`, `schedule_meeting`, and `verify_schedule` in sequence, each leveraging the LLM for reasoning and decision-making. Each function uses the function `call_llm` to access the Gemini API and the helper functions pass the input and output to one another to complete the final answer.",

      "text_report": "Here's a comprehensive capability assessment of your AI system, focusing on actionable improvements:\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe sample execution outputs demonstrate the system's ability to parse participant availability and identify potential meeting slots. However, they also highlight inconsistencies in reasoning and a tendency to prematurely commit to solutions.\n\n*   **Correctness:** All three examples provided an accurate meeting time. However, there is a problem with reasoning and constraint handling.\n*   **Reasoning Errors:** Reasoning, while generally logical, sometimes misses nuances in participant availability, leading to unnecessary constraints or overlooked possibilities. For example, the primary error example shows an incorrect evaluation of available time.\n*   **Decision-Making:** The system seems to proceed linearly through time slots rather than considering all possibilities holistically before proposing a solution. This can lead to suboptimal solutions that might not be the earliest or most convenient option.\n*   **Structure:** There is a rigid structure, but the evaluation does not seem very sophisticated.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** There appears to be no handling of soft constraints, or preferences.\n*   **Scalability:** The structure of the agent would make it difficult to include hundreds of events.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system demonstrates a functional ability to schedule meetings based on provided constraints. However, its reasoning and decision-making processes are prone to errors and inefficiencies, leading to suboptimal solutions. The core capability of parsing and processing availability information is present, but its implementation requires significant improvement.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Basic Scheduling Functionality:** The system can identify potential meeting times based on participant availability, a core requirement.\n*   **Parsing of Time Constraints:** It can successfully interpret and apply time-based constraints.\n*   **Identifies Busy Times:** Successfully uses a list of available and unavailable to identify an open slot.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The system makes errors in applying constraints when evaluating potential meeting times, leading to incorrect solutions. This is the biggest point of failure.\n*   **Suboptimal Solution Selection:** The premature prioritization of earlier options prevents the system from identifying the best overall solution.\n*   **Reasoning Errors:** Inconsistent reasoning quality negatively impacts its reliability.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\n**Constraint Handling:** Focus on improving the system's accuracy and reliability in applying constraints during time slot evaluation. This is the foundation for reliable scheduling.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement Verification Loops for Availability Checks:** Enclose the availability check within a verification loop. For each potential time slot, create a separate LLM call to explicitly confirm each participant's availability. This allows the model to catch constraint handling errors. Use a dedicated verification prompt (see example below).\n\n    ```python\n    def verify_availability(time_slot, participants, schedules):\n        \"\"\"Verifies the availability of participants in a given time slot.\"\"\"\n        system_instruction = \"You are a scheduling assistant. Your job is to verify whether all users are available during the specified time\"\n        verification_prompt = f\"\"\"\n    Time Slot: {time_slot}\n    Participants: {', '.join(participants)}\n    Schedules: {schedules}\n\n    For each participant, determine if they are available during the ENTIRE time slot, based STRICTLY on their schedule.\n\n    Respond with a JSON object:\n    {{\n        \"is_valid\": true/false,\n        \"reason\": \"Explanation if not valid, leave blank if valid\",\n        \"unavailable_participants\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"unavailable\", \"participants\"]\n    }}\n    \"\"\"\n\n        verification_result = call_llm(verification_prompt, system_instruction)\n        return json.loads(verification_result)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Delay Decision-Making Until All Options are Evaluated:** Refactor the system to generate a comprehensive list of all *feasible* meeting times (considering all constraints) *before* making a final decision. Assign scores based on factors like earliness, number of participants with that time marked as \"preferred,\" etc. Then, select the highest-scoring option.\n\n3.  **Few-Shot Learning Improvement:** Enhance the few-shot examples to explicitly demonstrate complex availability and constraint evaluation.

It also missed the fact that the question asks for a one hour meeting and Judith is busy until 11:00 so there is no problem. This reasoning is flawed.\n- Prioritized Monday options *before* fully evaluating Wednesday options, leading to a suboptimal solution.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Incorrect Constraint Handling:** The system misinterprets or misapplies constraints when evaluating potential meeting times, leading to overlooking valid slots.\n- **Suboptimal Decision-Making:** The premature prioritization of Monday options prevents the system from identifying the best overall solution.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- Misinterpretation of availability based on constraints.\n- Early commitment to a solution before exploring all possibilities.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the incorrect application of constraints during the evaluation of potential time slots. Specifically, the system misidentified Pamela's availability on Wednesday, causing it to incorrectly dismiss a valid solution. This flawed reasoning process then resulted in prioritizing a suboptimal solution on Monday.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Constraint Handling:** Improve the accuracy and reliability of constraint application during time slot evaluation.\n- **Solution Generation:** Ensure that all potential solutions are fully evaluated before a final decision is made.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Implement Verification Loops for Availability Checks:** After identifying potential time slots, implement a verification loop using LLM to confirm the availability of each participant during that specific time. This will allow the model to catch its errors.\n- **Delay Decision-Making Until All Options are Evaluated:** Restructure the system to fully evaluate all potential days and time slots before making a final decision. This can be achieved by creating a comprehensive list of all feasible options with associated scores and then selecting the best one based on these scores.\n- **Few Shot Learning Improvement:** Add few shot examples that specifically demonstrate complex availability and constraint evaluation with explicit emphasis on potential pitfalls.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **sample_id: 10**\n    - constraint_handling: Failed\n    - solution_generation: Failed\n    - decision_making: Failed\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Here's a comprehensive capability assessment of your AI system, focusing on actionable improvements:\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe sample execution outputs demonstrate the system's ability to parse participant availability and identify potential meeting slots. However, they also highlight inconsistencies in reasoning and a tendency to prematurely commit to solutions.\n\n*   **Correctness:** All three examples provided an accurate meeting time. However, there is a problem with reasoning and constraint handling.\n*   **Reasoning Errors:** Reasoning, while generally logical, sometimes misses nuances in participant availability, leading to unnecessary constraints or overlooked possibilities. For example, the primary error example shows an incorrect evaluation of available time.\n*   **Decision-Making:** The system seems to proceed linearly through time slots rather than considering all possibilities holistically before proposing a solution. This can lead to suboptimal solutions that might not be the earliest or most convenient option.\n*   **Structure:** There is a rigid structure, but the evaluation does not seem very sophisticated.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** There appears to be no handling of soft constraints, or preferences.\n*   **Scalability:** The structure of the agent would make it difficult to include hundreds of events.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system demonstrates a functional ability to schedule meetings based on provided constraints. However, its reasoning and decision-making processes are prone to errors and inefficiencies, leading to suboptimal solutions. The core capability of parsing and processing availability information is present, but its implementation requires significant improvement.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Basic Scheduling Functionality:** The system can identify potential meeting times based on participant availability, a core requirement.\n*   **Parsing of Time Constraints:** It can successfully interpret and apply time-based constraints.\n*   **Identifies Busy Times:** Successfully uses a list of available and unavailable to identify an open slot.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The system makes errors in applying constraints when evaluating potential meeting times, leading to incorrect solutions. This is the biggest point of failure.\n*   **Suboptimal Solution Selection:** The premature prioritization of earlier options prevents the system from identifying the best overall solution.\n*   **Reasoning Errors:** Inconsistent reasoning quality negatively impacts its reliability.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\n**Constraint Handling:** Focus on improving the system's accuracy and reliability in applying constraints during time slot evaluation. This is the foundation for reliable scheduling.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement Verification Loops for Availability Checks:** Enclose the availability check within a verification loop. For each potential time slot, create a separate LLM call to explicitly confirm each participant's availability. This allows the model to catch constraint handling errors. Use a dedicated verification prompt (see example below).\n\n    ```python\n    def verify_availability(time_slot, participants, schedules):\n        \"\"\"Verifies the availability of participants in a given time slot.\"\"\"\n        system_instruction = \"You are a scheduling assistant. Your job is to verify whether all users are available during the specified time\"\n        verification_prompt = f\"\"\"\n    Time Slot: {time_slot}\n    Participants: {', '.join(participants)}\n    Schedules: {schedules}\n\n    For each participant, determine if they are available during the ENTIRE time slot, based STRICTLY on their schedule.\n\n    Respond with a JSON object:\n    {{\n        \"is_valid\": true/false,\n        \"reason\": \"Explanation if not valid, leave blank if valid\",\n        \"unavailable_participants\": [\"list\", \"of\", \"unavailable\", \"participants\"]\n    }}\n    \"\"\"\n\n        verification_result = call_llm(verification_prompt, system_instruction)\n        return json.loads(verification_result)\n    ```\n\n2.  **Delay Decision-Making Until All Options are Evaluated:** Refactor the system to generate a comprehensive list of all *feasible* meeting times (considering all constraints) *before* making a final decision. Assign scores based on factors like earliness, number of participants with that time marked as \"preferred,\" etc. Then, select the highest-scoring option.\n\n3.  **Few-Shot Learning Improvement:** Enhance the few-shot examples to explicitly demonstrate complex availability and constraint evaluation. Include negative examples where seemingly valid slots are rejected due to subtle constraint violations. Include examples with a mix of hard and soft constraints.\n\n4. **Multi-Agent Approach**: Implement a multi-agent workflow in which one agent is in charge of generating possibilities, another in charge of verifying availabilities, and a final agent to decide.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the limited data, the system's core functionality appears stable, but the highlighted weaknesses suggest a need for significant improvement. Without intervention, the \"stable\" functionality is of limited value due to its unreliability. The trend will likely remain stagnant or potentially decline in perceived capability if these issues are not addressed.\n"

  "approach_summary": "This script uses an iterative question decomposition and contextual fact verification approach, leveraging the Gemini LLM. The problem is decomposed into sub-questions, which are then answered individually, followed by fact verification for each sub-question, and finally, answers are synthesized into a final answer. The agent roles are \"expert question decomposer\", \"expert at answering questions and verifying facts\", and \"expert at synthesizing information\", each used in conjunction with the call_llm function. The functions used are `call_llm` to interact with the LLM and `main` which orchestrates the decomposition, answering, and synthesis steps to answer the question.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Bears entered week six against the undefeated New Orleans Saints, the team Marc Trestman and offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer worked for. The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30-13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3-4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954. Meanwhile, Marshall was targeted only five times during the game (15 percent of targets on the Bears), the lowest since Marshall's arrival in Chicago; the Bears fell to 0-4 in games when Marshall's target percentage is less than 20 percent.\n\nQUESTION: How many points did the Saints win by?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Bengals returned home following their bye week for a week 9 matchup with the Denver Broncos. They entered the game having lost three straight games following their 3-1 start to the season. Entering the game, Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning had never lost to Cincinnati in his career.The two teams traded field goals early, with Broncos kicker Matt Prater connecting on a 43-yard field goal and the Bengals Mike Nugent successfully booting a 28-yard attempt. On the Broncos possession following the Bengals field goal, Peyton Manning masterfully moved the Broncos down the field, dissecting the Cincinnati secondary quickly, leading to an eight play,  eighty yard drive, highlighted by a forty-five yard strike to receiver Demarious Thomas, and culminated with a thirteen-yard pass to Eric Decker for the score. Following the Broncos touchdown, Denver led 10-3.The Broncos would increase their lead to a score of 17-3 on the opening kickoff of the second half, as receiver Trindon Holliday would return the football 105 yards for the score, dealing a sharp blow to a Bengals team that had previously been sticking close to the Broncos.The score however, appeared to motivate the Bengals, as they would go on to count the game's next seventeen points. Second year receiver AJ Green would capture a touchdown reception for the seventh straight game, after quarterback Andy Dalton found him on a 10-yard strike. Each of the next two Denver possessions were ended by Cincinnati cornerback Terrance Newman intercepting Denver quarterback Peyton Manning. A forty-nine yard Mike Nugent field goal, and a two-yard BenJarvus Green-Ellis touchdown run were the result of the two ensuing Bengal possessions; giving them a 20-17 advantage.Unfortunately for Cincinnati, Peyton Manning would then engineer back-to-back touchdown drives, separated by Andy Dalton throwing an interception of his own. Because the drives took place in the fourth quarter, Peyton Manning was officially credited with his forty-eighth career game-winning drive, surpassing Dan Marino for the NFL record in the process.The Bengals would attempt to mount a late comeback, scoring three points on a Mike Nugent field goal in the process, but were unable to recover an onside kick attempt that would have given them a chance to try and tie the game.\n\nQUESTION: Which team won this game?",

        "original_passage": "The Bengals returned home following their bye week for a week 9 matchup with the Denver Broncos. They entered the game having lost three straight games following their 3-1 start to the season. Entering the game, Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning had never lost to Cincinnati in his career.The two teams traded field goals early, with Broncos kicker Matt Prater connecting on a 43-yard field goal and the Bengals Mike Nugent successfully booting a 28-yard attempt. On the Broncos possession following the Bengals field goal, Peyton Manning masterfully moved the Broncos down the field, dissecting the Cincinnati secondary quickly, leading to an eight play,  eighty yard drive, highlighted by a forty-five yard strike to receiver Demarious Thomas, and culminated with a thirteen-yard pass to Eric Decker for the score. Following the Broncos touchdown, Denver led 10-3.The Broncos would increase their lead to a score of 17-3 on the opening kickoff of the second half, as receiver Trindon Holliday would return the football 105 yards for the score, dealing a sharp blow to a Bengals team that had previously been sticking close to the Broncos.The score however, appeared to motivate the Bengals, as they would go on to count the game's next seventeen points. Second year receiver AJ Green would capture a touchdown reception for the seventh straight game, after quarterback Andy Dalton found him on a 10-yard strike. Each of the next two Denver possessions were ended by Cincinnati cornerback Terrance Newman intercepting Denver quarterback Peyton Manning. A forty-nine yard Mike Nugent field goal, and a two-yard BenJarvus Green-Ellis touchdown run were the result of the two ensuing Bengal possessions; giving them a 20-17 advantage.Unfortunately for Cincinnati, Peyton Manning would then engineer back-to-back touchdown drives, separated by Andy Dalton throwing an interception of his own. Because the drives took place in the fourth quarter, Peyton Manning was officially credited with his forty-eighth career game-winning drive, surpassing Dan Marino for the NFL record in the process.The Bengals would attempt to mount a late comeback, scoring three points on a Mike Nugent field goal in the process, but were unable to recover an onside kick attempt that would have given them a chance to try and tie the game.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Dunstable, New Hampshire was a town located in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire. It has been divided into several current cities and towns, including Nashua, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack. The town was originally part of a larger town of Dunstable, Massachusetts, when Massachusetts stretched from Rhode Island up to Maine. The original tract of land was bisected by the Merrimack River, an important route for the lucrative fur and log trade. Dunstable was incorporated as a township in 1673. On July 3, 1706, during Queen Anne's War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing nine while seven of the natives were killed. When the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border was surveyed and adjusted in 1741, the northern part of the town was determined to be in New Hampshire, and was incorporated as a New Hampshire town in 1746. Both the northern New Hampshire half and the southern Massachusetts half prospered, and various villages were formed along the Merrimack, but also along Salmon Brook, the Nashua River, Pennichuck Brook, and the Souhegan River, which also ran through the tract. Over the years, other towns were formed from parts of the original area on both sides of the state line, and in 1836 the remaining part that still bore the name of \"Dunstable, New Hampshire\" was renamed \"Nashua\", after the name of the river that flowed into the Merrimack at the location then referred to as \"Indian Head\". Six years later Nashua split into \"Nashville\" and \"Nashua\", but in 1853 they rejoined and became the \"City of Nashua\". The name Nashville is preserved in the city's Nashville Historic District, and the name Dunstable can still be found in the streets \"New Dunstable Road\", \"Main Dunstable Road\", and \"East Dunstable Road\" .\n\nQUESTION: What year did Nashua split into Nashville and Nashua?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Coming off their comeback win over the Chiefs, the undefeated Broncos traveled to Ford Field to face the winless Detroit Lions on Sunday Night Football. After a scoreless first quarter, the Broncos grabbed the lead late in the second quarter, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. With 1:07 remaining before halftime, the Lions countered, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Joique Bell. It was initially ruled as a fumble, but after review, it was reversed to a touchdown as a result of Bell breaking the plane of the goal line. However, Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib blocked the extra point attempt by former Broncos (now Lions) placekicker Matt Prater, leaving the score at 7-6. In the closing seconds of the first half, the Broncos responded, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 4th-and-1. Following a questionable fumble by Thomas on the Broncos' opening possession of the second half, Lions' quarterback Matthew Stafford threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to running back Ameer Abdullah. However, the Broncos' defense denied a two-point conversion attempt by Bell that would have tied the game.

      "original_passage": "The Bears entered week six against the undefeated New Orleans Saints, the team Marc Trestman and offensive coordinator Aaron Kromer worked for. The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30-13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3-4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954. Meanwhile, Marshall was targeted only five times during the game (15 percent of targets on the Bears), the lowest since Marshall's arrival in Chicago; the Bears fell to 0-4 in games when Marshall's target percentage is less than 20 percent.",

      "original_passage": "The Bengals returned home following their bye week for a week 9 matchup with the Denver Broncos. They entered the game having lost three straight games following their 3-1 start to the season. Entering the game, Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning had never lost to Cincinnati in his career.The two teams traded field goals early, with Broncos kicker Matt Prater connecting on a 43-yard field goal and the Bengals Mike Nugent successfully booting a 28-yard attempt. On the Broncos possession following the Bengals field goal, Peyton Manning masterfully moved the Broncos down the field, dissecting the Cincinnati secondary quickly, leading to an eight play,  eighty yard drive, highlighted by a forty-five yard strike to receiver Demarious Thomas, and culminated with a thirteen-yard pass to Eric Decker for the score. Following the Broncos touchdown, Denver led 10-3.The Broncos would increase their lead to a score of 17-3 on the opening kickoff of the second half, as receiver Trindon Holliday would return the football 105 yards for the score, dealing a sharp blow to a Bengals team that had previously been sticking close to the Broncos.The score however, appeared to motivate the Bengals, as they would go on to count the game's next seventeen points. Second year receiver AJ Green would capture a touchdown reception for the seventh straight game, after quarterback Andy Dalton found him on a 10-yard strike. Each of the next two Denver possessions were ended by Cincinnati cornerback Terrance Newman intercepting Denver quarterback Peyton Manning. A forty-nine yard Mike Nugent field goal, and a two-yard BenJarvus Green-Ellis touchdown run were the result of the two ensuing Bengal possessions; giving them a 20-17 advantage.Unfortunately for Cincinnati, Peyton Manning would then engineer back-to-back touchdown drives, separated by Andy Dalton throwing an interception of his own. Because the drives took place in the fourth quarter, Peyton Manning was officially credited with his forty-eighth career game-winning drive, surpassing Dan Marino for the NFL record in the process.The Bengals would attempt to mount a late comeback, scoring three points on a Mike Nugent field goal in the process, but were unable to recover an onside kick attempt that would have given them a chance to try and tie the game.",

      "original_passage": "Dunstable, New Hampshire was a town located in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire. It has been divided into several current cities and towns, including Nashua, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack. The town was originally part of a larger town of Dunstable, Massachusetts, when Massachusetts stretched from Rhode Island up to Maine. The original tract of land was bisected by the Merrimack River, an important route for the lucrative fur and log trade. Dunstable was incorporated as a township in 1673. On July 3, 1706, during Queen Anne's War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing nine while seven of the natives were killed. When the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border was surveyed and adjusted in 1741, the northern part of the town was determined to be in New Hampshire, and was incorporated as a New Hampshire town in 1746. Both the northern New Hampshire half and the southern Massachusetts half prospered, and various villages were formed along the Merrimack, but also along Salmon Brook, the Nashua River, Pennichuck Brook, and the Souhegan River, which also ran through the tract. Over the years, other towns were formed from parts of the original area on both sides of the state line, and in 1836 the remaining part that still bore the name of \"Dunstable, New Hampshire\" was renamed \"Nashua\", after the name of the river that flowed into the Merrimack at the location then referred to as \"Indian Head\". Six years later Nashua split into \"Nashville\" and \"Nashua\", but in 1853 they rejoined and became the \"City of Nashua\". The name Nashville is preserved in the city's Nashville Historic District, and the name Dunstable can still be found in the streets \"New Dunstable Road\", \"Main Dunstable Road\", and \"East Dunstable Road\" .",

After a scoreless first quarter, the Jets delivered the game's opening strike in the second quarter with a 27-yard field goal from kicker Nick Folk, but the Bengals answered with quarterback Carson Palmer completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jordan Shipley. New York regained the lead with a 53-yard touchdown end-around from wide receiver/quarterback Brad Smith and a 13-yard touchdown pass from Mark Sanchez to Santonio Holmes. Cincinnati responded in the fourth quarter as Aaron Pettrey kicked a 28-yard field goal, but the Jets added Smith's 89-yard kick return for a touchdown, followed by defensive end Trevor Pryce sacking Palmer in the endzone for a safety.

      "original_passage": "Coming off their comeback win over the Chiefs, the undefeated Broncos traveled to Ford Field to face the winless Detroit Lions on Sunday Night Football. After a scoreless first quarter, the Broncos grabbed the lead late in the second quarter, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. With 1:07 remaining before halftime, the Lions countered, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Joique Bell. It was initially ruled as a fumble, but after review, it was reversed to a touchdown as a result of Bell breaking the plane of the goal line. However, Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib blocked the extra point attempt by former Broncos (now Lions) placekicker Matt Prater, leaving the score at 7-6. In the closing seconds of the first half, the Broncos responded, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 4th-and-1. Following a questionable fumble by Thomas on the Broncos' opening possession of the second half, Lions' quarterback Matthew Stafford threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to running back Ameer Abdullah. However, the Broncos' defense denied a two-point conversion attempt by Bell that would have tied the game. Each team alternated punts through the next five possessions, until Broncos' linebacker Shaquil Barrett forced a fumble off Stafford near midfield. However, the Broncos had to settle for a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus at the 7:55 mark of the fourth quarter. The Lions were attempting to grab their first lead of the game, however, on the eighth play of the drive, Stafford was intercepted by Broncos' safety David Bruton. Five plays later, the Broncos expanded their lead, with Manning throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Owen Daniels just before the two-minute warning to put the game out of reach. That was Daniels' first touchdown as a Bronco. Without any timeouts, the Lions advanced to as far as the Broncos' 15-yard line with 34 seconds remaining, but turned the football over on downs.",

However, the system consistently reports inability to answer or incomplete information.

This is a significant logical reasoning error.\n2.  **Inability to synthesize information:** The system fails to combine information in the text. For instance in sample 4, the system needs to determine if there is enough information in the passage to determine the winner by finding the highest team score.\n3.  **Incorrect Subtraction in Some Cases:** The system incorrectly performs subtraction in some cases, indicating issues with basic arithmetic capabilities (sample_id 8).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Arithmetic Reasoning:** The inability to reliably perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) is a critical bottleneck. Even when the correct information is extracted, the system fails at the final calculation step.\n2.  **Information Synthesis and Inference:** The system struggles to combine information from different parts of the passage to answer the question. It frequently claims missing information when the necessary details are present but require inference or synthesis.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **\"Cannot Answer\" Response:** The system frequently defaults to a \"cannot answer\" response, indicating a failure in information extraction or reasoning, even when the required information is present in the passage.\n2.  **Failure to Subtract:** Despite correctly extracting the values needed for subtraction, the system often fails to perform the subtraction, or performs it incorrectly.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **unreliable arithmetic reasoning**, specifically subtraction. This prevents the system from answering questions that require numerical comparisons or differences, even when it successfully extracts the necessary numbers from the passage. The core logic of performing a subtraction operation appears fundamentally flawed or inconsistently implemented.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Arithmetic Reasoning:** Focus on improving the reliability of arithmetic operations, especially subtraction.\n2.  **Information Synthesis:** Enhance the system's ability to synthesize information from different parts of the passage to answer questions that require inference.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement Unit Tests for Arithmetic Operations:** Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests specifically for arithmetic functions, particularly subtraction, to ensure accuracy and identify edge cases.\n2.  **Debug Arithmetic Logic:** Add print statements within the arithmetic functions to trace the values being used and the results produced at each step. This will help pinpoint exactly where the calculation is going wrong.\n3.  **Implement Information Fusion Module:** Develop a dedicated module responsible for identifying and combining relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the passage. This module should use techniques like coreference resolution and relation extraction to link related facts.\n4.  **Prompt Engineering for Intermediate Steps:** If using a large language model, experiment with prompt engineering to explicitly guide the model to perform intermediate steps (e.g., \"First, extract the two numbers. Then, subtract the second number from the first.\").\n5. **Check for Negatives:** Make sure the code can handle negative numbers.\n6. **Evaluate confidence scores:** If the confidence that an answer can be computed is below a certain threshold then respond that the answer cannot be computed.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 1:** solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information_extraction, solution_generation, decision_making\n*   **Sample ID 5:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n*   **Sample ID 7:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 9:** solution_verification\n",

This shows that the model failed at the most simple aspect of the task: subtracting 18 from 26.\n*   **Failure to Synthesize Information:** Sample ID 2 perfectly exemplifies the weakness in synthesizing information. The system explicitly states it's \"missing the critical step of calculating the difference,\" even though it has extracted both values. The model recognizes the need for subtraction but is unable to execute it, or determine if it is possible to execute it, and returns a \"cannot answer\" response.\n*   **Apparent Success with Simple Arithmetic:** Sample ID 3 highlights that it *can* do simple subtraction (2008 - 1937 = 71). The discrepancy in the model's ability to perform this simple task reveals that there may be some fragility or context dependence that hinders the model's execution, or that it has simply not been trained well enough to reliably execute this capability.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system demonstrates a limited understanding of the task requirements, managing to extract information and recognize the need for arithmetic operations in some cases. However, its arithmetic reasoning is unreliable, and it struggles with combining information from multiple sources.  Its current accuracy of 50% is unacceptable for production use. The system *can* extract information from passages, and *can* sometimes perform simple subtraction, but it cannot reliably do so, so the capability is extremely weak.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Information Extraction:**  It *can* successfully extract key pieces of information from the given context in some cases.\n*   **Task Recognition:**  The system attempts to determine the specific operation or reasoning required to answer the question.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Unreliable Arithmetic Reasoning:**  The inconsistency in performing subtraction, despite correctly identifying the values, is a critical flaw.\n*   **Inability to Synthesize Information:**  Failing to combine information pieces to answer questions limits the complexity of questions the system can handle.\n*   **Over-reliance on \"Cannot Answer\":**  The tendency to default to \"cannot answer\" indicates a lack of robustness and a failure to attempt inference when information is implicitly available.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Arithmetic Reasoning**, specifically subtraction reliability.  This is the most immediate bottleneck preventing accurate responses.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Develop Focused Arithmetic Test Suite:**  Create a new, rigorous test suite solely dedicated to arithmetic operations, with a large number of examples covering various number ranges, positive and negative numbers, and different sentence structures expressing the need for subtraction (e.g., \"difference between,\" \"how much larger,\" \"reduced by\").\n2.  **Implement Arithmetic Operation Unit Tests:**  Implement a comprehensive suite of unit tests specifically for arithmetic functions, particularly subtraction, to ensure accuracy and identify edge cases.  Use the focused arithmetic test suite to drive test case creation.\n3.  **Refine Subtraction Implementation:**  Review the existing subtraction implementation. Identify the most common error patterns to address them directly in the code.\n4. **Debug Arithmetic Logic:** Add print statements within the arithmetic functions to trace the values being used and the results produced at each step. This will help pinpoint exactly where the calculation is going wrong.\n5.  **Implement Information Fusion Module:** Develop a dedicated module responsible for identifying and combining relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the passage.

The accuracy is low and the error analysis reveals fundamental flaws.  Therefore, the current trend is **stable, but at an unacceptably low level of performance.**  Significant improvements are needed to shift the trend upwards.\n\nThis report provides a clear path for improvement, focusing on addressing the identified weaknesses and leveraging the existing strengths of the system.

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by combining LLM-driven information extraction and verification with deterministic schedule generation. It decomposes the problem into extraction, schedule generation, and verification stages, using `extract_meeting_info` to extract details, `generate_schedule` to propose a meeting time, and `verify_schedule` to validate the proposal. The `call_llm` function is the central function that interacts with the Gemini LLM to extract information and verify the schedule and the main function ties it all together to solve the problem. The overall workflow involves extracting meeting details, generating a schedule, verifying the schedule, and returning the result.",

This suggests that the primary issue isn't code execution failures, but rather errors in the reasoning and logic of the system.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Constraint Identification:** The system generally demonstrates the ability to identify constraints from the problem description (e.g., work hours, meeting duration, existing schedules).\n2.  **Availability Checking:** The system correctly checks the availability of individual participants for specific time slots.\n3.  **Invalid Schedule Detection:** The system can identify when a proposed time slot conflicts with a participant's existing schedule.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Lack of Iterative Solution Generation:** The system often stops after finding a single conflict, without attempting to find an alternative valid time slot. It doesn't seem to iterate through potential solutions effectively.\n2.  **Inability to Propose Valid Meeting Times:** The system frequently identifies that a proposed time is invalid but fails to generate a valid alternative, even when one exists. It gets stuck in a negative feedback loop, identifying conflicts but not recovering.\n3.  **Limited Search Horizon:** The system seems to be testing only a single, often the earliest, available time slot, without exploring the possibility of later, conflict-free slots.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Missing Iterative Solution Exploration:** The system lacks a mechanism to systematically explore alternative meeting times when the initial attempt fails.\n2.  **Premature Termination:** The system stops processing as soon as it finds a conflict, without trying other possible times.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe dominant pattern is that the system correctly identifies *why* an initial time slot is invalid but then fails to find a *valid* alternative. It gets stuck in a \"conflict detected, therefore invalid\" loop without actively searching for solutions. The system tends to check the *earliest* time slot and stops after detecting a single conflict, ignoring later availabilities.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **absence of an iterative and exhaustive solution generation process**. The system needs to actively generate and test multiple potential meeting times, not just stop at the first conflict encountered.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Solution Generation:** Implement an iterative algorithm that explores multiple possible meeting times.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** Ensure that all constraints (including preferences) are considered when generating and verifying potential solutions.\n3.  **Solution Verification:** Enhance the verification process to not only identify conflicts but also provide guidance for generating alternative solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Re-Act loop:** Use a ReAct pattern to Reason, Act (propose a time), Observe (check constraints), and then REACT (if invalid, propose a *different* time). Limit the loop with a `max_attempts` parameter to avoid infinite execution.\n2.  **Implement a Breadth-First Search of Time Slots:** Systematically check available time slots, starting from the earliest and moving forward.\n3.  **Introduce a \"backtracking\" mechanism:** If a conflict is found, record the conflict and try the next available time slot, ensuring that previously rejected slots are not re-evaluated unnecessarily.\n4.  **Implement Best-of-N approach:** Generate N possible meeting times and choose the best one based on constraint satisfaction.\n5.  **Use Few-Shot Examples Strategically:** Add examples to the prompt that demonstrate the iterative process of proposing a time, checking for conflicts, and proposing a *different* time if needed.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** solution\\_generation, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 1:** solution\\_generation, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 2:** solution\\_generation, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 3:** solution\\_generation, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 4:** solution\\_generation, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 5:** solution\\_generation, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 6:** solution\\_generation, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 7:** solution\\_generation, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 8:** solution\\_generation, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 9:** solution\\_generation, decision\\_making\n",

      "text_report": "## Capability Assessment Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The system demonstrates a basic understanding of the task (scheduling meetings with constraints) but fails to generate valid solutions due to a lack of iterative solution exploration. Its accuracy is currently 0%, indicating a fundamental flaw in its problem-solving strategy.\n\n**## RUNTIME ERROR PATTERNS**\n\nThe `raw_output` samples show no explicit runtime errors like JSON parsing failures or `TypeError`. This means the issues are not with code execution itself, but with the *logic* embedded within the LLM's reasoning or with the prompting strategy failing to elicit the desired behaviors. The fact that the system identifies busy participants suggests it's correctly parsing the constraints but failing to act on that information constructively. The absence of runtime errors makes prompt engineering and workflow refinement the focus of the next iteration.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n*   Constraint Identification: Correctly identifies participants' busy times.\n*   Availability Checking: Accurately determines if a proposed time conflicts with a schedule.\n*   Invalid Schedule Detection: Can recognize and report on conflicts.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n*   Solution Generation: Fails to generate valid alternative meeting times.\n*   Iterative Exploration: Lacks a mechanism to systematically explore multiple time slots.\n*   Premature Termination: Stops processing after finding a single conflict.\n*   Search Horizon: Focuses almost exclusively on the very first available time slot.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The ability to correctly extract and understand scheduling constraints is a crucial foundation. Maintain and build upon this by ensuring it can handle more complex constraint types (e.g., participant preferences, location constraints).\n*   **Availability Checking:** The ability to correctly identify schedule conflicts is vital.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Solution Generation:** The inability to find *any* valid meeting times, even when they exist, is the most critical flaw. This undermines the entire purpose of the system.\n*   **Iterative Exploration:** The lack of a systematic search for valid time slots is a core problem. The system needs to try multiple options.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\n*   **Solution Generation & Iterative Exploration:** Implement a robust mechanism for systematically exploring potential meeting times, proposing alternatives, and verifying them against constraints. This directly addresses the core issue of failing to find valid solutions.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement ReAct Pattern with Few-Shot Examples:**\n    *   Modify the prompt to use the ReAct pattern explicitly. This will encourage the LLM to \"think\" (reason), \"act\" (propose a time), \"observe\" (check for conflicts), and then \"react\" (propose a different time if needed).\n    *   **CRITICAL: Include *multiple* few-shot examples (3-5) in the prompt that demonstrate successful iterative scheduling.** These examples MUST show the system proposing an initial time, identifying conflicts, and then *explicitly generating and testing alternative times*. Examples are below.\n    *   Include a `max_attempts` parameter (e.g., 5-10) to prevent infinite loops if the LLM gets stuck.\n\n2.  **Prioritize Few-Shot Examples over Freeform Reasoning:**\n    *   Given the absence of runtime errors, focus on prompt engineering, particularly the use of targeted few-shot examples, rather than complex code changes. Guide the LLM's reasoning through concrete examples.\n\n3.  **Implement Time Slot Backtracking:**\n    *   Add a mechanism to record previously rejected time slots to prevent re-evaluation. This could be as simple as adding previously tried times to the prompt context (\"Do not propose these times again: [list of times]\").\n\n4. **Revise Capabilities Mapping:**\n    * The current assessment only specifies capability mapping with solution\\_generation, decision\\_making. Focus on a new capability mapping that utilizes solution generation and iterative exploration.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system is currently at a stable baseline (0% accuracy). Without significant changes to address the solution generation and iterative exploration weaknesses, the system's capabilities will remain stagnant. The suggested improvements should lead to a significant positive trend in the next iteration.\n\n**Few-Shot Examples (to be *included directly* in the prompt):**\n\n```\nExample 1:\nProblem: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Alice and Bob. Alice is available Monday 9:00-12:00. Bob is busy Monday 9:30-10:00.\n\nThought 1: I need to find a 30-minute slot where both Alice and Bob are available.\nAction 1: Propose Monday 9:00-9:30.\nObservation 1: Alice is available.

Bob is available.\n\nThought 3: I have found a valid time slot.\nAction 3: Finish. The meeting is scheduled for Monday 10:00-10:30.\n\nExample 2:\nProblem: Schedule a 60-minute meeting for Carol, David, and Eve. Carol is available Tuesday 14:00-16:00. David is busy Tuesday 14:30-15:30.

Eve is available.\n\nThought 2: Tuesday 14:00-15:00 is invalid. I need a *different* time. Because David is busy from 14:30, the earliest available time is 15:30.\nAction 2: Propose Tuesday 15:00-16:00.\nObservation 2: Carol is available. David is available. Eve is available.\n\nThought 3: Valid time found.\nAction 3: Finish. The meeting is scheduled for Tuesday 15:00-16:00.\n\nExample 3:\nProblem: Schedule a 30-minute meeting for Frank and Grace. Frank is available Wednesday 11:00-12:00. Grace is busy Wednesday 11:30-12:00.\n\nThought 1: I need a 30-minute meeting for Frank and Grace.\nAction 1: Propose Wednesday 11:00-11:30.\nObservation 1: Frank is available. Grace is available.\n\nThought 2: Time valid.\nAction 2: Finish. The meeting is scheduled for Wednesday 11:00-11:30.\n```\n\nBy focusing on the ReAct pattern and providing clear, iterative examples, you can guide the LLM to generate more effective solutions and significantly improve the system's overall accuracy.

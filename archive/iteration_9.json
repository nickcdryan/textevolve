  "approach_summary": "The script addresses factual questions using a \"Question Transformation & Focused Verification\" approach, leveraging the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem by first transforming the original question into simpler sub-questions, answering them individually using simulated search, and then synthesizing the answers. The script employs different agent roles (question transformer, search query generator, search engine, answer extraction expert, and answer synthesizer) to perform each of the steps. The main function orchestrates the process, calling `call_llm` to interact with the LLM for question transformation, search query generation, simulated search, answering sub-questions, synthesizing a final answer, and validating the result; the helper function `call_llm` centralizes calls to the Gemini LLM.",

The system's inability to answer stems from a lack of information retrieved from the search results and failures in question reformulation and subsequent search.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1. **Question Decomposition:** The system attempts to break down complex questions into smaller, more manageable sub-questions to facilitate information retrieval.\n2. **Acknowledging Limitations:** The system explicitly states when it cannot answer a question due to insufficient information, avoiding fabrication.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Information Retrieval Failure:** The system frequently fails to retrieve the specific information needed to answer the questions, even when the information is likely available online. This suggests issues with query formulation and search strategy.\n2. **Lack of Robustness in Question Transformation:** The system's question transformation strategy sometimes leads to less effective search queries, ultimately hindering information retrieval. In some cases, it even requests the user to provide information (like in sample_id 2, asking for the location from the previous question).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Ineffective Search Queries:** The inability to formulate effective search queries that retrieve the necessary information is the primary bottleneck. This could be due to poor keyword selection, lack of contextual understanding, or insufficient exploration of different search strategies.\n2. **Dependency on Perfect Information Retrieval:** The system relies heavily on retrieving complete and direct answers from the initial search results. It lacks the ability to synthesize information from multiple sources or make reasonable inferences when the answer isn't explicitly stated.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **\"I am unable to answer...\" Response:** This is a recurring theme, indicating a consistent failure in information retrieval and subsequent reasoning.\n2. **Escalating \"I don't know\" Responses:** The system often responds with \"I don't know\" at multiple stages of question decomposition, indicating a lack of accumulated knowledge or contextual awareness across sub-questions.\n3. **Dependency on Sub-question Results:** The system's reasoning becomes blocked if the results to even one sub-question return a null or vague answer.

This often leads to \"I don't know\" responses, even when the information seems likely to be available online (e.g., who was the first president of the Argentine Supreme Court).\n*   **Broken Chains of Reasoning:**  The reliance on sub-question results is problematic. If any sub-question fails to yield a suitable answer, the entire chain breaks down. Sample ID 2 demonstrates this perfectly, with the system needing the location from the previous turn and being unable to move on.\n*   **Question Transformation Issues:** While the attempt at question decomposition is positive, the transformed questions are not always optimal. Sometimes they are too specific or lack the necessary context for effective search. The transformation in Sample ID 2 is particularly problematic; asking for the location from question 3 when the system already failed at question 3 is an odd outcome.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling/Recovery:** The system doesn't attempt to handle failed search queries intelligently. It doesn't retry with different queries, try to synthesize information from multiple less-than-perfect sources, or adapt its reasoning strategy when encountering a dead end.\n*   **Excessive Verbosity/Redundancy:** The system often prefaces answers with statements like \"The search results do not contain the answer to the question.\" This adds unnecessary length and detracts from the user experience. The system says a variation of \"I am unable to answer\" multiple times per sample.\n* **Over-Reliance on search:** The system depends too much on external search and fails to reason when the answer isn't directly stated.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities in answering complex questions. Its core issue lies in reliably retrieving and synthesizing information from external sources. While it attempts question decomposition, the execution is flawed due to poor query formulation, lack of error handling, and an inability to reason beyond the immediate search results. The system's overall capability can be described as **nascent and unreliable.** Its accuracy score of 0/3 confirms this assessment.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Question Decomposition:** The attempt to break down complex questions is a valuable architectural decision that should be retained and improved.\n*   **Acknowledging Limitations:**  Avoiding hallucination by admitting when it cannot answer is crucial. This ethical behavior should be preserved.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval Failure:** Consistently failing to retrieve necessary information is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Robustness in Question Transformation:** Transformed questions are not always effective and can sometimes exacerbate information retrieval difficulties.\n*   **Inability to Synthesize Information:** The system cannot combine information from multiple sources or make inferences when a direct answer is unavailable.\n*   **Poor Error Handling and Recovery:** The system lacks mechanisms to retry failed searches, adapt its reasoning strategy, or handle incomplete information.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **information retrieval**. Without reliable information retrieval, all other components of the system are rendered ineffective.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Query Rewriting and Expansion Module:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Develop a dedicated module that analyzes the initial query and generates multiple variations. This should include:\n        *   Synonym expansion using a thesaurus or word embeddings.\n        *   Adding context from previous turns of the conversation.\n        *   Trying different question structures (e.g., \"What is X?\" vs. \"Define X\").\n        *   Removing unnecessary words or phrases that may be hindering search.\n    *   **Rationale:** This directly addresses the core problem of ineffective search queries.\n\n2.  **Implement a Multi-Pass Search Strategy with Result Analysis:**\n\n    *   **Action:** After the initial search (using multiple query variations from recommendation #1), analyze the top N results (e.g., top 5). Determine the relevance of each result based on keyword matching, semantic similarity, and other metrics. If the results are insufficient (e.g., low relevance scores), automatically refine the query (more aggressive synonym expansion, adding more context) and re-execute the search. Repeat this process for a maximum number of passes.\n    *   **Rationale:** Provides a more robust approach to information retrieval, increasing the chances of finding relevant information.\n\n3.  **Implement a Basic Information Fusion Module:**\n\n    *   **Action:**  After retrieving multiple relevant search results, develop a module that attempts to extract and synthesize key facts and relationships from these results. This could involve:\n        *   Identifying named entities and relationships between them.\n        *   Summarizing the content of each result.\n        *   Resolving conflicting information from different sources (e.g., by prioritizing more authoritative sources).\n    *   **Rationale:** Moves the system beyond simply regurgitating search results and towards actual reasoning and answering.\n\n4.  **Introduce Logging and Debugging Enhancements:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Add detailed print statements to the code at critical stages:\n        *   Before and after each question transformation.\n        *   Before and after each API call (search engine).\n        *   Before making any final decisions or providing the final answer.\n        *   Include information about the queries being executed, the raw search results, and the intermediate reasoning steps.\n    *   **Rationale:** Crucial for debugging and understanding why the system is failing in specific cases. The current lack of transparency makes it difficult to diagnose the root cause of errors.\n\n5.  **Reduce Verbosity and Redundancy:**\n\n    *   **Action:** Remove redundant phrases like \"The search results do not contain the answer to the question.\" and aim for more concise and direct responses.\n    *   **Rationale:** Improves the user experience and makes the system appear more intelligent.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0/3 accuracy), the capability trend is currently **stable and very low**. Significant improvements are needed to demonstrate any upward trend. Addressing the information retrieval weaknesses outlined above is crucial for driving positive change.\n",

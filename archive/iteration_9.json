  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM to directly transform the test grid based on patterns observed in training examples, without explicitly defining transformation rules. The problem is decomposed into transforming the grid and validating the output format. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates the process, calling `transform_test_grid` to generate the transformed grid and `validate_grid_format` to verify the output. `transform_test_grid` uses a multi-example prompt to guide the LLM to apply transformations observed in the training data. `validate_grid_format` uses the LLM to confirm that the output is a list of lists containing only integers. The overall workflow involves transforming the test grid using the LLM, validating the format of the transformed grid, and returning the transformed grid if it is valid, or an error message otherwise.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\n*   **Sample ID 1:** \"Error: Could not create a valid transformation\". This indicates a failure in `solution_generation`. The system could not produce a valid grid transformation based on the provided training examples. This might be due to an inability to generalize the pattern or an incomplete understanding of the transformation rules.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Underlying Structure:** The system correctly outputs a matrix/grid-like structure as its answer, aligning with the expected output format for this task.\n*   **Consistent Delimiters**: The response consistently uses ```python tags to enclose the grid.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The system struggles to generalize the transformation patterns observed in the training examples to the test input. It fails to identify and apply the correct logic for transforming the grid elements.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system does not seem to handle constraints effectively. In Sample ID 2, the final result does not match the golden answer.\n*   **Error Handling:** The system gives generic error messages instead of pinpointing the exact issue.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Generalization of Transformation Rules:** The primary bottleneck is the inability to generalize transformation rules from the training examples to the test input. This is especially evident in the first two cases where the system fails to output a grid.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** The system is not able to implement the correct constraints.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Inability to Adapt:** The core recurring pattern is the system's inflexibility. It seems to learn the training examples but cannot adapt those learnings to new, unseen input.\n*   **Transformation Failures**: There are recurring errors with the transformation process.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **inability to generalize grid transformation rules** from the training examples. The system either fails to identify the underlying pattern or cannot adapt the learned pattern to new input grids with different dimensions or element distributions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's ability to recognize and extract patterns from the training data. Implement more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms that can identify complex relationships between grid elements.\n2.  **Generalization Techniques:** Incorporate techniques that promote generalization, such as data augmentation, regularization, or meta-learning. Data augmentation can involve creating new training examples by slightly modifying existing ones.\n3.  **Debugging and Error Reporting:** Improve debugging and error reporting capabilities. Implement more detailed logging and error messages that pinpoint the specific step where the transformation process fails.

The output does show some pattern repetition. It consistently generates grids and uses ```python delimiters.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system throws a \"Could not create a valid transformation\" error. This suggests a fundamental problem in the transformation logic or data handling. The system fails entirely.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system produces a grid, but without the golden answer, it's impossible to know if this grid satisfies the constraints and transformation rules. The fact that a grid *is* produced implies partial functionality, but correctness is unknown.\n\nThe immediate issue is the complete failure in one of the three samples and the inability to assess correctness in the others.  The generic error message for Sample 1 is insufficient for debugging.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system's overall capability is extremely low, given the 0% accuracy rate.  It demonstrates a limited ability to generalize transformation rules and effectively handle constraints. While the system demonstrates structural formatting and uses ```python delimiters properly, the core transformation logic is unreliable.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structural Output:** The system consistently outputs a matrix/grid-like structure when it doesn't error.  This is a foundation to build upon.\n*   **Consistent formatting**: The system consistently uses ```python tags to enclose the grid.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Transformation Generalization:** The system's primary weakness is its inability to generalize transformation rules from training data to new inputs. This is reflected in the low accuracy score.\n*   **Error Handling & Reporting:** The generic error message \"Could not create a valid transformation\" provides insufficient information for debugging.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** There is no constraint handling.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Transformation Generalization**.  The system needs to be able to understand and apply transformation rules to new, unseen grid configurations.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere's a prioritized list of actionable changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Detailed Debugging and Logging:**\n    *   **Action:** Introduce detailed logging *within* the `solution_generation` module. This logging should capture intermediate states, variable values, and decision points during the transformation process.\n    *   **Rationale:**  This will make the root cause of failures easily identifiable. It will make debugging infinitely easier. The current error message provides almost zero information.\n    *   **Example:** Add `print()` statements showing the values of key variables at different stages of the transformation process (e.g., values from the input grid, identified patterns, applied transformations). Log these intermediate steps.\n2.  **Address Transformation Errors:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement a more robust error-handling mechanism within the transformation process. Specifically, when a transformation fails, the system should identify *why* it failed (e.g., pattern not found, incompatible input, constraint violation).\n    *   **Rationale:** This provides much-needed context and will guide development efforts.\n    *   **Example:** Instead of \"Could not create a valid transformation,\" the error message could be, \"Transformation failed: Pattern 'X' not found in input grid.\"\n3.  **Refine Pattern Extraction:**\n    *   **Action:** The original error analysis suggested CNNs and GNNs, however this is unecessarily complex at this stage. Try to increase the number of training samples, as well as the pattern complexity that the system is able to generate.\n    *   **Rationale:** More training data is key. This can be achieved by simply creating more patterns, or by generating the data via Data Augmentation.\n    *   **Example:** Create variations of the existing training examples by rotating, flipping, or scaling the grids. Introduce small random noise to the grid elements to make the system more robust to variations in the input.\n4.  **Implement a Constraint Handling Mechanism:**\n    *   **Action:** Add logic to explicitly check and enforce constraints within the transformation process.\n    *   **Rationale:** This ensures that the generated solutions meet the problem requirements.\n    *   **Example:** Before outputting a grid, implement a function that verifies whether it satisfies all the predefined constraints. If a constraint is violated, the system should attempt to modify the grid until all constraints are met.\n5.  **Testing Infrastructure**\n    *   **Action:** The tests should be self-evaluating, providing an automatic correctness metric.\n    *   **Rationale:** In the current form, the system only gives the raw outputs, without any kind of golden answer or evaluator to determine if the result is valid.\n    *   **Example:** Design the test cases with a golden answer and evaluation to allow for an accuracy calculation.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **declining**. The 0% accuracy indicates a significant lack of functionality. Without targeted improvements, the trend will likely remain negative.\n",

  "approach_summary": "This script uses a combination of LLM-based techniques including chain-of-thought reasoning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and iterative refinement with validation to answer questions. The problem is decomposed into query generation, search snippet retrieval, relevance validation, and answer generation. The script employs agent roles such as a query generator, search validator, problem solver, and solution validator.\n\nThe functions used are:\n*   `call_llm`: Makes calls to the Gemini LLM.\n*   `generate_query_and_validate`: Generates a search query and validates its effectiveness using LLM-based relevance checking.\n*   `generate_answer_with_snippets`: Generates an answer given search snippets\n*   `solve_with_validation_loop`: Solves the problem with iterative refinement via validation feedback; it calls `generate_query_and_validate` to obtain search snippets to be used by `generate_answer_with_snippets` and the LLM to provide/validate the answer.\n\nThe overall workflow involves generating an initial solution (potentially using search snippets), validating it, and iteratively refining it based on validation feedback until a valid solution is found or the maximum number of attempts is reached.",

The success cases demonstrate this ability.\n*   **Answer Formulation:** The system demonstrates the ability to formulate answers that include the golden answer within the text.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval/Search:** The system struggles to find the correct information to answer the question. This is evidenced by the \"Answer not found.\" response in the error case.\n*   **Date Identification:** The system appears to have difficulties in identifying dates in complex context and associating it with the event described in the question.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval/Search:** The system's inability to find relevant information is the most critical bottleneck. Without access to the necessary information, the system cannot generate the correct answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **\"Answer not found.\" responses:** The system resorts to \"Answer not found.\" when its search for relevant information fails. This suggests a lack of robustness in information retrieval and fact verification.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's failure to retrieve the necessary information from the available knowledge sources to answer the question about Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar's induction date.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Improving the system's ability to retrieve the correct information is crucial. This could involve using more sophisticated search techniques, improving the system's understanding of the question, and expanding the knowledge sources available to the system.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhance Search Techniques:** Implement more advanced search algorithms, such as semantic search, to better understand the meaning of the question and identify relevant documents.\n2.  **Improve Question Understanding:** Fine-tune the system's natural language processing (NLP) capabilities to better understand the question's intent, entities, and relationships.

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Overall Performance:** The AI system demonstrates moderate accuracy (67%) but suffers from critical weaknesses in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with date-related queries.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the Error Analysis Report. Two of the outputs successfully extract and present relevant information to answer the questions. However, the third output returns \"Answer not found,\" highlighting the system's failure to retrieve the necessary information in certain scenarios. The successful outputs demonstrate a clear \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" delimitation, indicating a consistent output format. The \"Answer not found\" output suggests that the system lacks a robust fallback mechanism when information retrieval fails. The successful answers contain information extracted verbatim from some knowledge source, suggesting that the system excels at direct information extraction but might struggle with synthesis or inference.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system possesses a basic capability for information extraction and answer formulation, particularly when the answer is readily available. However, its information retrieval capabilities are significantly lacking, especially when dealing with date extraction and complex contexts. This limitation severely restricts its ability to answer a wide range of questions. The system struggles to understand complex questions that require it to search for specific details, such as dates.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Direct Information Extraction:** The system can accurately extract information when it is explicitly present in the available resources.\n*   **Answer Formulation:** The system can format extracted information into a coherent and easily understandable answer, with proper delimiters.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:** The system's inability to find relevant information is a critical weakness. The \"Answer not found\" responses highlight this deficiency.\n*   **Date Identification:** The system appears to have difficulties in identifying dates in complex context and associating it with the event described in the question.\n*   **Lack of Robust Fallback Mechanism:** The absence of an effective fallback mechanism when information retrieval fails leads to unhelpful \"Answer not found\" responses.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Retrieval**. Addressing this bottleneck will directly increase the system's accuracy and usability.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Semantic Search:**  Replace or augment the current search algorithm with a semantic search approach. This would allow the system to understand the meaning of the question and identify relevant information even if the exact keywords are not present. *Action: Integrate a semantic search library (e.g., sentence transformers) and evaluate its performance on a diverse set of questions.*\n2.  **Fine-tune Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Dates:** Specifically train or fine-tune the NER component to more accurately identify and classify date entities, especially in complex contexts. *Action:  Use a larger dataset of text containing date information to fine-tune the NER model. Evaluate the performance of date recognition separately from other entities.*\n3.  **Implement a Fallback Mechanism:**  Instead of simply returning \"Answer not found,\" implement a fallback mechanism that provides a more helpful response. This could include:\n    *   Suggesting alternative search terms.\n    *   Providing a general answer related to the topic.\n    *   Indicating that the system could not find a precise answer and suggesting the user refine the query. *Action: Develop a fallback response generator that triggers when initial search fails.  Experiment with different fallback strategies and measure user satisfaction.*\n4.  **Implement a document ranking system**: Prioritize the most relevant documents based on a combination of factors such as keyword density, semantic similarity, and document source credibility. *Action: Research existing document ranking algorithms and integrate one into the system. Evaluate the performance of the ranking on a test dataset and refine as needed.*\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, it is difficult to assess the capability trend definitively. However, the current performance suggests that the system's capabilities are **stable but inadequate**. Improvements are needed to move towards a positive trend. Without changes, the capabilities will remain stagnant and the system will be of limited practical use.\n",

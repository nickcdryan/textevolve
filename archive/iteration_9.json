  "approach_summary": "This script uses a Chain-of-Thought approach to answer questions by decomposing the problem into three steps: determining the question type, extracting relevant information, and generating the answer. Each step uses a distinct LLM call with specific instructions to act as an expert in that area. The script uses the functions `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, and `generate_answer` to classify the question, retrieve necessary data, and produce a final answer respectively, facilitated by the `call_llm` function. The overall workflow involves sequentially calling these functions, passing the output of one as input to the next, to arrive at the final answer, with error handling at each step.",

A year later, Arsenal appeared in the FA Cup final for the second time in a row, defeating Aston Villa F.C. 4-0 in the 2015 FA Cup Final and becoming the most successful club in the tournaments history with 12 titles, a record which Manchester United would tie the following season. Arsenal later won the 2016-17 FA Cup for a record 13th time, defeating Chelsea 2-1 in the 2017 FA Cup Final and once more becoming the outright leader in terms of FA Cups won. The victory also saw Wenger become the first manager in English football history to win seven FA Cups. However, in that same season, Arsenal finished in the fifth position in the league, the first time they had finished outside the top four since before Wenger arrived in 1996. After another unspectacular league season the following year, Wenger announced his departure from the club on 20 April 2018, after 22 years as manager. His decision was met by responses of praise throughout English and world football from many pundits and former players, who also thanked him for developing them as people. His final home match in charge was a 5-0 win over Burnley where his entrance was met to a standing ovation by supporters.

After a scoreless first quarter and Robbie Gould's field goal, Charles Tillman intercepted Tony Romo, returning the pick for a touchdown. The interception would be the first of Romo's five interceptions. Romo would later hit Miles Austin for a 10-yard touchdown. In the second half, Cutler was able to hit Devin Hester on a 34-yard touchdown pass to extend the Bears lead. Later, Romo's pass was intercepted by Bears linebacker Lance Briggs, who then returned the interception for a touchdown to increase the lead 24-7.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Coming off of their Week 9 bye, the Patriots hosted the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday Night Football in a rematch of Super Bowl XLIX. The Patriots marched 75 yards in 9 plays on their first drive of the game, with LeGarrette Blount scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. Placekicker Stephen Gostkowski's kick went out of bounds, giving Seattle the ball at their own 40. The Seahawks reached the Patriots 8-yard line, but the Patriots red zone defense held them to a 26-yard field goal by placekicker Steven Hauschka and the score was 7-3. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Seahawks drove 66 yards in 10 plays, reaching the Patriots 13, but once again the Patriots kept them out of the end zone, and Hauschka kicked a 31-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 7-6. After another Patriots three-and-out, the Seahawks 65 yards in 10 plays, this time reaching the end zone on quarterback Russell Wilson's 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Doug Baldwin, but the PAT was blocked, keeping the score 12-7. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Gronkowski seemed to fumble after being hit hard by safety Earl Thomas, but replay overturned it. Two plays later, cornerback DeShawn Shead intercepted quarterback Tom Brady at the Seattle 22 and returned it 2 yards to the Seahawks 24. The Patriots forced Seattle to punt, then marched 81 yards in 11 plays, scoring on Blount's 1-yard touchdown run with 1:05 remaining in the first half. However, 1:05 was too much time for Seattle as they raced 75 yards in under a minute, with Wilson finding Baldwin wide open in the end zone for an 18-yard touchdown, giving Seattle a 19-14 lead at halftime. After a Seahawks three-and-out, the Patriots had their way with Seattle on 10 play, 91-yard drive, scoring on Blount's 13-yard touchdown run,re-taking the lead, 21-19.

Seattle countered with a long drive of their own, advancing 52 yards in 9 plays, taking a 22-21 lead on Hauschka's 41-yard field goal. The Patriots countered Seattle's field goal with one of their own, marching 63 yards in 10 plays, reaching the Seattle, but the Seahawks clamped down, and drove the Patriots back to the 12 and forced them to settle for Gostkowski's 30-yard field goal, retaking the lead 24-22. Seattle countered as well, racing 58 yards in 8 plays, reaching the New England 5, but the Patriots red zone defense once more kept them out of the end zone, and Hauschka was good from 23 yards away, his fourth, retaking the lead for Seattle, 25-24. Kickoff returner Cyrus Jones fumbled the kick return, but safety Nate Ebner recovered, but two plays later, after a 5-yard gain, safety Kam Chancellor forced wide receiver Julian Edelman to fumble, with Richard Sherman returning the ball 14-yards to the Patriots 48. Eight plays later, Wilson capped off the 48-yard drive with his touchdown pass to Baldwin, with a failed two point conversion, keeping the Patriots in the game 31-24. Facing a 3rd-and-10 at their own 46, Brady hit Edelman on a 30-yard bomb to the Seahawks 24. After a 4-yard loss by Blount, Brady hit Gronkowski on a 26-yard bomb to the Seahawks 2. Very close to the end zone, Brady gained 1-yard on the sneak attempt. But on the very next play, Blount was stuffed for no gain, bringing up 3rd-and-Goal at the 1. Brady tried to sneak again, but fumbled and recovered at the Seahawks 2. On 4th-and-Goal Gronkowski couldn't catch a pass from Brady and the Patriots turned it over on downs. The Seahawks ran out the final seconds and won the game. The Pats dropped to a record of 7-2, but still maintained first place in the AFC East. This would be the last loss of the Patriots season. The Seahawks improved to a record of 6-2-1.",

In the second quarter, the 'Boys got on the board as QB Tony Romo completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Washington would take the lead into halftime as kicker Shaun Suisham managed to get a 45-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Cowboys took the lead with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again on a 31-yard TD pass.  The Redskins got close as Suisham kicked a 39-yard field goal.  Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, the 'Boys started to run away with the lead as Romo and Owens hooked up with each other for a third time on a 46-yard TD pass.  Washington tried to come back as Suisham nailed a 44-yard field goal, yet Dallas continued to roll as Romo hooked up with Owens for the fourth time on a 52-yard TD pass.  The Redskins tried to come back as Campbell completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss.  Fortunately, the Dallas defense held on for the victory.

In the first quarter, Dallas shot first as QB Tony Romo completed a 15-yard TD pass to TE Tony Curtis.  Afterwards, the Giants responded with QB Eli Manning completing an 8-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey. In the second quarter, the Cowboys retook the lead as rookie kicker Nick Folk got a 44-yard field goal, yet New York answered with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 1-yard TD run.  Dallas reclaimed the lead with Romo completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.  However, due to a taunting penalty on LB Kevin Burnett, the Giants were given great field position to get some points prior to halftime.  The Cowboys held New York to a 40-yard Lawrence Tynes field goal. In the third quarter, Dallas regained the lead with Romo completing a 25-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants only got a 26-yard field goal from Tynes.  Afterwards, the Cowboys completed the season-sweep with Romo and Owens hooking up again on a 50-yard TD pass. This would mark the first time since their Super Bowl year of 1995 that the Cowboys began a season at 8-1, and only the third time in franchise history that Dallas began at 8-1; the other times were during the 1977 season, and the 1983 season.  The Cowboys won the Super Bowl in 1977 and 1995, but lost the wildcard game to the Los Angeles Rams in 1983. For their season-sweep over New York, Dallas had scored a total of 76 points in the two meetings.

The state debt peaked in 1994, when it reached US$14.4 billion. During 1998-2008 Bulgaria maintained policy of Government budget balance, which reduced the state debt to 5.07 billion euro. Combined with the economic growth in that period, the state debt dropped to a record low of 13.7% of GDP, one of the lowest in the European Union. In 2008 Bulgaria also maintained 4.286 billion euro fiscal reserve, meaning that net state debt at this moment was only 0.784 billion euro. After the Financial crisis of 2007\u201308 Bulgaria turned to policy of Deficit spending and at the end of 2013 the state debt rose up to 7.219 billion euro, representing 18.1% of the GDP. In 2015, the debt rate increased further to 26.7% of the GDP, still remaining the third lowest in EU after Estonia and Luxembourg.

This confirms the \"Overspecification\" error pattern highlighted in the error analysis. This suggests the system lacks the ability to precisely constrain its answers to the explicitly requested information.\n*   **Numerical Issues:** The error analysis mentions problems with numerical calculations. Although the provided output snippets don't directly showcase this (since they don't provide the prompts or context), the Sample 8 capability mapping indicates the system failed to extract and calculate points in the third quarter. This is a critical issue.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates competence in basic information extraction and entity recognition, but its ability to perform accurate calculations, synthesize numerical information, and generate precise answers is lacking. The system appears to struggle with questions requiring more than simple lookup or direct extraction. The system also displays a tendency to include extraneous information in its answers, deviating from the prompt's precise requirements.\n\nOverall capability: **Moderate**, with significant room for improvement in numerical reasoning and answer precision.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system can identify and extract relevant information from text.\n*   **Entity Recognition:** The system correctly recognizes entities (e.g., cities, people).\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Numerical Reasoning:** Inaccurate calculations and synthesis of numerical information.\n*   **Answer Precision:** Overspecification and inclusion of extraneous information in answers.\n*   **Complex Question Handling:** Struggles with questions requiring aggregation or comparison of multiple pieces of information.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Numerical Reasoning**. The system's inability to accurately calculate and synthesize numerical information directly impacts its accuracy and reliability.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no identified runtime errors in the provided 'output' fields of the error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Successful Information Extraction:** The system demonstrates a good ability to extract relevant information from the passage to answer questions, as seen in the success cases. The system can identify key details and facts necessary for generating correct answers.\n2.  **Numerical Comparison:** The system can perform basic numerical comparisons and identify the correct entities based on those comparisons (e.g., identifying the receiver with more yards).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Inaccurate Quantification:** The system struggles with accurately quantifying information, particularly when it involves combining information from different parts of the passage (e.g., calculating total scores across the game).\n2.  **Strict Interpretation of Answer Specifications:** The system can err when the golden answer is more restrictive or specific than what is minimally required. It provides extra information leading to incorrect answers.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Complex Calculation and Aggregation:** The system struggles when questions require complex calculations or aggregation of information scattered throughout the passage.\n2.  **Lack of Precision in Answer Generation:** The system occasionally provides more information than required, leading to incorrect answers by including extraneous elements.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Numerical Miscalculation:** The most frequent error is the incorrect calculation of numerical values, such as the score in the third quarter or failing to filter results.\n2.  **Overspecification:** Including extra information in the answer that isn't explicitly requested, leading to incorrect answers when compared to stricter golden answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the system's **inability to accurately perform calculations and synthesize numerical information from the provided passages.** This manifests in errors related to summing scores, comparing crime rates, and extracting precise numerical quantities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Enhanced Numerical Reasoning:** Strengthen the system's ability to perform arithmetic operations and synthesize numerical information from the passage.\n2.  **Answer Precision:** Improve the system's ability to generate answers that are precisely aligned with the question's scope and constraints, avoiding over-specification.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a Numerical Reasoning Module:** Develop a dedicated module responsible for extracting numerical data, performing calculations, and synthesizing information. This module should have error handling to prevent issues with incorrect calculations.\n2.  **Fine-tune Answer Generation:** Train the system to generate answers that are concise and directly address the question's prompt, avoiding unnecessary additions. Employ techniques like negative prompting or reward shaping to discourage over-specification.\n3.  **Add Intermediate Steps for Error Diagnosis:** Introduce more tracing and debugging information within the system, capturing the intermediate results of calculations and reasoning steps. This will enable better error diagnosis and allow for targeted improvements.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation. The system correctly identified Los Angeles but also included New York City.\n*   **Sample 8:** information_extraction, constraint_handling. The system failed to correctly extract the number of points in the third quarter and miscalculated.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nBased on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs, the following capability assessment is presented:\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several key issues that align with the provided error analysis.\n\n*   **Sample 1 Error (Overspecification):** The system correctly identified \"Los Angeles\" as a relevant city but also included \"New York City\". This confirms the \"Overspecification\" error pattern highlighted in the error analysis. This suggests the system lacks the ability to precisely constrain its answers to the explicitly requested information.\n*   **Numerical Issues:** The error analysis mentions problems with numerical calculations. Although the provided output snippets don't directly showcase this (since they don't provide the prompts or context), the Sample 8 capability mapping indicates the system failed to extract and calculate points in the third quarter. This is a critical issue.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates competence in basic information extraction and entity recognition, but its ability to perform accurate calculations, synthesize numerical information, and generate precise answers is lacking. The system appears to struggle with questions requiring more than simple lookup or direct extraction. The system also displays a tendency to include extraneous information in its answers, deviating from the prompt's precise requirements.\n\nOverall capability: **Moderate**, with significant room for improvement in numerical reasoning and answer precision.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system can identify and extract relevant information from text.\n*   **Entity Recognition:** The system correctly recognizes entities (e.g., cities, people).\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Numerical Reasoning:** Inaccurate calculations and synthesis of numerical information.\n*   **Answer Precision:** Overspecification and inclusion of extraneous information in answers.\n*   **Complex Question Handling:** Struggles with questions requiring aggregation or comparison of multiple pieces of information.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Numerical Reasoning**. The system's inability to accurately calculate and synthesize numerical information directly impacts its accuracy and reliability. Addressing this weakness will have the most significant positive impact on overall performance.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Prioritize Numerical Reasoning Module Development:** Immediately begin development and integration of a dedicated Numerical Reasoning Module as suggested.

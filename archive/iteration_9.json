  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by first extracting meeting details and participant schedules using LLM calls with example-based prompting. It then finds a potential time slot by iterating through possible times and checking for conflicts, and finally verifies the solution's validity using another LLM call. The problem is decomposed into information extraction, time slot searching, and solution verification, involving specialized LLM roles for each.",

    "error_analysis": {
      "text_report": "Okay, I'm ready to perform a thorough forensic analysis of the provided error cases. Here's my structured report:\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system is designed to identify when it *cannot* solve the problem, rather than confidently providing an incorrect answer. This shows a degree of self-awareness and prevents hallucination.\n2.  The prompt structure itself is well-designed, providing clear instructions and context for the LLM.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Failure to Extract Key Information**: The primary weakness is the consistent failure to extract the necessary information from the problem statement to begin solving it. This is evidenced by the recurring \"Could not extract meeting details.\" message.\n2.  **Lack of Robustness in Information Extraction**: The information extraction process is evidently not robust enough to handle variations in the input format or phrasing.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Meeting Details Extraction**: The most critical bottleneck is the initial step of extracting meeting details (participants, duration, available days/times). If this fails, the entire process grinds to a halt.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent \"Could not extract meeting details\"**: The system consistently fails at the initial information extraction stage. The error message indicates that the information required to schedule the meeting (participants, duration, timeframe) is not being correctly parsed from the input string.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **fragile and/or incomplete parsing logic for extracting meeting details from the input text**. The system relies on a specific input format, and even slight deviations cause the extraction to fail entirely. It appears the system is unable to handle the varying complexity and phrasings presented in the scheduling tasks. The system appears to be brittle, and likely uses rules, regex, or other non-LLM approaches instead of calling an LLM to perform extraction.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The information extraction capability requires significant improvement. It must be more resilient to variations in input phrasing and formatting. The parsing should be able to correctly extract participants, meeting duration, and the window of acceptable times/days from the given text. This *must* be implemented using an LLM approach.\n2.  **Constraint Handling**: While the core issue is extraction, improved constraint handling will be necessary once the primary issue is resolved. Error cases with preferences or specific day restrictions will require more sophisticated logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-driven Information Extraction:** Replace the current parsing logic with an LLM-driven approach. Prompt the LLM to extract specific information (participants, duration, timeframe, forbidden days) from the input text in a structured format (e.g., JSON). Use chain of thought prompting to improve LLM understanding and extraction.\n    *   *Example Prompt:* \"You are an expert information extractor. Your task is to extract the following information from the provided text and output it as a JSON object:\\n\\n*   participants: A list of the participants in the meeting.\\n*   duration: The duration of the meeting in hours.\\n*   available\\_days: A list of the days of the week the meeting can be scheduled on.\\n*   start\\_time: The earliest time the meeting can start.\\n*   end\\_time: The latest time the meeting can start.\\n*   forbidden\\_days: A list of days that the meeting cannot occur.\\n\\nText:\\n{question}\\n\\nOutput:\"\n2.  **Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement error handling for the LLM-driven extraction. If the LLM extraction fails or returns incomplete information, implement a fallback mechanism. This could involve prompting the LLM to re-extract with a slightly different prompt or using a simpler rule-based approach as a last resort.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement and Validation:** As you begin to incorporate LLMs, perform validation that intermediate steps are producing expected results (information extraction, constraint definition, final solution generation). Add self-checking capabilities for the LLM to verify its work.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 1**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 2**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 3**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 4**: information\\_extraction\n",

Its primary strength lies in its ability to recognize its inability to solve problems, preventing the generation of confidently incorrect answers.

    "error_analysis_text": "Okay, I'm ready to perform a thorough forensic analysis of the provided error cases. Here's my structured report:\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system is designed to identify when it *cannot* solve the problem, rather than confidently providing an incorrect answer. This shows a degree of self-awareness and prevents hallucination.\n2.  The prompt structure itself is well-designed, providing clear instructions and context for the LLM.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Failure to Extract Key Information**: The primary weakness is the consistent failure to extract the necessary information from the problem statement to begin solving it. This is evidenced by the recurring \"Could not extract meeting details.\" message.\n2.  **Lack of Robustness in Information Extraction**: The information extraction process is evidently not robust enough to handle variations in the input format or phrasing.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Meeting Details Extraction**: The most critical bottleneck is the initial step of extracting meeting details (participants, duration, available days/times). If this fails, the entire process grinds to a halt.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent \"Could not extract meeting details\"**: The system consistently fails at the initial information extraction stage. The error message indicates that the information required to schedule the meeting (participants, duration, timeframe) is not being correctly parsed from the input string.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **fragile and/or incomplete parsing logic for extracting meeting details from the input text**. The system relies on a specific input format, and even slight deviations cause the extraction to fail entirely. It appears the system is unable to handle the varying complexity and phrasings presented in the scheduling tasks. The system appears to be brittle, and likely uses rules, regex, or other non-LLM approaches instead of calling an LLM to perform extraction.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The information extraction capability requires significant improvement. It must be more resilient to variations in input phrasing and formatting. The parsing should be able to correctly extract participants, meeting duration, and the window of acceptable times/days from the given text. This *must* be implemented using an LLM approach.\n2.  **Constraint Handling**: While the core issue is extraction, improved constraint handling will be necessary once the primary issue is resolved. Error cases with preferences or specific day restrictions will require more sophisticated logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-driven Information Extraction:** Replace the current parsing logic with an LLM-driven approach. Prompt the LLM to extract specific information (participants, duration, timeframe, forbidden days) from the input text in a structured format (e.g., JSON). Use chain of thought prompting to improve LLM understanding and extraction.\n    *   *Example Prompt:* \"You are an expert information extractor. Your task is to extract the following information from the provided text and output it as a JSON object:\\n\\n*   participants: A list of the participants in the meeting.\\n*   duration: The duration of the meeting in hours.\\n*   available\\_days: A list of the days of the week the meeting can be scheduled on.\\n*   start\\_time: The earliest time the meeting can start.\\n*   end\\_time: The latest time the meeting can start.\\n*   forbidden\\_days: A list of days that the meeting cannot occur.\\n\\nText:\\n{question}\\n\\nOutput:\"\n2.  **Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement error handling for the LLM-driven extraction. If the LLM extraction fails or returns incomplete information, implement a fallback mechanism. This could involve prompting the LLM to re-extract with a slightly different prompt or using a simpler rule-based approach as a last resort.\n3.  **Iterative Refinement and Validation:** As you begin to incorporate LLMs, perform validation that intermediate steps are producing expected results (information extraction, constraint definition, final solution generation). Add self-checking capabilities for the LLM to verify its work.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 1**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 2**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 3**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 4**: information\\_extraction\n",

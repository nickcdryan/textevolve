  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to directly transform an input grid based on learned patterns from provided examples in a structured multi-example prompt, with the agent acting as a grid transformation expert. The problem is decomposed into direct transformation, output validation, and dimensionality checks. The script employs `call_llm` to interact with the LLM, `analyze_grid_transformation` to orchestrate the transformation and verification steps, and `main` to execute the overall process. The workflow is as follows: `main` calls `analyze_grid_transformation`, which uses `call_llm` to get the transformed grid and verifies its validity and dimensionality using `call_llm` again.",

The numbers in the grids represent different colors, and your job is to identify the underlying abstract pattern or rule used across all training example pairs and apply it to new test input.\n\n                                0: Black (sometimes interpreted as background/empty)\n                                1: Blue\n                                2: Red\n                                3: Green\n                                4: Yellow\n                                5: Gray\n                                6: Pink\n                                7: Orange\n                                8: Cyan\n                                9: Purple\n\n\n                                These tasks involve abstract reasoning and visual pattern recognition operations such as:\n                                - Pattern recognition and completion\n                                - Object identification and manipulation\n                                - Spatial transformations (rotation, reflection, translation, movement, groupings, sizes, etc.)\n                                - Color/shape transformations\n                                - Counting and arithmetic operations\n                                - Boolean operations (AND, OR, XOR)\n\n                                First, analyze each example pair carefully and examine the similarities across different example pairs. Look for consistent abstract rules across example pairs that transform each input into its corresponding output. There is a single meta rule or meta transformation sequence that applies to all the example training pairs. Then apply the inferred rule to solve the test case.\n\n                                Explain your reasoning and describe the transformation rule you've identified. Lastly, you MUST provide the output grid as the test output.\n\n\n                                \n                                Example 1:\nInput Grid:\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8,

Lastly, you MUST provide the output grid as the test output.\n\n\n                                \n                                Example 1:\nInput Grid:\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOutput Grid:\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\nExample 2:\nInput Grid:\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [6, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOutput Grid:\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [6, 0, 0, 6, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [3, 0, 0, 3, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\nExample 3:\nInput Grid:\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n  [3, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [2, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nOutput Grid:\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 6, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n  [3, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [2, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n=== TEST INPUT ===\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [9, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7]\n  [3, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\nTransform the test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a decomposed spatial analysis approach to transform grids, leveraging chain-of-thought prompting and verification. It breaks down the problem into identifying spatial features, analyzing transformation patterns based on these features, and then applying targeted transformations. The agent roles involved are spatial feature identifier, transformation pattern analyzer, and transformation applier and output verifier. The functions used are `main`, `identify_spatial_features`, `analyze_transformation_patterns`, `apply_targeted_transformations`, `verify_final_output`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling the feature identification, analysis, and transformation functions sequentially, and calls `verify_final_output` to verify the results, with `call_llm` being used to interact with the LLM in each of these functions.",

The system consistently generates outputs in the correct JSON format. However, the content within the grids is almost entirely incorrect, demonstrating a failure to accurately apply the underlying transformation rules.  The comments within the generated response also indicate a struggle in understanding how to transform the input grids into a new grid.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The output grid seems to be filled with mostly zeros, with some seemingly randomly placed 9's and 4's. There's no clear relationship between the input (unseen) and output.\n*   **Sample 1:** The text states \"spatial features were properly transferred,\" but the resulting grid is inaccurate. The presence of 2's and 8's bears no obvious relation to any input (unseen).\n*   **Sample 2:** Similar to Sample 0, the values (6, 2, 9, 7, 8, 3, 4, 1) appear to be placed somewhat randomly, failing to apply the correct constraints.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system's current capabilities are extremely limited. While it can generate outputs in the correct JSON format, it demonstrates a profound inability to:\n\n*   Understand and extract transformation rules from training examples.\n*   Apply learned transformations accurately to new input grids.\n*   Perform basic spatial reasoning related to element placement.\n*   Quantitative Reasoning (noting changes in numbers and location of these numbers)\n\nThe system currently fails to solve any of the grid transformation tasks. The accuracy of 0% is a stark indicator of this deficiency.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Format Adherence:** Consistent output in the required JSON format.\n*   **Intent for Spatial Preservation:** Tries to understand how to move numbers in the grid.\n*   **Basic Pattern Recognition:** Tries to identify patterns in training examples.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Extraction and Generalization:** Fails to accurately extract and generalize transformation rules.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Unable to reason about spatial relationships and element placement.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Does not accurately apply the rules and constraints extracted from training examples.\n*   **Inaccurate Transformation Logic:** Flawed transformation logic results in incorrect patterns being applied to the test input.\n*   **Lack of Quantitative Reasoning:** Inability to notice changes in numbers and location of numbers within grids.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Extraction and Generalization**.  Without accurate pattern extraction, all other attempts at improvement will be fundamentally limited. The model needs to understand *what* transformation is happening before it can accurately apply it. This includes the numbers in the grid, and their location relative to other numbers in the grid.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis, here are specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a dedicated Pattern Extraction Module:**\n    *   Design a module specifically for analyzing training examples and identifying explicit transformation rules. This module should take the input and output pairs of the training data as input.\n    *   Explore techniques like:\n        *   **Image processing techniques:** If the grids can be treated as images, explore edge detection, shape recognition, and feature extraction to identify patterns.\n        *   **Symbolic reasoning:** Represent the grids and transformations symbolically and use logical inference to deduce the underlying rules.\n        *   **Difference analysis:** Systematically compare input and output grids to identify differences and generalize the observed changes.\n2.  **Introduce Spatial Reasoning Components:**\n    *   Implement mechanisms for the system to understand spatial relationships between grid elements.\n    *   Consider using techniques like:\n        *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs can automatically learn spatial hierarchies and features from the grid data.\n        *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Represent the grid as a graph and use GNNs to learn relationships between elements.\n        *   **Attention mechanisms:** Implement spatial attention mechanisms to focus on relevant regions of the input grid during transformation.\n3.  **Constraint Validation:**\n    *   Before generating the final output, add a step to validate the proposed solution against the learned constraints.\n    *   This step should check if the generated output satisfies the identified transformation rules and any other constraints derived from the training examples.\n4. **Intermediate Reasoning Steps**\n    * Add print statements at each step of the solution to understand why an agent is moving the numbers around. This will allow for greater understanding of the transformation logic, and where it fails.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data (Accuracy: 0.00, Error samples: 3/3), the capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**.

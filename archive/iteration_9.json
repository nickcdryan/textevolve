  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by combining LLM reasoning with deterministic Python code to improve reliability. First, `extract_meeting_info` uses LLM with multi-example prompting to extract meeting details. Next, `convert_to_available_slots` converts these details into a structured list of available time slots using Python. Finally, `propose_meeting_time` uses LLM to propose an optimal meeting time, and `call_llm` is used to interact with the Gemini API. The overall workflow involves extraction, structuring, and proposal stages.",

The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags are present, showing a consistent output format. However, the proposed times are almost consistently incorrect, confirming the core problem lies in constraint handling and solution verification. The system is generating *some* time slot, but failing to ensure it satisfies *all* constraints and prioritizes the *earliest* option. There's no evidence in these outputs of any attempt to verify the proposed time against the schedules.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system exhibits a very low level of capability in scheduling meetings with constraints. While it can identify constraints and generate *a* time slot, it struggles to generate a *valid* and *optimal* time slot. The core weakness lies in constraint handling and verification, leading to a complete failure to meet the requirements of the scheduling task. The system seems to be performing at a near-random level, with an accuracy of 0%.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system maintains a consistent and valid output format. This is a minor strength but helps in downstream processing.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The system can *identify* some constraints, although it cannot *apply* them correctly.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The inability to accurately apply scheduling constraints is the most significant weakness.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The lack of a robust solution verification step is causing it to output invalid solutions.\n*   **Earliest Time Prioritization:** The system fails to consistently identify the *earliest* available valid time slot.\n*   **Preference Handling:** The system seems to completely ignore preferences, treating all constraints equally or not at all.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling.** Without accurate constraint handling, the system's suggestions are essentially useless. This requires a re-architecting of the constraint processing logic.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Constraint Database:** Create an internal data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries or a dedicated class) to represent each constraint explicitly. The structure should clearly indicate the type of constraint (availability, preference), the affected participant(s), and the time restrictions (e.g., \"Jesse is unavailable from 10:30 to 11:00\").\n2.  **Develop a `verify_solution` Function:** Implement the `verify_solution(proposed_time, constraints)` function suggested earlier. This function *must* iterate through *all* constraints and return `False` immediately if *any* constraint is violated.  A detailed log of constraint violations should be created *within* the `verify_solution` function to provide feedback to the solution generator. This log is critical for identifying which constraints are consistently being violated.\n3.  **Time Interval Representation:** Represent availability as time intervals (e.g., using `datetime` objects and time deltas). Use interval arithmetic to find the intersection of available times for all participants.\n4.  **Re-architect Solution Generation:** Refactor the solution generation logic to first generate *all* possible candidate time slots within the workday hours. Then, use the `verify_solution` function to filter out invalid time slots. From the remaining valid time slots, select the *earliest* time.\n5. **Few-Shot Examples Revision:** Revise the few-shot examples in the prompt to specifically demonstrate the constraint handling, solution verification, and earliest time prioritization. Include examples with negative constraints (e.g., \"cannot meet on Tuesday\").\n6.  **Prioritize Availability Constraints:** Explicitly separate availability constraints from preference constraints. Hardcode availability constraints as required.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **stable at a very low level of performance.** The system consistently fails to produce valid scheduling suggestions. Without significant architectural changes focusing on constraint handling and verification, there is no reason to expect improvement.\n",

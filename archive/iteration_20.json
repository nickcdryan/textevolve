  "approach_summary": "This script addresses factual questions using an LLM-driven approach that includes question transformation, knowledge base retrieval (simulated), and a verification loop. The problem is decomposed into transforming the initial question into a more specific query, simulating a knowledge base search based on the transformed query, and then verifying if the retrieved information accurately answers the original question. Three agents are involved: a question transformation expert, a knowledge base, and an expert validator. The functions used are `call_llm` to interact with the LLM with `main` calling `call_llm` three times sequentially for question transformation, knowledge base retrieval, and verification. The overall workflow transforms the question, retrieves information, and validates the answer.",

For example, in the \"Eddington Medal\" question, filter the results to only include winners from 1993.\n3.  **Temporal Reasoning Module:** Create a dedicated module to handle temporal reasoning, allowing the system to understand and apply temporal constraints effectively. This module can parse dates, identify temporal relationships, and filter results based on time periods.\n4. **Knowledge Base Validation:** Establish a process for validating the accuracy and currency of information within the knowledge base.

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nBased on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and improvement suggestions, here is a thorough capability assessment:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs confirm the error analysis.  The system successfully isolates text spans using `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags, demonstrating a basic extraction capability. However, the extracted spans contain incorrect information in all three cases. This indicates a problem *before* the answer is finalized \u2013 either during information retrieval, ranking, or a later filtering/validation stage. The system *attempts* to answer but fundamentally fails to provide correct responses. The uniform presence of the answer extraction tags, even with incorrect answers, is a consistent behavior.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates **very low overall capability** in question answering. While it can perform basic text extraction and partially identify relevant information, it consistently fails to select the correct, precise, and contextually appropriate answer. The accuracy of 0% clearly highlights the urgent need for significant improvements. The system demonstrates some ability to retrieve information related to the topic of the question, but lacks the crucial ability to refine and validate its answers.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Answer Extraction:** The system consistently uses `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags to delineate a potential answer, which provides a predictable structure for output parsing. This is a good foundation to build upon.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Answer Selection Accuracy:** The system demonstrably fails to select the correct answers from its knowledge base, suggesting significant problems with retrieval, ranking, filtering, and/or validation. This is the most crucial area needing improvement.\n*   **Contextual Reasoning:** The system struggles to incorporate contextual information (temporal constraints, specific details) into its answer selection process, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete responses.\n* **Knowledge Base Dependency:** The correctness of the answers is entirely dependent on the knowledge base. The fact that incorrect information is returned suggests a problem with the accuracy and/or currency of the knowledge base.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Answer Selection Accuracy**. The system needs a significantly improved mechanism for retrieving, ranking, filtering, and validating potential answers based on relevance, specificity, and contextual appropriateness.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis, implement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a Scoring Function for Answer Candidates (with Logging):** Implement the proposed scoring function, incorporating semantic similarity, keyword presence, constraint fulfillment (especially temporal), and source reliability. CRITICALLY: **Add detailed logging to this function to track the score assigned to each candidate answer and the reasons for those scores.** This is necessary to diagnose why the correct answer is being overlooked.\n2.  **Introduce a Filtering Step (with Logging):** After retrieving candidate answers, filter them based on constraints extracted from the question. Focus initially on temporal constraints. Again, **add detailed logging to show which candidates are filtered out and why.** This will help isolate problems with constraint extraction or filtering logic.\n3.  **Implement a Basic Knowledge Base Validation Check:** Before deploying the system, implement a simple check to flag potential inaccuracies in the knowledge base. For example, cross-reference information with a trusted external source for a small sample of questions.\n4. **Add Print Statements Throughout Execution:** As suggested, add print statements throughout the execution flow, particularly within the retrieval, ranking, and filtering steps. This will provide valuable insights into the decision-making process and aid in identifying the root cause of errors. Capture the intermediate states of key variables and the rationale behind each decision.\n5.  **Focus on a Single Error Case:** Due to the low accuracy, focus the next iteration on fixing just ONE of the three error cases (e.g., the Eddington Medal question). Getting one question right with verifiable reasoning is better than failing at all three.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **stable at a very low level (0% accuracy)**. Without significant changes and debugging, the system will continue to perform poorly. The logging and debugging recommendations are *essential* to identify and address the root causes of the errors and start seeing improvement.\n",

Outdated information can lead to selecting incorrect answers, such as in the \"Eddington Medal\" example.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a scoring function for answer candidates:** This function should consider factors such as:\n    *   Semantic similarity between the answer and the question.\n    *   The presence of relevant keywords and entities.\n    *   The fulfillment of any explicit or implicit constraints (e.g., temporal constraints, specific dates).\n    *   The source reliability for the candidate answer.\n2.  **Introduce a filtering step:** After retrieving a set of candidate answers, filter them based on the constraints extracted from the question. For example, in the \"Eddington Medal\" question, filter the results to only include winners from 1993.\n3.  **Temporal Reasoning Module:** Create a dedicated module to handle temporal reasoning, allowing the system to understand and apply temporal constraints effectively. This module can parse dates, identify temporal relationships, and filter results based on time periods.\n4. **Knowledge Base Validation:** Establish a process for validating the accuracy and currency of information within the knowledge base. This could involve automated checks against external sources or manual review by domain experts.\n5. **Add Print Statements:** Add print statements that show the reasoning as it executes. This would allow for detailed analysis of why things went wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracted \"2023\" but missed \"Sep 07\")\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed to identify the need for a specific date.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the answer's semantic equivalence.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct winner of the Eddington Medal in 1993.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect solution.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the answer against known facts.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct player who scored all the conversions for Spain in the specified match.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect solution.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the answer against known facts.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nBased on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and improvement suggestions, here is a thorough capability assessment:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs confirm the error analysis.  The system successfully isolates text spans using `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags, demonstrating a basic extraction capability. However, the extracted spans contain incorrect information in all three cases. This indicates a problem *before* the answer is finalized \u2013 either during information retrieval, ranking, or a later filtering/validation stage. The system *attempts* to answer but fundamentally fails to provide correct responses. The uniform presence of the answer extraction tags, even with incorrect answers, is a consistent behavior.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates **very low overall capability** in question answering. While it can perform basic text extraction and partially identify relevant information, it consistently fails to select the correct, precise, and contextually appropriate answer. The accuracy of 0% clearly highlights the urgent need for significant improvements. The system demonstrates some ability to retrieve information related to the topic of the question, but lacks the crucial ability to refine and validate its answers.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Answer Extraction:** The system consistently uses `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags to delineate a potential answer, which provides a predictable structure for output parsing. This is a good foundation to build upon.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Answer Selection Accuracy:** The system demonstrably fails to select the correct answers from its knowledge base, suggesting significant problems with retrieval, ranking, filtering, and/or validation. This is the most crucial area needing improvement.\n*   **Contextual Reasoning:** The system struggles to incorporate contextual information (temporal constraints, specific details) into its answer selection process, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete responses.\n* **Knowledge Base Dependency:** The correctness of the answers is entirely dependent on the knowledge base. The fact that incorrect information is returned suggests a problem with the accuracy and/or currency of the knowledge base.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Answer Selection Accuracy**. The system needs a significantly improved mechanism for retrieving, ranking, filtering, and validating potential answers based on relevance, specificity, and contextual appropriateness.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis, implement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a Scoring Function for Answer Candidates (with Logging):** Implement the proposed scoring function, incorporating semantic similarity, keyword presence, constraint fulfillment (especially temporal), and source reliability. CRITICALLY: **Add detailed logging to this function to track the score assigned to each candidate answer and the reasons for those scores.** This is necessary to diagnose why the correct answer is being overlooked.\n2.  **Introduce a Filtering Step (with Logging):** After retrieving candidate answers, filter them based on constraints extracted from the question. Focus initially on temporal constraints. Again, **add detailed logging to show which candidates are filtered out and why.** This will help isolate problems with constraint extraction or filtering logic.\n3.  **Implement a Basic Knowledge Base Validation Check:** Before deploying the system, implement a simple check to flag potential inaccuracies in the knowledge base. For example, cross-reference information with a trusted external source for a small sample of questions.\n4. **Add Print Statements Throughout Execution:** As suggested, add print statements throughout the execution flow, particularly within the retrieval, ranking, and filtering steps. This will provide valuable insights into the decision-making process and aid in identifying the root cause of errors. Capture the intermediate states of key variables and the rationale behind each decision.\n5.  **Focus on a Single Error Case:** Due to the low accuracy, focus the next iteration on fixing just ONE of the three error cases (e.g., the Eddington Medal question). Getting one question right with verifiable reasoning is better than failing at all three.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **stable at a very low level (0% accuracy)**. Without significant changes and debugging, the system will continue to perform poorly. The logging and debugging recommendations are *essential* to identify and address the root causes of the errors and start seeing improvement.\n"

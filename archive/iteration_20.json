  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using an LLM to analyze training examples and generate coordinate-based transformation rules. The problem is decomposed into analyzing the grid (`analyze_grid_transformation`) and applying the transformations (`apply_coordinate_transformation`). Two agent roles are employed: one for analyzing visual features and generating rules, and another for applying these rules to the test grid. The function `call_llm` interfaces with the Gemini API. The overall workflow involves calling `analyze_grid_transformation` to get transformation rules, then calling `apply_coordinate_transformation` to apply these rules and output the transformed grid, orchestrated by `solve_grid_transformation` and `main`.",

The '3's seem to be placed somewhat related to the '8's, but not accurately or consistently. The '2's don't appear to follow a clear logic. There's a potential attempt to maintain some of the '8's from the input, but it's inconsistent.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system appears to try to populate the grid with '2's based on the presence of other numbers, but it misses the underlying pattern entirely. It demonstrates a complete failure to generalize a valid transformation.\n*   **Inconsistent Formatting:** While the system mostly adheres to the requested grid format, there are inconsistencies. In Sample ID 0, some rows contain '0' while in sample ID 2, other numbers like '4' and '1' are used despite never appearing as valid outputs in other training samples.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary ability to follow formatting instructions and attempt pattern recognition. However, its overall capability is severely limited by its inability to accurately identify, abstract, and generalize transformation rules. The system's performance is erratic and unpredictable. It struggles to apply consistent constraints across the grid and often generates outputs that deviate significantly from the expected results. The system understands the general nature of the task (transforming a grid) but fails to execute the core logic of *how* to transform the grid correctly.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Format Adherence:** The system generally produces output that conforms to the expected grid-like structure.\n*   **Pattern Recognition Attempt:** The system attempts to identify and apply patterns observed in the training data, even if it does so incorrectly. This indicates some basic learning is taking place.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Misinterpretation:** The system consistently fails to accurately identify the underlying transformation patterns. This is the primary cause of errors.\n*   **Generalization Failure:** The system struggles to generalize learned patterns to different grid sizes and arrangements, indicating a lack of robust learning.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Constraints:** Transformation rules are not applied consistently across the entire grid, leading to discrepancies and invalid outputs.\n*   **Lack of Numerical Precision:** Incorrect numbers appear in the output, highlighting errors in the transformation logic.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Abstraction**. The system *must* be able to accurately identify the relationship between input and output grids in the training data. Without accurate pattern recognition, generalization and constraint enforcement become irrelevant.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Rule-Based Pattern Extraction Module:** Instead of relying solely on neural networks (if applicable), introduce a rule-based module that explicitly defines potential transformation rules based on spatial relationships between numbers in the training data. For example, the module could check for rules like \"if an 'X' exists at [row, col], then a 'Y' should be placed at [row+1, col-1]\". Consider using image processing techniques for feature extraction as well. This is preferable to the current approach, which leads to misinterpretations.\n2.  **Introduce a Spatial Relationship Encoding:** Before feeding data to the system, encode the spatial relationships between numbers in the input grid. For example, represent the relative positions of '8's, '2's, and '3's as a graph. This will help the system better understand the context of each number.\n3.  **Implement a Constraint-Satisfaction Layer:** After generating a potential output grid, pass it through a constraint-satisfaction layer that checks for consistency with the identified transformation rules. This layer should have the ability to modify the grid to enforce the constraints, resolving conflicts where necessary. Focus the first constraint-satisfaction attempts on simple constraints like matching the output set of possible numbers in the output grid.\n4.  **Debugging with Visualizations:** Create visualizations of the training data and the system's internal representation of the transformation rules. This will help developers understand how the system is learning and identify areas where it is failing.\n5.  **Focus Training Examples:** Start with training examples that have very simple, clearly defined rules. Increase the complexity incrementally. This will make it easier for the system to learn the basics before tackling more challenging patterns.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but low**. While it shows some potential, it is not accurately solving the problem and its performance is limited. Without significant improvements to its pattern recognition and abstraction capabilities, the system will remain ineffective. The actionable recommendations provided aim to initiate an **improving trend**.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM-driven \"Rule Generation and Analogy\" approach. It decomposes the problem into three steps: rule generation, analogy selection, and transformation application. Three LLM agents are used: one to generate the transformation rule based on examples, another to select the best analogy from training examples, and a third to apply the transformation rule to the original problem based on the selected analogy. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini LLM API. The overall workflow involves generating a rule (`rule_generation_prompt`), selecting the best analogy (`analogy_selection_prompt`), and then applying the transformation (`transformation_application_prompt`) using the LLM.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI SYSTEM\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal significant issues in the system's ability to solve the abstract reasoning tasks.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Incorrect Rule Extraction:** The \"Extracted rule\" sections are often flawed.  The system attempts to describe the transformation but fails to capture the underlying logic accurately. For example, in Sample ID 0, the description focuses on changing '1' values around '8' values to '3', but the generated code then hardcodes these changes to specific indices in the input grid, rather than generalizing the spatial relationship. Sample ID 2 tries to relate it to row number.\n*   **Overly Specific Code:** The generated Python code demonstrates a severe lack of generalization. The code often hardcodes conditions based on specific values and their locations within the *training* grids. It doesn't create a flexible algorithm that can adapt to different grid sizes or value arrangements in the *test* input. The code includes a multitude of `if` statements checking for particular values at particular indices. This suggests the system is essentially memorizing the training data instead of learning the underlying rules.\n*   **Failure to Apply Constraints Dynamically:** The system struggles with constraints that involve relationships between different parts of the grid. The hardcoded logic prevents it from dynamically evaluating these relationships.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates *very limited* capabilities in abstract reasoning. While it can extract some basic information and generate code, its inability to generalize patterns and handle constraints effectively results in consistently incorrect solutions. The system is essentially overfitting to the training examples.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can produce syntactically correct Python code. (However, the semantic correctness is severely lacking).\n*   **Basic Information Extraction:** It can identify grid dimensions and some of the values within the grids.\n*   **Analogy Attempt:** The system attempts to find analogies between the input and output examples.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization (Critical):** The inability to generalize patterns is the most significant weakness. It prevents the system from adapting to new inputs.\n*   **Code Abstraction (Critical):** Generated code is too specific and lacks modularity. It's tightly coupled to the training examples.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** It fails to accurately identify and apply constraints effectively.\n*   **Incorrect Mapping:** The system incorrectly maps the transformed rules from training examples to test input.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **Pattern Generalization**. Without significant improvements in this area, the system will remain fundamentally incapable of solving abstract reasoning tasks.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are concrete changes to implement in the next iteration, focused on improving pattern generalization:\n\n1.  **Introduce Symbolic Reasoning:**\n    *   **Implement:** Use a symbolic representation for patterns. For example, instead of identifying \"change '1' at (7,2) to '3'\", represent it as \"change the cell adjacent to an '8' to '3'\".  This will require a system to first identify adjacency relationships.\n    *   **Action:**  Develop a module that can translate grid configurations into symbolic representations of patterns and relationships.\n2.  **Implement Spatial Relationship Encoding:**\n    *   **Implement:** Focus on extracting spatial relationships between objects within the grid, such as \"above\", \"below\", \"left of\", \"right of\", \"adjacent to\", and \"distance between.\"\n    *   **Action:**  Modify the pattern recognition module to explicitly encode spatial relationships into the symbolic representation of a pattern.\n3.  **Meta-Learning/Few-Shot Learning:**\n    *   **Implement:**  Explore meta-learning techniques to learn how to learn from a small number of examples.  This could involve training the system on a large dataset of abstract reasoning problems to learn a prior that helps it generalize from few examples.\n    *   **Action:**  Investigate meta-learning algorithms like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) or Reptile.\n4.  **Modular Code Generation:**\n    *   **Implement:** Generate code in modular functions, each responsible for a specific sub-task (e.g., `find_all_8s`, `get_adjacent_cells`, `transform_cell`).  This improves reusability and adaptability.\n    *   **Action:** Refactor the code generation process to produce smaller, more focused functions.\n5.  **Implement Intermediate Print Statements During Training:**\n    *   **Implement:** Include print statements to show intermediate reasoning steps.\n    *   **Action:** Implement logging or debugging statements within the code generation and execution phases to track the system's reasoning process. This will help identify where the system is going wrong in its pattern identification and application.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the 0% accuracy, the capability trend is currently **declining or stable at a very low level**. Significant investment in the areas outlined above is needed to see improvement.\n",

Without significant improvements in this area, the system will remain fundamentally incapable of solving abstract reasoning tasks.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are concrete changes to implement in the next iteration, focused on improving pattern generalization:\n\n1.  **Introduce Symbolic Reasoning:**\n    *   **Implement:** Use a symbolic representation for patterns. For example, instead of identifying \"change '1' at (7,2) to '3'\", represent it as \"change the cell adjacent to an '8' to '3'\".  This will require a system to first identify adjacency relationships.\n    *   **Action:**  Develop a module that can translate grid configurations into symbolic representations of patterns and relationships.\n2.  **Implement Spatial Relationship Encoding:**\n    *   **Implement:** Focus on extracting spatial relationships between objects within the grid, such as \"above\", \"below\", \"left of\", \"right of\", \"adjacent to\", and \"distance between.\"\n    *   **Action:**  Modify the pattern recognition module to explicitly encode spatial relationships into the symbolic representation of a pattern.\n3.  **Meta-Learning/Few-Shot Learning:**\n    *   **Implement:**  Explore meta-learning techniques to learn how to learn from a small number of examples.  This could involve training the system on a large dataset of abstract reasoning problems to learn a prior that helps it generalize from few examples.\n    *   **Action:**  Investigate meta-learning algorithms like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) or Reptile.\n4.  **Modular Code Generation:**\n    *   **Implement:** Generate code in modular functions, each responsible for a specific sub-task (e.g., `find_all_8s`, `get_adjacent_cells`, `transform_cell`).  This improves reusability and adaptability.\n    *   **Action:** Refactor the code generation process to produce smaller, more focused functions.\n5.  **Implement Intermediate Print Statements During Training:**\n    *   **Implement:** Include print statements to show intermediate reasoning steps.\n    *   **Action:** Implement logging or debugging statements within the code generation and execution phases to track the system's reasoning process. This will help identify where the system is going wrong in its pattern identification and application.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the 0% accuracy, the capability trend is currently **declining or stable at a very low level**. Significant investment in the areas outlined above is needed to see improvement.\n"

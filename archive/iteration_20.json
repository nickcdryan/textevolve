  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions by analyzing the question, extracting relevant information, generating an initial answer, and then verifying the answer, potentially involving calculations. The problem is decomposed into question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The LLM acts as an expert in each stage, guided by specific system instructions and few-shot examples.\n\nKey functions include: `main` (orchestrates the workflow), `analyze_question` (identifies question type and keywords), `extract_relevant_passage` (extracts relevant text), `generate_answer` (generates the initial answer), `verify_answer` (verifies and potentially calculates the answer), and `call_llm` (interacts with the LLM). The `main` function calls the other functions in sequence, passing the results from one to the next to refine the answer. The workflow starts with question analysis, uses that to extract the relevant passage, and then utilizes both of those to generate and verify the final answer.",

There were then 37 sugar factories, 99 cotton factories, and 4 coffee factories.  After nutmeg was discovered in 1768, 40 nutmeg plantations were started.

In the second quarter the Cardinals trailed early as QB Brett Favre got a 12-yard TD pass to RB Adrian Peterson.

The Cardinals replied a took the lead with QB Derek Anderson completing a 30-yard TD pass to WR Andre Roberts. This was followed by DB Michael Adams returning a fumble 30 yards for a touchdown, and with kicker Jay Feely making a 22-yard field goal. The lead was closed down by Peterson as he got a 4-yard TD run, and by QB Brett Favre's 25-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe.

It exhibits potential for complex reasoning. However, its weakness lies in understanding the question's intent and formatting the answer to match the expected output. This deficiency significantly impacts its overall effectiveness. It appears the system's core function is information extraction and basic calculation, and it lacks a sophisticated layer of question understanding and response generation to tie these components together effectively.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction Accuracy:** Consistently extracts relevant numerical data from the provided passage.\n*   **Calculation Ability:** Performs arithmetic operations correctly when identified as necessary.\n*   **Transparent Reasoning:** Provides justifications for its calculations (e.g., \"1472 - 1470 = 2\").\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Question Intent Misinterpretation:** Fails to fully grasp what the question is asking and the level of detail expected in the answer.\n*   **Output Formatting Inconsistency:** Provides answers in a format that does not align with the question's expectations (e.g., providing multiple values when one aggregate number is required).\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** Difficulty understanding the relationships between the extracted data and how it should be combined.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Question Understanding**. Without a solid understanding of the question's intent, the system's other strengths are rendered less useful. Improved question understanding will drive better answer generation and formatting.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Question Type Classification:** Implement a module that categorizes questions into predefined types (e.g., \"summation,\" \"comparison,\" \"specific value lookup,\" \"average calculation\"). This will help the system anticipate the required output format.\n    *   **Action:** Train a classification model on a dataset of questions with manually assigned types. This could leverage existing NLP techniques like transformer models.\n\n2.  **Develop a Rule-Based Formatting Layer:** Based on the identified question type, apply a set of rules to format the answer appropriately.\n    *   **Action:** Create a set of rules like:\n        *   IF question\\_type == \"summation\" THEN sum\\_relevant\\_values.\n        *   IF question\\_type == \"comparison\" THEN compare\\_values\\_and\\_return\\_boolean.\n        *   IF question\\_type == \"specific\\_value\\_lookup\" THEN return\\_single\\_value.\n    *   **Action:** Design and implement this layer to sit *between* the information extraction and the output generation modules.\n\n3.  **Introduce a Contextual Reasoning Step:** After extracting information, but before generating the answer, incorporate a step that analyzes the relationships between the extracted data points and the context of the question.\n    *   **Action:** Explore using knowledge graphs or semantic networks to represent the relationships between entities and concepts in the input text. This could facilitate reasoning about how to combine the extracted data.\n    *   **Action:** Add a \"reasoning trace\" to the output, detailing the steps the system took to arrive at the answer. This will aid in debugging and understanding its decision-making process.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance summary and the analysis of the execution outputs, it's difficult to definitively say whether the capabilities are improving, declining, or stable *without previous reports*. However, the current state indicates a system with foundational capabilities that are limited by a lack of higher-level reasoning and question understanding. Implementing the actionable recommendations should lead to a positive upward trend in future iterations.\n",

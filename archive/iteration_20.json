  "approach_summary": "The script implements a \"Transformation by Component-Wise Analysis and Rule Application\" approach to transform a grid. It decomposes the problem into transforming rows and columns independently, using the `transform_rows` and `transform_cols` functions which act as specialized agents. These agents call the `call_llm` function to generate transformations based on training examples and a test input, guided by system instructions. The `preprocess_question` function extracts training examples and test input. Finally, the transformed rows and columns are combined to produce the final transformed grid.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample outputs, and your requirements.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe system consistently fails to produce the correct grid transformations as indicated by the 0% accuracy. Despite format adherence, the *content* of the outputs is incorrect.  Specific observations:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output grid bears little resemblance to the expected transformation. The presence of '8' in many cells is not explained by training examples (based on the error analysis).  It appears to be a largely arbitrary grid.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system hallucinates the need for Python code when a simple grid output is expected. It incorrectly interprets the problem and outputs code that extracts only a portion of the input grid without performing the desired transformation. This is a significant abstraction failure. The code is syntactically correct but logically irrelevant.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The output is again an incorrect grid.  The placement of '2's and '3's appears random and unrelated to any logical transformation of the input. There are also a large amount of zeros in this grid.\n\nThe analysis points to a fundamental misunderstanding of the task objective and a severe deficiency in pattern recognition and application. The model produces outputs, suggesting it's \"doing something,\" but that something is not aligned with the intended goal.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates *very limited* capability in solving grid transformation problems. While it shows format adherence and rudimentary code generation (in one case), it fundamentally fails to understand the task, recognize relevant patterns, and apply correct transformations. Its current performance is essentially random.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Format Adherence:** Consistently returns answers in the requested format (JSON or Markdown JSON). This is a minor positive that makes debugging easier.\n*   **Basic Code Generation (when prompted):** The system *can* generate syntactically correct code. However, it does so inappropriately in cases where a grid output is expected, and even when code is appropriate, it doesn't solve the correct task.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The core weakness is the inability to identify and apply transformation patterns. This directly causes the failure to generate correct outputs.\n*   **Logical Reasoning:** The system fails to perform any meaningful logical inference based on the training examples. This leads to random or nonsensical transformations.\n*   **Abstraction:**  Incorrectly determines whether code generation is necessary or if a direct grid transformation should be output. This displays a misinterpretation of the task requirements.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system does not include any ability to determine if the solutions that it has provided are correct.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **Pattern Recognition**. Without accurate pattern recognition, the system cannot hope to solve the grid transformation problems. Improving this will cascade into improvements in logical reasoning and overall accuracy.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Focus on Data Augmentation with Curriculum Learning:**\n    *   Start with a much simpler set of training examples. Begin with transformations that involve single, easily identifiable patterns (e.g., simple rotations, reflections, color swaps).\n    *   Progressively increase the complexity of the training data, gradually introducing more complex patterns and combinations of transformations. This allows the model to learn simpler patterns first and then build on that knowledge.\n\n2.  **Implement a Pattern Matching Module:**\n    *   Instead of relying solely on the language model, explicitly incorporate computer vision techniques.\n    *   Develop a module that identifies repeating patterns, shapes, and arrangements within the grid.\n    *   This module should output a set of candidate transformation rules.\n\n3.  **Introduce a Logic Engine/Constraint Solver:**\n    *   After identifying candidate transformation rules, use a logic engine or constraint solver to evaluate their applicability.\n    *   This engine should enforce constraints based on the training examples.\n    *   For example, if a rotation is observed in the training examples, the logic engine should verify that the rotation is consistently applied in the test input.\n\n4.  **Enforce Output Type Constraints:**\n    *   Implement a validation step before returning the output.  If the task requires a grid, ensure the output is a grid. If the task requires code, ensure code is generated.\n    *   Raise an exception if the output type is incorrect. This helps constrain the model and focus its efforts on generating the correct *type* of solution.\n\n5.  **Add Solution Verification Module:**\n    *   Implement a module that can check if the model's transformations are correct. If the provided solution is incorrect, the model should attempt to resolve it again.\n    *   This can involve checking symmetry, or comparing cells from the input to the output grid.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data (0% accuracy, consistent errors), the capability trend is **stable at a very low level**. There is no evidence of improvement and significant changes are required to move the system towards a functional state.\n",

This is a peculiar state. This likely means one of the following:\n\n1.  **The system didn't process any samples in Iteration 20.** This could be due to a configuration error, a pause in the execution pipeline, or an unexpected interruption.\n2.  **The system processed samples, but the evaluation/logging mechanism failed.** The system *might* have executed samples correctly or incorrectly, but the results weren't properly recorded in the `correct_samples` or `incorrect_samples` arrays.\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\nIt is impossible to provide actionable insights without any actual execution data. The most important immediate step is to identify WHY there are no correct OR incorrect samples.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **INVESTIGATE THE EXECUTION PIPELINE:** The very first thing to determine is *why* the system is not logging any results (correct or incorrect).  Here are concrete investigation steps:\n\n    *   **Check Logging:** Verify that the logging mechanisms are functioning correctly. Are there any errors in the logging system itself? Are logs being written to the correct location?  Increase logging verbosity temporarily.\n    *   **Check Input Data:** Was the system provided with any input data for iteration 20? If not, that's the reason for no results. Verify the input data pipeline.\n    *   **Check Execution State:** Was the execution pipeline actually running during the time frame of iteration 20? Are there any error messages or exceptions raised during that period?\n    *   **Examine evaluation logic:** Review the code responsible for determining `correct_count` and `incorrect_count`. Is there a bug preventing these counts from being updated?\n\n2.  **ONCE EXECUTION DATA IS AVAILABLE, REPEAT THE ANALYSIS:** Once the logging issue is resolved and there are *actual* `correct_samples` and `incorrect_samples`, then the following types of analysis can be performed:\n\n    *   **Prompt Analysis (Successful vs. Failed):**\n        *   *Successful Prompts:* Look for keywords, phrasing, or structural elements that appear consistently in successful prompts. Quote specific parts of the prompt. Example: \"Prompts that started with `Summarize the following document concisely:` consistently led to correct summaries.\"\n        *   *Failed Prompts:* Identify patterns in prompts that led to failures.

    "insights": "Okay, let's analyze the execution traces from iteration 20.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nBased on the provided data:\n\n*   `iteration`: 20\n*   `correct_count`: 0\n*   `incorrect_count`: 0\n*   `correct_samples`: `[]`\n*   `incorrect_samples`: `[]`\n\nThis indicates that in iteration 20, there were **no correct executions** and **no incorrect executions recorded either**. This is a peculiar state. This likely means one of the following:\n\n1.  **The system didn't process any samples in Iteration 20.** This could be due to a configuration error, a pause in the execution pipeline, or an unexpected interruption.\n2.  **The system processed samples, but the evaluation/logging mechanism failed.** The system *might* have executed samples correctly or incorrectly, but the results weren't properly recorded in the `correct_samples` or `incorrect_samples` arrays.\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\nIt is impossible to provide actionable insights without any actual execution data. The most important immediate step is to identify WHY there are no correct OR incorrect samples.\n\n**Actionable Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **INVESTIGATE THE EXECUTION PIPELINE:** The very first thing to determine is *why* the system is not logging any results (correct or incorrect).  Here are concrete investigation steps:\n\n    *   **Check Logging:** Verify that the logging mechanisms are functioning correctly. Are there any errors in the logging system itself? Are logs being written to the correct location?  Increase logging verbosity temporarily.\n    *   **Check Input Data:** Was the system provided with any input data for iteration 20? If not, that's the reason for no results. Verify the input data pipeline.\n    *   **Check Execution State:** Was the execution pipeline actually running during the time frame of iteration 20? Are there any error messages or exceptions raised during that period?\n    *   **Examine evaluation logic:** Review the code responsible for determining `correct_count` and `incorrect_count`. Is there a bug preventing these counts from being updated?\n\n2.  **ONCE EXECUTION DATA IS AVAILABLE, REPEAT THE ANALYSIS:** Once the logging issue is resolved and there are *actual* `correct_samples` and `incorrect_samples`, then the following types of analysis can be performed:\n\n    *   **Prompt Analysis (Successful vs. Failed):**\n        *   *Successful Prompts:* Look for keywords, phrasing, or structural elements that appear consistently in successful prompts.

Using the training examples to GENERATE multiple potential hypotheses about the transformation rule. Previous systems primarily used rules that were derived from prompt engineering or direct information extraction. This approach will derive the rule by explicitly asking for multiple possibilities.\n2.  TESTING these hypotheses systematically against the examples.\n3.  Choosing the hypothesis that best fits ALL examples.\n4.  Applying the selected and tested hypotheses to the test input to generate the transformed grid.\n\nThis approach is designed to improve robustness and generalization by explicitly exploring and validating different potential rules, rather than relying on a single, potentially flawed, initial extraction.

  "approach_summary": "The script addresses grid transformation problems by generating and validating multiple hypotheses using the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into hypothesis generation, testing, and application, assigning the LLM the roles of an expert in analyzing grid transformations and applying rules. The `generate_hypotheses` function creates multiple potential transformation rules, `test_hypotheses` verifies them against training data, and `apply_transformation` applies the best validated rule to the test input. The `call_llm` function is used by each function to send requests to the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves generating hypotheses, testing them, selecting the best one, extracting the test input, and applying the transformation to generate the final output.",

Unable to generate a useful output.\" in several cases indicating a failure to find a valid solution. This is not a runtime error per se, but a higher-level indication of reasoning failure.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code generation**: The system can generate basic Python code based on the problem description. This is observed in sample 1 and 4.\n*   **Pattern recognition:** The system correctly identifies patterns within the input grids in some cases, as shown in sample 3 where it partially replicates the original matrix.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Hypothesis Validation**: The system frequently fails to validate a hypothesis, leading to a default error output. This suggests a problem in either the hypothesis generation or the validation stage.\n*   **Inability to Generalize**: The system struggles to generalize from the training examples to the test input, often leading to incorrect transformations or the inability to find a transformation at all.\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Logic**: Even when the system attempts to apply a transformation, it often uses incorrect logic, such as flipping the grid when a more complex pattern is required.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Hypothesis Validation Failure:** The inability to validate a learned hypothesis against the provided training examples. This likely indicates that the system is unable to appropriately evaluate the generated transformations for accuracy.\n*   **Inferring Transformation Rules**: The core challenge is the inability to correctly infer and apply complex transformation rules based on the training examples. The current approach seems to rely on very basic transformations, which are insufficient for many of the problems.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Default Error Response**: When the system cannot determine the transformation rule, it defaults to an error message, suggesting a lack of fallback strategies or exploration of alternative hypotheses.\n*   **Incorrect Flipping Transformation**: The system frequently attempts to solve the grid problems by flipping the input, as seen in examples 1 and 4. This simplistic approach doesn't align with the golden answers. This implies either that the model is being biased or has a default rule in place before trying other rules.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **failure to correctly infer and apply the intended transformation rule from the training examples to the test input.** This stems from inadequate hypothesis generation and validation and a reliance on simple, incorrect transformations like flipping.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation**: The system needs a more sophisticated method for generating hypotheses about the transformation rule. This could involve exploring a wider range of possible transformations (e.g., shifting, rotating, filling patterns, conditional replacements) and incorporating spatial reasoning.\n*   **Hypothesis Validation**: The validation process needs to be improved to accurately evaluate whether a generated hypothesis is consistent with the training examples. This could involve quantitative measures of similarity between transformed training inputs and their corresponding outputs.\n*   **Rule Representation**: The system needs a more robust representation of transformation rules, allowing it to express more complex operations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement a more robust rule generation process**. Explore transformations beyond simple flips, such as row/column operations, conditional replacements, or pattern recognition based on neighboring cell values.\n*   **Introduce a scoring mechanism for hypothesis validation**. Quantify the similarity between the transformed training inputs and the training outputs. This will help the system choose the best hypothesis from the set of possible transformations.\n*   **Increase the complexity of the model's rule set**. Allow the model to generate more complex rules for transformation, going beyond simple flips and potentially incorporate the 3 as the magic number.\n*   **Introduce a fallback mechanism**.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your request for a thorough and actionable assessment.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/5)\n*   Error samples: 5/5\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal significant problems:\n\n*   **Frequent \"No Hypothesis\" Errors:** The system frequently defaults to \"Error: No hypothesis could be validated from the set. Unable to generate a useful output.\" This is the dominant failure mode, indicating a fundamental flaw in hypothesis generation and validation. This suggests the system is struggling to find *any* transformation that fits the training data.\n\n*   **Incorrect Code Generation (when present):** When code *is* generated (e.g., Sample 1), it often implements a simple, incorrect transformation (e.g., flipping the grid).  The code is syntactically correct Python, but logically wrong for the problem. This points to issues with both *understanding* the desired transformation and *translating* that understanding into correct code.\n\n*   **Lack of Fallback:** There doesn't appear to be a fallback mechanism. When the system fails to identify a \"good\" transformation, it gives up rather than trying a simpler or more generic approach.\n\n*   **Partial Success (Sample 3):** Sample ID 3 shows partial replication of the input matrix, this might indicate that the system has some understanding of the task but fails to generalize.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe AI system, as currently implemented, demonstrates very limited capability in solving the target grid transformation problems. Its core abilities to extract patterns, generate valid transformations, and validate these transformations are severely deficient. The system is essentially failing to solve the problem and provides either a default failure output or incorrect results based on overly simplistic transformations.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Basic Code Generation:** The system can generate syntactically correct Python code, even if the logic is flawed. This foundation can be leveraged as the system improves its understanding of the transformation rules.\n*   **Partial Pattern Recognition:** The partial success with Sample 3 indicates some capacity for pattern recognition but not enough to fully extract and apply the correct transformation.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation Failure:** The system's inability to generate a diverse set of plausible transformation hypotheses is a major bottleneck. It needs a much broader range of possible operations to consider.\n*   **Hypothesis Validation Inadequacy:** The validation process is unable to reliably distinguish correct from incorrect hypotheses. It's either too strict (rejecting valid options) or too lenient (accepting flawed ones).\n*   **Transformation Rule Inferencing:** The system struggles to extrapolate transformation rules from training data to test data effectively.  It tends to overfit to simple rules (e.g., flipping).\n*   **Lack of Error Handling/Fallback:** The absence of a robust error-handling strategy or fallback mechanism leads to frequent failures and a lack of exploration for alternative solutions.\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Logic:** The system attempts transformations, such as flipping, which do not align with the problem requirements.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Hypothesis Generation**.  Without a strong hypothesis generation process, the subsequent validation and application stages are doomed to fail.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Expand Hypothesis Generation:**\n    *   **Introduce a wider range of transformation operations:**  Beyond flipping, include operations like rotations (90, 180, 270 degrees), shifts (row/column-wise), filling patterns based on neighboring cells, conditional cell replacements, and more complex mathematical functions.\n    *   **Implement a symbolic reasoning component:** Incorporate a module that can reason symbolically about the relationships between the input and output grids (e.g., \"the top row of the input becomes the bottom row of the output\"). This would allow the system to generate hypotheses based on more abstract concepts.\n    *   **Explore search strategies:** Implement a search algorithm (e.g., breadth-first, depth-first, A*) to systematically explore the space of possible transformations.\n\n2.  **Enhance Hypothesis Validation:**\n    *   **Implement a scoring function:** Quantify the \"goodness\" of a hypothesis based on how well the transformed training inputs match the training outputs. Use metrics like pixel-wise similarity, structural similarity, or even learned similarity metrics.\n    *   **Introduce negative examples:**  Provide the validator with examples of *incorrect* transformations to help it learn to reject bad hypotheses.\n    *   **Incorporate a threshold:** Only accept hypotheses that exceed a certain threshold of \"goodness.\"\n\n3.  **Implement a Fallback Mechanism:**\n    *   **Hierarchical Transformation Application:**  Start by attempting more complex transformations. If they fail, fall back to simpler transformations or default rules (e.g., copying the input grid).\n    *   **Exploration of Alternative Hypotheses:** If the system fails to validate a hypothesis, it should explore alternative hypotheses instead of immediately returning an error.\n\n4.  **Refine the Code Generation Process:**\n    *   **Parameterize the transformation functions:** Instead of hardcoding specific transformations like flipping, generate code that can perform a wider range of parameterized operations.\n    *   **Introduce a code template library:** Store code snippets for common transformation operations (e.g., rotating a matrix) in a library, and use these snippets to generate the final transformation code.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the provided information, the capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level** (near zero). There is no evidence of improvement. The system consistently fails, indicating a lack of progress in learning and generalization.\n\nBy focusing on the key weaknesses (hypothesis generation and validation) and implementing the actionable recommendations, there is significant potential to improve the system's capabilities in future iterations.\n",

Instead of immediately returning an error, the system should explore alternative hypotheses or apply simpler transformations if a complex rule cannot be determined.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0**:\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to extract relevant patterns from the training examples.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid solution.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Unable to validate any generated hypothesis.\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed to make an effective decision.\n*   **Sample ID 1**:\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to extract relevant patterns from the training examples.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated incorrect transformation logic.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Incorrect validation of the transformation.\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed to make an effective decision.\n*   **Sample ID 2**:\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to extract relevant patterns from the training examples.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid solution.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Unable to validate any generated hypothesis.\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed to make an effective decision.\n*   **Sample ID 3**:\n    *   solution\\_generation: Partially generated correct results but failed to transform the whole output matrix\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed to completely validate the generated hypothesis.\n    *   decision\\_making: Incomplete decision.\n*   **Sample ID 4**:\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to extract relevant patterns from the training examples.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated incorrect transformation logic (flipping).\n    *   solution\\_verification: Incorrect validation of the flipping transformation.\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed to make an effective decision.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your request for a thorough and actionable assessment.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/5)\n*   Error samples: 5/5\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal significant problems:\n\n*   **Frequent \"No Hypothesis\" Errors:** The system frequently defaults to \"Error: No hypothesis could be validated from the set. Unable to generate a useful output.\" This is the dominant failure mode, indicating a fundamental flaw in hypothesis generation and validation. This suggests the system is struggling to find *any* transformation that fits the training data.\n\n*   **Incorrect Code Generation (when present):** When code *is* generated (e.g., Sample 1), it often implements a simple, incorrect transformation (e.g., flipping the grid).  The code is syntactically correct Python, but logically wrong for the problem. This points to issues with both *understanding* the desired transformation and *translating* that understanding into correct code.\n\n*   **Lack of Fallback:** There doesn't appear to be a fallback mechanism. When the system fails to identify a \"good\" transformation, it gives up rather than trying a simpler or more generic approach.\n\n*   **Partial Success (Sample 3):** Sample ID 3 shows partial replication of the input matrix, this might indicate that the system has some understanding of the task but fails to generalize.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe AI system, as currently implemented, demonstrates very limited capability in solving the target grid transformation problems. Its core abilities to extract patterns, generate valid transformations, and validate these transformations are severely deficient. The system is essentially failing to solve the problem and provides either a default failure output or incorrect results based on overly simplistic transformations.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Basic Code Generation:** The system can generate syntactically correct Python code, even if the logic is flawed. This foundation can be leveraged as the system improves its understanding of the transformation rules.\n*   **Partial Pattern Recognition:** The partial success with Sample 3 indicates some capacity for pattern recognition but not enough to fully extract and apply the correct transformation.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation Failure:** The system's inability to generate a diverse set of plausible transformation hypotheses is a major bottleneck. It needs a much broader range of possible operations to consider.\n*   **Hypothesis Validation Inadequacy:** The validation process is unable to reliably distinguish correct from incorrect hypotheses. It's either too strict (rejecting valid options) or too lenient (accepting flawed ones).\n*   **Transformation Rule Inferencing:** The system struggles to extrapolate transformation rules from training data to test data effectively.  It tends to overfit to simple rules (e.g., flipping).\n*   **Lack of Error Handling/Fallback:** The absence of a robust error-handling strategy or fallback mechanism leads to frequent failures and a lack of exploration for alternative solutions.\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Logic:** The system attempts transformations, such as flipping, which do not align with the problem requirements.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Hypothesis Generation**.  Without a strong hypothesis generation process, the subsequent validation and application stages are doomed to fail.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Expand Hypothesis Generation:**\n    *   **Introduce a wider range of transformation operations:**  Beyond flipping, include operations like rotations (90, 180, 270 degrees), shifts (row/column-wise), filling patterns based on neighboring cells, conditional cell replacements, and more complex mathematical functions.\n    *   **Implement a symbolic reasoning component:** Incorporate a module that can reason symbolically about the relationships between the input and output grids (e.g., \"the top row of the input becomes the bottom row of the output\"). This would allow the system to generate hypotheses based on more abstract concepts.\n    *   **Explore search strategies:** Implement a search algorithm (e.g., breadth-first, depth-first, A*) to systematically explore the space of possible transformations.\n\n2.  **Enhance Hypothesis Validation:**\n    *   **Implement a scoring function:** Quantify the \"goodness\" of a hypothesis based on how well the transformed training inputs match the training outputs. Use metrics like pixel-wise similarity, structural similarity, or even learned similarity metrics.\n    *   **Introduce negative examples:**  Provide the validator with examples of *incorrect* transformations to help it learn to reject bad hypotheses.\n    *   **Incorporate a threshold:** Only accept hypotheses that exceed a certain threshold of \"goodness.\"\n\n3.  **Implement a Fallback Mechanism:**\n    *   **Hierarchical Transformation Application:**  Start by attempting more complex transformations. If they fail, fall back to simpler transformations or default rules (e.g., copying the input grid).\n    *   **Exploration of Alternative Hypotheses:** If the system fails to validate a hypothesis, it should explore alternative hypotheses instead of immediately returning an error.\n\n4.  **Refine the Code Generation Process:**\n    *   **Parameterize the transformation functions:** Instead of hardcoding specific transformations like flipping, generate code that can perform a wider range of parameterized operations.\n    *   **Introduce a code template library:** Store code snippets for common transformation operations (e.g., rotating a matrix) in a library, and use these snippets to generate the final transformation code.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the provided information, the capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level** (near zero). There is no evidence of improvement. The system consistently fails, indicating a lack of progress in learning and generalization.\n\nBy focusing on the key weaknesses (hypothesis generation and validation) and implementing the actionable recommendations, there is significant potential to improve the system's capabilities in future iterations.\n"

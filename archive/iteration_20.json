  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings using an LLM-driven approach with specialized agents for extraction and scheduling, employing multi-example prompting and explicit validation steps. The `extract_meeting_info` function extracts meeting details and validates them, retrying if necessary, while the `schedule_meeting` function proposes a meeting time and validates that it satisfies all constraints; `call_llm` calls the Gemini LLM, and the `main` function orchestrates the process. The workflow involves extracting information, scheduling the meeting, and validating the extraction and scheduling; `extract_meeting_info` is first called by main; then validated using the LLM and if extraction is valid, `schedule_meeting` is called by main with the extracted info and is validated; if scheduling is valid, the proposed time is returned by `schedule_meeting`.",

  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM (Gemini Pro) to answer a question through a multi-step process, mimicking chain-of-thought reasoning. The problem is decomposed into clarification, reasoning plan generation, and execution. There are no explicit agent roles, but the LLM implicitly takes on the roles of question clarifier, planner, and answer generator. The function `call_llm` sends prompts to the LLM and returns the response, handling safety settings and potential errors, and the `main` function orchestrates the entire process by calling `call_llm` three times with different prompts designed to clarify the question, create a reasoning plan, and execute that plan to generate an answer.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error across all error cases is \"Error calling LLM: HARASSMENT\". This indicates that the Large Language Model (LLM) being used to generate solutions is flagging the problem description or the attempted reasoning process as potentially violating its safety guidelines related to harassment. This is not a technical error in the code, but a filtering mechanism within the LLM itself, which is triggered when the input is perceived as inappropriate. This error prevents the system from generating any useful output or attempting to solve the problem.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nSince all provided cases resulted in a \"HARASSMENT\" error, it's impossible to identify specific strengths of the problem-solving approach based on this data alone. The system's inability to proceed past the LLM safety filter obscures any potential strengths in its reasoning or implementation.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1. **Oversensitivity to Harassment Filters:** The LLM appears overly sensitive to the input provided, incorrectly flagging grid transformation tasks as potentially harassing. This severely hinders the system's ability to solve even seemingly harmless problems.\n2. **Lack of Error Handling for Harassment Flags:** The system doesn't have a robust mechanism to handle \"HARASSMENT\" errors from the LLM. Instead of attempting to rephrase the input, adjust the problem-solving approach, or providing a more informative error message, the system simply halts and returns the \"HARASSMENT\" error.\n3. **Opacity of Triggering Factors:**  It's unclear why the grid transformation tasks are being flagged as potentially harassing. This makes it difficult to proactively avoid triggering the safety filter.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1. **LLM Harassment Filter:** The primary bottleneck is the LLM's harassment filter, which is inappropriately triggered by the grid transformation tasks, preventing the system from engaging in any problem-solving.\n2. **Insufficient Error Handling:** The lack of error handling around the harassment filter means that the system cannot recover gracefully when this error occurs.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent \"HARASSMENT\" error across all error cases indicates a systematic issue, rather than isolated incidents. It suggests the LLM has a bias or misunderstanding regarding this specific type of grid transformation problem, or that the way the problem is presented to the LLM is somehow triggering the safety filter.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **incorrect triggering of the LLM's harassment filter** by grid transformation tasks. This prevents the system from functioning as intended and needs to be addressed to enable any meaningful problem-solving.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1. **Investigate LLM Sensitivity:** Investigate the specific triggers causing the LLM to flag grid transformation tasks as potentially harassing. This involves understanding the LLM's safety guidelines and identifying aspects of the input that might be misinterpreted.\n2. **Implement Error Handling and Retries:** Implement more robust error handling for \"HARASSMENT\" errors. This could involve:\n    *   Rephrasing the input to the LLM.\n    *   Adjusting the problem-solving strategy to avoid potentially problematic language.\n    *   Providing a more informative error message to the user.\n    *   Implementing a retry mechanism with modified parameters.\n3. **Explore Alternative LLMs or Fine-tuning:** If the issue persists, consider using a different LLM or fine-tuning the current LLM to be less sensitive to the specific characteristics of grid transformation tasks.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Input Sanitization:** Before passing the problem description to the LLM, sanitize the input by removing any potentially ambiguous or triggering words/phrases. Experiment to determine which specific elements are causing the filter to trigger.\n2. **Prompt Engineering:** Modify the prompt used to interact with the LLM. Instead of asking the LLM to \"transform\" the grid, rephrase it in a more neutral way, such as \"analyze and apply patterns to the grid\".\n3. **Rate Limiting and Fallback:** If the LLM continues to flag the input, implement rate limiting to prevent excessive requests and potentially trigger the filter again. Consider having a fallback mechanism to use a simpler, rule-based approach for solving grid transformation tasks in cases where the LLM consistently fails.\n4. **Detailed Logging:** Add detailed logging to track the exact input sent to the LLM, the response received, and any intermediate steps taken by the system. This will help diagnose the root cause of the harassment filter trigger and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** All capabilities failed due to the \"HARASSMENT\" error.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** All capabilities failed due to the \"HARASSMENT\" error.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** All capabilities failed due to the \"HARASSMENT\" error.\n*   **Sample ID 3:** All capabilities failed due to the \"HARASSMENT\" error.\n*   **Sample ID 4:** All capabilities failed due to the \"HARASSMENT\" error.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your requirements.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs are extremely consistent and negative.  Every sample resulted in the same \"Error calling LLM: HARASSMENT\" message. This strongly suggests that the problem lies not with the *specific* inputs of each sample, but with a *general* characteristic of how the AI system is approaching (or phrasing) the grid transformation tasks when interacting with the LLM.  The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags indicate the system *attempted* to provide an answer, but the LLM immediately halted the process. This immediate rejection eliminates any possibility of nuanced analysis of different solutions. The uniformity in the error message across all samples strongly indicates a systematic issue rather than random LLM misinterpretations. The fact that no partial solutions or attempts at reasoning are produced further underscores the severity of the problem.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has *zero* demonstrated capability in solving grid transformation tasks.  The consistently triggered harassment filter completely prevents any problem-solving. The system's ability to even *attempt* the task is overshadowed by the inability to interact meaningfully with the LLM.  The current performance is unacceptable and requires immediate attention. The lack of variability in the error prevents meaningful assessment of strengths or weaknesses in underlying algorithms.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the provided data, it's impossible to identify any demonstrable strengths in the system's problem-solving capabilities.  The only potential \"strength\" might be that the system correctly identifies and reports the LLM error, rather than crashing or producing nonsensical output.  This is a very weak positive, however, and should not be overemphasized.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Susceptibility to LLM Safety Filter:**  The system is completely blocked by the LLM's harassment filter, rendering it useless for the target tasks. This is the dominant and most critical weakness.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling/Recovery:** The system's response to the \"HARASSMENT\" error is inadequate. There is no attempt to rephrase the input, adjust the reasoning strategy, or provide more helpful information to the user.\n3.  **Lack of Insight into LLM Behavior:** The system provides no mechanism to understand *why* the LLM is triggering the filter.  This makes debugging and mitigation extremely difficult.  The error message is too generic.\n4.  **Inability to Fallback:** The system does not have an alternative approach for solving grid transformation tasks when the LLM fails.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **mitigating the LLM harassment filter trigger.**  Until this issue is resolved, the system cannot function at all. All other potential improvements are irrelevant until this critical bottleneck is addressed.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Immediate Input Analysis and Sanitization:**  Focus on pinpointing the exact input components that trigger the \"HARASSMENT\" error.\n    *   Create a minimal test case. Start with an extremely simple grid transformation problem and gradually add complexity, testing after each addition, until the error occurs.  This will isolate the triggering elements.\n    *   Experiment with different phrasings of the problem description, removing potentially ambiguous or loaded words.  Pay close attention to words like \"transform,\" \"change,\" \"modify,\" etc.\n    *   Log the exact input being sent to the LLM for each test case.\n\n2.  **Prompt Engineering Experimentation:** Modify the prompts used to interact with the LLM.\n    *   Test different prompt structures. Instead of asking the LLM to directly \"solve\" the problem, try asking it to \"analyze,\" \"describe patterns,\" or \"generate possible steps.\"\n    *   Use more technical and less descriptive language.  Avoid words that might be interpreted as relating to harmful actions.\n    *   Explore prompts that emphasize the mathematical or logical nature of the grid transformation problem, rather than its visual appearance.\n\n3.  **Implement Basic Error Handling with Input Modification:** Add basic error handling. If a \"HARASSMENT\" error occurs:\n    *   Attempt to rephrase the input using a predefined set of alternative phrases.\n    *   Remove any potentially problematic keywords.\n    *   Retry the request with the modified input a limited number of times.\n\n4.  **Investigate LLM Configuration and Fine-tuning (If Possible):**\n    *   If possible, examine the LLM's configuration settings related to safety and sensitivity.\n    *   If fine-tuning is an option, consider fine-tuning the LLM on a dataset of grid transformation tasks that are known *not* to trigger the filter.\n\n5.  **Implement a Hardcoded Bypass (Temporary):**\n    *  As a stopgap measure to enable further testing, create a simple rule-based system capable of solving a small subset of extremely basic grid transformation problems (e.g., inverting colors, simple rotations).  This bypasses the LLM and allows for evaluation of other parts of the system.  This is *not* a long-term solution, but will allow progress to be made while the LLM issue is investigated.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **negative and critical.** The system is completely non-functional for the intended task. Urgent action is required to reverse this trend.\n",

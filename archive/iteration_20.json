  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with verification to answer questions. The problem is decomposed into sub-questions, followed by information extraction and answer synthesis, each with a validation step. The agent takes on roles of question decomposer, information extraction expert, and answer synthesis expert. Key functions are `main` (overall workflow), `decompose_question` (breaks down the question), `extract_information` (finds relevant data), `synthesize_answer` (creates the final answer), and `call_llm` (interacts with the LLM). The overall workflow involves decomposing the question, extracting information, synthesizing the answer, and verifying each step for validity and correctness using the LLM.",

The Patriots answered with quarterback Tom Brady completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Deion Branch, yet Pittsburgh struck back with Roethlisberger connecting with wide receiver Antonio Brown on a 7-yard touchdown pass.  New England would close out the half with kicker Stephen Gostkowski got a 46-yard field goal. The Steelers began the third quarter with a 21-yard field goal from Suisham, followed by his 23-yard field goal in the fourth.  The Patriots tried to rally as Brady completed a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Aaron Hernandez, yet Pittsburgh's defense held with safety Troy Polamalu forcing a New England fumble out of the back of the end zone for a safety. With the win, the Steelers improved to 6-2 and also won their first game against the Patriots since 2008 and first game against the Patriots with Tom Brady as the starter since 2004.",

From 2000 Greece saw high levels of GDP growth above the Eurozone average, peaking at 5.8% in 2003 and 5.7% in 2006. The subsequent Great Recession and Greek government-debt crisis, a central focus of the wider European debt crisis, plunged the economy into a sharp downturn, with Real gross domestic product GDP growth rates of \u22120.3% in 2008, \u22124.3% in 2009, \u22125.5% in 2010, \u22129.1% in 2011, \u22127.3% in 2012 and \u22123.2% in 2013. In 2011, the countrys government debt reached \u20ac356 billion (172% of nominal GDP). After negotiating the biggest debt restructuring in history with the private sector involvement, Greece reduced its sovereign debt burden to \u20ac280 billion (137% of GDP) in the first quarter of 2012. Greece achieved a real GDP growth rate of 0.7% in 2014\u2014after 6 years of economic decline\u2014but contracted by 0.3% in 2015 and by 0.2% in 2016.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and my expertise as a System Capability Analyst.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a few crucial points:\n\n*   **Hallucination-Free (So Far):** All generated outputs can be traced back to the context passage, which shows that it is hallucination free.\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system seems capable of extracting specific pieces of information, even if it sometimes includes extraneous details (as highlighted in the overall error analysis). Sample ID 0, although classified as an error, still managed to extract the correct racial population figures.\n*   **Answer Formatting:** The system correctly uses the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags, indicating proper output structuring.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning (Present but Untested):** The fact that numerical reasoning is identified as a strength in the Error Analysis report, but that is not reflected in the `SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS`.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a moderate level of capability in understanding and answering questions based on provided text. It excels at identifying and extracting relevant information but struggles with *precision* and *filtering* that information to meet specific question constraints. The core understanding of the text is there, but the system requires refinement to be considered truly reliable.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:**  The system can successfully identify and extract key pieces of information from the provided context.\n*   **Reasoning Capabilities:** The system demonstrates reasoning capabilities, which, though not explicitly demonstrated in the `SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS`, are still present in the Error Analysis report.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Over-Generalization/Lack of Precision:**  The most significant weakness is the tendency to include extra, unnecessary information, even if the core answer is factually correct. This indicates a failure to understand and adhere to the implicit constraints of the question.\n*   **Lack of Fine-Grained Filtering:** The system has difficulty filtering out irrelevant information, even when it can identify the relevant information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **constraint handling**, specifically the ability to provide only the *most relevant* information to answer the question, and to avoid including extraneous details. This directly addresses the primary issue of over-generalization.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis, here are specific actions to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Enhanced Prompting (Refine Prompting Strategy):**\n    *   **Specificity Emphasis:** Revise the prompt to explicitly instruct the model to focus on providing only the *most specific* and *directly relevant* information.  Use phrases like:\n        *   \"Answer the question *precisely* using the provided passage.\"\n        *   \"Include *only* the information that is *explicitly requested* in the question.\"\n        *   \"Do not include any information that is not *directly required* to answer the question.\"\n\n2.  **Post-Processing Filter (Implement a Post-Processing Filter):**\n    *   **Question-Answer Similarity:** Implement a post-processing step that assesses the similarity between the question and each component of the answer. This can be achieved by:\n        *   Using cosine similarity or other semantic similarity measures between the question and segments of the answer.\n        *   Removing answer segments with low similarity scores, indicating they are not directly responsive to the question.\n        *   Breaking the answers into sentences or phrases.\n        *   Assign a score to each based on its relevance.\n        *   Filter any low scores.\n    *   **Information Retrieval:** Use information retrieval techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, BM25) to rank the importance of different parts of the answer based on the question. Remove low-ranking parts.\n\n3.  **Training Data Augmentation (Implement Negative Examples):**\n    *   **Focus on Over-Generalization:** Create new training examples specifically designed to address the over-generalization issue. These examples should:\n        *   Include passages and questions where providing extra information leads to an incorrect answer.\n        *   Emphasize the importance of only including the *most relevant* details.\n        *   Use similar domain data.\n\n4.  **Introduce Solution Validation Layer:**\n    *   **Evaluation Rubric:** Create an explicit rubric or set of criteria for validating the generated answers. This rubric should penalize answers that:\n        *   Include information not directly asked for in the question.\n        *   Provide a longer or more complex answer than necessary.\n        *   Include context.\n\n5.  **Expand Sample Set:**\n    *   **Include Numerical Reasoning Test Cases:** Add sample execution outputs that specifically test the system's numerical reasoning capabilities. This will allow for better monitoring and analysis of that aspect of its performance.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is currently **stable but with significant potential for improvement**. The system demonstrates a foundation of understanding and information extraction, but the lack of precision limits its overall effectiveness. Implementing the recommendations above should lead to a clear upward trend in performance.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no runtime errors in the provided error or success cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Numerical Reasoning:** The system correctly performs numerical reasoning and calculations as demonstrated in success cases like sample\\_id 3 (calculating total points scored) and sample\\_id 4(counting touchdowns).\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system is capable of extracting relevant information from the passage to answer questions effectively. This is evident in the success cases.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Over-Generalization:** The system includes additional information in its answers that are not strictly required by the question, leading to incorrect responses. This is demonstrated by sample_id 0.\n*   **Incomplete Information Filtering:** The system is not effectively filtering out extraneous or less relevant information from the passage when answering questions.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inability to focus on the 'most relevant' information:** The system struggles to precisely identify the *most* relevant piece of information necessary to answer the question, often including additional correct but unnecessary details, thus providing an incorrect answer as it includes irrelevant information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Inclusion of extra information:** The primary error pattern is the inclusion of accurate but irrelevant details in the answer, causing a mismatch with the golden answer.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the system's tendency to include extra information that, while true, is not explicitly required by the question. This leads to the system including details that should be excluded, even if the core answer is correct. Specifically the AI includes White American when the question only asks for groups that made over 30% of the population, when it was looking for the highest percentage.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system needs improvement in applying constraints correctly, particularly when the question asks for *specific* information and not *all* related information.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system's solution verification process should be refined to penalize answers that include extra, unnecessary details.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Refine Prompting Strategy:** Modify the prompt to explicitly instruct the system to provide only the *most specific* and *directly relevant* information needed to answer the question. Add phrases like \"Answer the question *directly* using the passage\" and \"Only include what is *specifically asked for*\".\n*   **Post-Processing Filter:** Implement a post-processing step that filters out any extra information from the answer. This could involve comparing the system's answer to the question and removing any parts that are not directly responsive to the question's core requirement. Use similarity scores and information retrieval techniques to determine if a part of the answer is truly necessary.\n*   **Implement Negative Examples:** Add negative examples to the training data that demonstrate instances where including extra information leads to an incorrect answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Successful in extracting relevant racial population data.\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed to adhere to the constraint of listing *only* the racial groups that individually constitute more than 30% of the population.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed to verify that the answer contained only the *most relevant* information.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and my expertise as a System Capability Analyst.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a few crucial points:\n\n*   **Hallucination-Free (So Far):** All generated outputs can be traced back to the context passage, which shows that it is hallucination free.\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system seems capable of extracting specific pieces of information, even if it sometimes includes extraneous details (as highlighted in the overall error analysis). Sample ID 0, although classified as an error, still managed to extract the correct racial population figures.\n*   **Answer Formatting:** The system correctly uses the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags, indicating proper output structuring.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning (Present but Untested):** The fact that numerical reasoning is identified as a strength in the Error Analysis report, but that is not reflected in the `SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS`.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a moderate level of capability in understanding and answering questions based on provided text. It excels at identifying and extracting relevant information but struggles with *precision* and *filtering* that information to meet specific question constraints. The core understanding of the text is there, but the system requires refinement to be considered truly reliable.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:**  The system can successfully identify and extract key pieces of information from the provided context.\n*   **Reasoning Capabilities:** The system demonstrates reasoning capabilities, which, though not explicitly demonstrated in the `SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS`, are still present in the Error Analysis report.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Over-Generalization/Lack of Precision:**  The most significant weakness is the tendency to include extra, unnecessary information, even if the core answer is factually correct. This indicates a failure to understand and adhere to the implicit constraints of the question.\n*   **Lack of Fine-Grained Filtering:** The system has difficulty filtering out irrelevant information, even when it can identify the relevant information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **constraint handling**, specifically the ability to provide only the *most relevant* information to answer the question, and to avoid including extraneous details. This directly addresses the primary issue of over-generalization.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis, here are specific actions to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Enhanced Prompting (Refine Prompting Strategy):**\n    *   **Specificity Emphasis:** Revise the prompt to explicitly instruct the model to focus on providing only the *most specific* and *directly relevant* information.  Use phrases like:\n        *   \"Answer the question *precisely* using the provided passage.\"\n        *   \"Include *only* the information that is *explicitly requested* in the question.\"\n        *   \"Do not include any information that is not *directly required* to answer the question.\"\n\n2.  **Post-Processing Filter (Implement a Post-Processing Filter):**\n    *   **Question-Answer Similarity:** Implement a post-processing step that assesses the similarity between the question and each component of the answer. This can be achieved by:\n        *   Using cosine similarity or other semantic similarity measures between the question and segments of the answer.\n        *   Removing answer segments with low similarity scores, indicating they are not directly responsive to the question.\n        *   Breaking the answers into sentences or phrases.\n        *   Assign a score to each based on its relevance.\n        *   Filter any low scores.\n    *   **Information Retrieval:** Use information retrieval techniques (e.g., TF-IDF, BM25) to rank the importance of different parts of the answer based on the question. Remove low-ranking parts.\n\n3.  **Training Data Augmentation (Implement Negative Examples):**\n    *   **Focus on Over-Generalization:** Create new training examples specifically designed to address the over-generalization issue. These examples should:\n        *   Include passages and questions where providing extra information leads to an incorrect answer.\n        *   Emphasize the importance of only including the *most relevant* details.\n        *   Use similar domain data.\n\n4.  **Introduce Solution Validation Layer:**\n    *   **Evaluation Rubric:** Create an explicit rubric or set of criteria for validating the generated answers. This rubric should penalize answers that:\n        *   Include information not directly asked for in the question.\n        *   Provide a longer or more complex answer than necessary.\n        *   Include context.\n\n5.  **Expand Sample Set:**\n    *   **Include Numerical Reasoning Test Cases:** Add sample execution outputs that specifically test the system's numerical reasoning capabilities. This will allow for better monitoring and analysis of that aspect of its performance.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is currently **stable but with significant potential for improvement**. The system demonstrates a foundation of understanding and information extraction, but the lack of precision limits its overall effectiveness. Implementing the recommendations above should lead to a clear upward trend in performance.\n"

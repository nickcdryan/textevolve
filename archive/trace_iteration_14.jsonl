Mohan (1986) indicated in India a total of 424,000 amputees (23,500 annually), of which 10.3% had an onset of disability below the age of 14, amounting to a total of about 43,700 limb deficient children in India alone.\n\nQUESTION: How many percent of amputees in India did had an onset of disability over the age of 14?\n        Synthesized Answer: 89.7\n\n\n        Example 1:\n        Original Question: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?\n        Synthesized Answer: 59\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Example 2:\n        Original Question: What percent of Hispaniola did the germans own?\n        Synthesized Answer: 80\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Is the answer correct and complete?

Due to geography, the Qing army  was at first unable to engage their more mobile enemy. Eventually, they met the Dzungars and defeated them. This campaign cost the treasury at least eight million silver taels. Later in Yongzheng's reign, he sent a small army of 10,000 to fight the Dzungars again. However, that army was annihilated near the Khoton Lake in 1731 and the Qing Empire once again faced the danger of losing control of Mongolia. A Khalkha ally of the Qing Empire would finally defeat the Dzungars a year later in 1732 near the Erdene Zuu Monastery in Mongolia. The Qing then made peace with the Dzungar Khanate and decided the border between them. The Han Chinese General Yue Zhongqi  conquered Tibet for the Qing during the Dzungar-Qing War and attacked the Dzungars at Urumqi in Xinjiang. The Oirats were battled against by Yue Zhongqi.

In cases where almost all UN members or sovereign states participate, such as the World Health Organization, the ROC has been completely shut out, while in others, such as the World Trade Organization  and International Olympic Committee  the ROC participates under unusual names: \"Chinese Taipei\" in the case of APEC and the IOC, and the \"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kimmen and Matsu\"  in the case of the WTO. The issue of ROC's name came under scrutiny during the 2006 World Baseball Classic. The organizers of the 16-team tournament intended to call Taiwan as such, but reverted to \"Chinese Taipei\" under pressure from PRC. The ROC protested the decision, claiming that the WBC is not an IOC event, but did not prevail. The ISO 3166 directory of names of countries and territories registers Taiwan  separately from and in addition to the People's Republic of China , but lists Taiwan as \"Taiwan, Province of China\" based on the name used by the UN under PRC pressure. In ISO 3166-2:CN, Taiwan is also coded CN-71 under China, thus making Taiwan part of China in ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 categories.

Most of the rebels chose to flee to Montenegro which became a base for large number of rebels determined to attack the Ottoman Empire. Ismail Kemal Bey and Tiranli Cemal bey traveled from Italy to Montenegro at the end of May and met the rebels to convince them to adopt the nationalistic agenda which they eventually did. On 12 June Porte prematurely proclaimed that the revolt had ended.\n\nQUESTION: How many months after the chieftains rejected Turgut Pasha's proclamation did Porte proclaim the revolt had ended?\n\n            Reasoning result: The chieftains rejected Turgut Pasha's proclamation on May 18. Porte proclaimed the revolt had ended on June 12. The time between these two dates is less than a month. Therefore, the answer is 0.\n\n\n            Example 1:\n            Original Question: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?\n            Reasoning result: Chris Johnson's first touchdown was 6 yards and Jason Hanson's first field goal was 53 yards, therefore the answer is 59 yards.\n            Valid\n\n            Example 2:\n            Original Question: Who caught the final touchdown of the game?\n            Reasoning result: Wes Welker caught the final touchdown of the game, therefore the answer is Wes Welker.\n            Valid\n            ", "system_instruction": "You are a Holistic Reading & Arithmetic Reasoner.

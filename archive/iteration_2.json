  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by extracting information from a question using `extract_meeting_info` and verifying it with `verify_extracted_info` within `extract_info_and_verify`. It uses an LLM to extract details like participants, duration, and schedules, then verifies the extracted information. Available time slots are found, filtered by constraints using an LLM, and the best slot is proposed. The `call_llm` function is used to interface with the LLM, and the main function orchestrates the process.",

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amanda and Nathan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nAmanda is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nNathan is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nAmanda do not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00. Nathan can not meet on Monday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: "

This indicates a `JSONDecodeError`, meaning the system is attempting to parse a string as JSON, but the string is either empty or doesn't contain valid JSON data. This suggests that the LLM is failing to produce the expected JSON output or is not producing any output at all. The repeated occurrence of this error points to a systemic issue in the system's reliance on JSON formatting and its inability to handle cases where the LLM doesn't provide a correctly formatted response.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Task Definition:** The prompt provides a clear definition of the task (meeting scheduling) and its constraints.\n2.  **Structured Input:** The input is well-structured, providing information about participants, schedules, and preferences in a readable format.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **JSON Parsing Dependency:** The system heavily relies on the LLM producing valid JSON, making it fragile when the LLM fails to do so.\n2.  **Error Handling:** The system's error handling is limited to reporting \"Error: Could not extract or verify meeting information,\" without providing more specific debugging information or attempting to recover from the error.\n3.  **Information Extraction:** The system consistently fails to extract the necessary information (participant schedules, constraints) from the input text.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM Output Reliability:** The system's performance is bottlenecked by the LLM's inconsistent ability to produce valid JSON output. This leads to parsing errors and prevents further processing.\n2.  **Robust Information Extraction:** The system's inability to reliably extract the required information from the input text is a major bottleneck, as this information is crucial for generating valid meeting schedules.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring error pattern is the `JSONDecodeError`, indicating that the LLM is failing to return a valid JSON object. This suggests a problem with either the LLM's output formatting or the system's ability to handle non-JSON responses. All the cases result in the same generic error message, obscuring the specifics of each failure.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the system's **reliance on perfectly formatted JSON output from the LLM without any robust fallback mechanisms or error correction**. When the LLM fails to provide valid JSON (which is happening consistently), the entire process grinds to a halt. This is compounded by insufficient error handling, which provides only a generic error message instead of specific debugging information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Robustness in Information Extraction:** The system needs to be more robust in extracting meeting-related information, even when the LLM's output is imperfect or incomplete.\n2.  **JSON Parsing Error Handling:** Implement more sophisticated error handling for JSON parsing failures, including:\n    *   Checking if the LLM output is a valid JSON string *before* attempting to parse it.\n    *   Using try-except blocks to catch `JSONDecodeError` exceptions.\n    *   If parsing fails, implement a fallback strategy:\n        *   Attempt to extract relevant information from the raw string output using alternative methods (e.g., regular expressions, string manipulation).\n        *   Re-prompt the LLM with a more specific instruction to return valid JSON, including examples of the expected format.\n3.  **Error Reporting:** Provide more informative error messages that indicate the specific cause of the failure and potential solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Output Validation:** Before attempting to parse the LLM output as JSON, check if it appears to be a valid JSON string (e.g., starts and ends with curly braces, contains key-value pairs).\n2.  **Fallback Information Extraction:** If JSON parsing fails, attempt to extract the needed information (participants, schedule constraints, duration) using regular expressions or other string manipulation techniques as a backup.\n3.  **Re-prompting with JSON Format Examples:** If the initial LLM response is not valid JSON, re-prompt the LLM with a clear instruction to return valid JSON, providing an example of the desired format.\n4.  **Implement a \"Plan B\" Solution Generation:** If information extraction fails completely, implement a basic rule-based solution generator that can provide a default meeting time. This would at least provide *some* output instead of a complete failure.\n5.  **Modularize Information Extraction:** Break down the information extraction process into smaller, more manageable steps, and verify the output of each step. This will make it easier to identify the specific point of failure.\n6.  **Add Logging and Debugging:** Include detailed logging statements to track the flow of execution and the values of key variables.

The LLM is either returning an empty string or a non-JSON string, causing the `JSONDecodeError`. The repeated error messages suggest a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents. The lack of specific error information hinders debugging and targeted improvements. The current approach completely halts at the first sign of malformed JSON, indicating a lack of resilience.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capability in meeting scheduling. While it possesses a clear task definition and structured input, its reliance on perfect JSON output from the LLM makes it extremely fragile. The system effectively fails 100% of the time with the current error rate. Information extraction and error handling are severely deficient. The system has no capability to handle variations in LLM output or to recover from errors.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Task Definition:** The prompt provides a well-defined task.\n2.  **Structured Input:** The input is provided in a readable format, which *could* be an advantage if the system could process it.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **JSON Parsing Dependency:** The system's reliance on perfect JSON output is its primary weakness.\n2.  **Error Handling:** Inadequate error handling prevents graceful failure and recovery.\n3.  **Information Extraction:** The system cannot reliably extract necessary meeting information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **ROBUST JSON PARSING AND ERROR HANDLING**. Without this, the entire system is non-functional. This must include fallback mechanisms to deal with non-JSON responses from the LLM.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement JSON Output Validation:**\n    *   Before attempting to parse the LLM's response with `json.loads()`, use a function like `is_json()` (see below) to check if the response *looks* like JSON.\n    ```python\n    import json\n\n    def is_json(myjson):\n        try:\n            json.loads(myjson)\n        except ValueError as e:\n            return False\n        return True\n    ```\n2.  **Implement Try-Except Blocks with Fallback:**\n    *   Wrap the `json.loads()` call in a `try...except JSONDecodeError` block.\n    *   Inside the `except` block, implement a fallback strategy:\n        *   **First Attempt:** Re-prompt the LLM with a specific request for JSON in a defined format (see example below).\n        *   **Second Attempt (If Re-prompting Fails):** Use regex or string manipulation to extract key pieces of information (participants, date, time) from the raw LLM output. Even imperfect extraction is better than a complete failure.\n\n        ```python\n        try:\n            meeting_info = json.loads(llm_response)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n            # Re-prompt the LLM to provide JSON in a specific format\n            reprompt_message = \"The previous response was not valid JSON. Please provide the meeting information in the following JSON format:\\n\" + \\\n                                \"{\\n\" + \\\n                                '  \"participants\": [\"name1\", \"name2\"],\\n' + \\\n                                '  \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\\n' + \\\n                                '  \"time\": \"HH:MM\"\\n' + \\\n                                \"}\"\n            llm_response = call_llm(reprompt_message) # Assuming you have a call_llm function\n            try:\n                meeting_info = json.loads(llm_response) # Try parsing again\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                # Fallback to regex or string manipulation\n                participants = re.findall(r\"Participant: (.*)\", llm_response) # Example regex\n                date = re.search(r\"Date: (\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2})\", llm_response) # Example regex\n                # ... more regex patterns\n                meeting_info = {\"participants\": participants, \"date\": date.group(1) if date else None}\n        ```\n3.  **Provide Informative Error Messages:**\n    *   In the `except` block, log the specific error message from `JSONDecodeError` and the raw LLM output for debugging.\n    *   Return a more informative error message to the user, indicating the nature of the problem and potentially suggesting corrective actions.\n4.  **Limit Re-prompting Attempts:** To prevent infinite loops, only attempt to re-prompt the LLM a maximum of 2 times.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability is currently **STABLE at a zero-functionality level**. Without addressing the JSON parsing issue, there is no possibility of improvement. The next iteration must focus on the recommendations above to move the system beyond this initial failure state.\n```",

The system has no capability to handle variations in LLM output or to recover from errors.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Task Definition:** The prompt provides a well-defined task.\n2.  **Structured Input:** The input is provided in a readable format, which *could* be an advantage if the system could process it.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **JSON Parsing Dependency:** The system's reliance on perfect JSON output is its primary weakness.\n2.  **Error Handling:** Inadequate error handling prevents graceful failure and recovery.\n3.  **Information Extraction:** The system cannot reliably extract necessary meeting information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **ROBUST JSON PARSING AND ERROR HANDLING**. Without this, the entire system is non-functional. This must include fallback mechanisms to deal with non-JSON responses from the LLM.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement JSON Output Validation:**\n    *   Before attempting to parse the LLM's response with `json.loads()`, use a function like `is_json()` (see below) to check if the response *looks* like JSON.\n    ```python\n    import json\n\n    def is_json(myjson):\n        try:\n            json.loads(myjson)\n        except ValueError as e:\n            return False\n        return True\n    ```\n2.  **Implement Try-Except Blocks with Fallback:**\n    *   Wrap the `json.loads()` call in a `try...except JSONDecodeError` block.\n    *   Inside the `except` block, implement a fallback strategy:\n        *   **First Attempt:** Re-prompt the LLM with a specific request for JSON in a defined format (see example below).\n        *   **Second Attempt (If Re-prompting Fails):** Use regex or string manipulation to extract key pieces of information (participants, date, time) from the raw LLM output. Even imperfect extraction is better than a complete failure.\n\n        ```python\n        try:\n            meeting_info = json.loads(llm_response)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n            # Re-prompt the LLM to provide JSON in a specific format\n            reprompt_message = \"The previous response was not valid JSON. Please provide the meeting information in the following JSON format:\\n\" + \\\n                                \"{\\n\" + \\\n                                '  \"participants\": [\"name1\", \"name2\"],\\n' + \\\n                                '  \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\\n' + \\\n                                '  \"time\": \"HH:MM\"\\n' + \\\n                                \"}\"\n            llm_response = call_llm(reprompt_message) # Assuming you have a call_llm function\n            try:\n                meeting_info = json.loads(llm_response) # Try parsing again\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                # Fallback to regex or string manipulation\n                participants = re.findall(r\"Participant: (.*)\", llm_response) # Example regex\n                date = re.search(r\"Date: (\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2})\", llm_response) # Example regex\n                # ... more regex patterns\n                meeting_info = {\"participants\": participants, \"date\": date.group(1) if date else None}\n        ```\n3.  **Provide Informative Error Messages:**\n    *   In the `except` block, log the specific error message from `JSONDecodeError` and the raw LLM output for debugging.\n    *   Return a more informative error message to the user, indicating the nature of the problem and potentially suggesting corrective actions.\n4.  **Limit Re-prompting Attempts:** To prevent infinite loops, only attempt to re-prompt the LLM a maximum of 2 times.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability is currently **STABLE at a zero-functionality level**. Without addressing the JSON parsing issue, there is no possibility of improvement. The next iteration must focus on the recommendations above to move the system beyond this initial failure state.\n```"

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by summarizing schedules, generating slots, filtering slots, and selecting the best slot using a chain-of-thought approach with the LLM acting as an expert in each stage. The main function orchestrates the workflow, calling `summarize_schedules` to structure the schedule, `generate_meeting_slots` to create potential slots, `filter_meeting_slots` to remove invalid times, and `select_best_meeting_slot` to finalize the meeting time based on preferences. `call_llm` is used for interacting with the LLM, passing system instructions and prompts to perform reasoning, summarization, filtering, and selection.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThe predominant runtime error across all samples is the generic \"Error generating possible meeting slots.\" This suggests a systemic issue within the solution generation component. However, without more detailed logs, it's impossible to determine the precise cause (e.g., exceeding iteration limits, failing to find any valid slot within the search space, hitting an unhandled exception, or incorrect parsing of participant schedules).\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Clear Problem Definition:** The system is given a well-defined task: scheduling meetings within specified constraints.\n2.  **Structured Input:** The system receives structured information about participant schedules, meeting duration, and preferences.\n3.  **Constraint-Aware Design:** The system is designed to take into account constraints when scheduling meetings.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Poor Error Handling:** The system returns a generic error message without providing specific details about the cause of the failure.\n2.  **Solution Generation Failure:** The system frequently fails to generate feasible meeting slots, despite the problem statement indicating a solution exists.\n3.  **Lack of Transparency:** The system provides no intermediate reasoning steps or logs to understand why the solution generation failed.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Solution Generation Logic:** The primary bottleneck is the solution generation logic. It appears unable to effectively handle the constraints and schedules to produce valid meeting slots.\n2.  **Error Reporting and Debugging:** The lack of detailed error messages or intermediate reasoning steps makes it extremely difficult to debug the root cause of the failures.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **\"Error generating possible meeting slots\":** This error occurs consistently across all error cases, indicating a recurring failure in the core scheduling algorithm.\n2. **Discrepancy between System and Golden Answer:** The system consistently reports an error, while the golden answer presents a plausible solution, highlighting a significant gap in the system's capabilities.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **inability to effectively generate valid meeting slots, given the constraints and participant schedules.** The current solution generation component seems to be either incorrectly implemented or unable to handle the complexity of real-world scheduling scenarios.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Solution Generation:** Improve the algorithm used to generate feasible meeting slots. This may involve refining the search strategy, improving constraint handling, or optimizing the code for performance.\n2.  **Error Reporting:** Implement more detailed error reporting to provide specific information about the cause of the failure. This will aid in debugging and identifying the root cause of issues.\n3.  **Logging and Debugging:** Add logging to track the reasoning process and intermediate steps taken by the system. This will provide greater transparency into the system's behavior and aid in debugging.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement logging to track the scheduling process:** Log each constraint, participant schedule, and the resulting generated slots, so it is possible to see why a valid solution was not generated.\n\n2.  **Refactor the solution generation algorithm:**\n    *   Use a constraint satisfaction solver (e.g., OR-Tools) to efficiently find feasible meeting slots.\n    *   Implement backtracking search with constraint propagation to explore the solution space more effectively.\n    *   Optimize the code for performance to reduce the likelihood of timeouts or exceeding iteration limits.\n3.  **Implement unit tests for solution generation:**\n    *   Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests to verify the correctness of the solution generation algorithm.\n    *   Include test cases that cover a variety of scheduling scenarios, including different numbers of participants, constraints, and preferences.\n4.  **Add specific error handling:**\n    *   Catch exceptions and provide detailed error messages that indicate the cause of the failure.\n    *   Implement checks to ensure that the input data is valid and consistent.\n    *   Handle cases where no feasible meeting slots can be found within the search space.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed - Unable to properly apply constraints for Raymond, Sophia, Lori and Dorothy\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Error generating possible meeting slots.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed - Error extracting constraints such as \"Douglas do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the provided information, following the requested format:\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe raw execution outputs are consistently reporting a generic \"Error generating possible meeting slots.\" This indicates a complete failure in the core function of the system \u2013 finding a viable meeting time. The consistency of the error across all samples points to a fundamental flaw in the solution generation algorithm or its interaction with the input data/constraints. The fact that no alternative solutions or even partial results are returned suggests that the error occurs early in the process, preventing any meaningful progress. There's no evidence of successful constraint handling, information extraction, or any other higher-level function, as the system never gets past the initial solution generation. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags suggest a structured output format is intended, but the actual content is always just the error message.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system currently has extremely limited capabilities. Its primary function, scheduling meetings based on constraints, is entirely non-functional, evidenced by the 0% accuracy. While the design appears to be constraint-aware, this is theoretical, as the system cannot apply these constraints in practice. The system demonstrates a basic understanding of the problem domain (meeting scheduling) but lacks the algorithms and implementation necessary to solve it. It extracts data, but the extraction fails and causes an error that ends the entire process. There is no demonstrated capability for error recovery or alternative solution generation. The system is essentially a placeholder for a scheduling algorithm, not a working solution.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Clear Problem Definition & Structured Input:** The system is given well defined input that follows the expected format. This makes improvements possible and provides a good foundation.\n*   **Constraint-Aware Design (Theoretical):** The *intention* to handle constraints is a good starting point, but this needs to be implemented effectively.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Complete Failure of Solution Generation:** The system cannot generate valid meeting slots.\n*   **Poor Error Handling and Reporting:** Generic error messages provide no actionable information.\n*   **Lack of Constraint Handling:** The system fails to properly apply constraints, even simple ones.\n*   **Inability to Extract Information:** The system fails to extract the information needed to properly schedule a meeting\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Solution Generation**. The system *must* be able to generate feasible meeting slots, even if initially under simplified conditions (e.g., fewer participants, relaxed constraints).\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Replace the current, failing algorithm:** Implement a basic, functional solution generation algorithm as a priority. Consider:\n    *   **Simplified Algorithm:** Start with an extremely simple algorithm (e.g., brute-force search with minimal constraints) to get *something* working. Get it working, *then* make it better.\n    *   **Constraint Satisfaction Solver:** Integrate a constraint satisfaction solver library (like OR-Tools) to handle the constraints directly. This is the preferred approach in the long run.\n2.  **Implement Detailed Logging:** Add comprehensive logging at every stage of the solution generation process, including:\n    *   Input data received\n    *   Constraints being considered\n    *   Possible meeting slots being evaluated\n    *   Reasons for rejecting slots\n    *   The final \"solution\" (even if it's an error)\n3.  **Focus on Basic Constraint Handling:** Ensure the system can correctly handle the *simplest* constraints (e.g., \"Participant A is unavailable on Monday\").

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThe predominant runtime error across all samples is the generic \"Error generating possible meeting slots.\" This suggests a systemic issue within the solution generation component. However, without more detailed logs, it's impossible to determine the precise cause (e.g., exceeding iteration limits, failing to find any valid slot within the search space, hitting an unhandled exception, or incorrect parsing of participant schedules).\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Clear Problem Definition:** The system is given a well-defined task: scheduling meetings within specified constraints.\n2.  **Structured Input:** The system receives structured information about participant schedules, meeting duration, and preferences.\n3.  **Constraint-Aware Design:** The system is designed to take into account constraints when scheduling meetings.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Poor Error Handling:** The system returns a generic error message without providing specific details about the cause of the failure.\n2.  **Solution Generation Failure:** The system frequently fails to generate feasible meeting slots, despite the problem statement indicating a solution exists.\n3.  **Lack of Transparency:** The system provides no intermediate reasoning steps or logs to understand why the solution generation failed.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Solution Generation Logic:** The primary bottleneck is the solution generation logic. It appears unable to effectively handle the constraints and schedules to produce valid meeting slots.\n2.  **Error Reporting and Debugging:** The lack of detailed error messages or intermediate reasoning steps makes it extremely difficult to debug the root cause of the failures.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **\"Error generating possible meeting slots\":** This error occurs consistently across all error cases, indicating a recurring failure in the core scheduling algorithm.\n2. **Discrepancy between System and Golden Answer:** The system consistently reports an error, while the golden answer presents a plausible solution, highlighting a significant gap in the system's capabilities.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **inability to effectively generate valid meeting slots, given the constraints and participant schedules.** The current solution generation component seems to be either incorrectly implemented or unable to handle the complexity of real-world scheduling scenarios.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Solution Generation:** Improve the algorithm used to generate feasible meeting slots. This may involve refining the search strategy, improving constraint handling, or optimizing the code for performance.\n2.  **Error Reporting:** Implement more detailed error reporting to provide specific information about the cause of the failure. This will aid in debugging and identifying the root cause of issues.\n3.  **Logging and Debugging:** Add logging to track the reasoning process and intermediate steps taken by the system. This will provide greater transparency into the system's behavior and aid in debugging.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement logging to track the scheduling process:** Log each constraint, participant schedule, and the resulting generated slots, so it is possible to see why a valid solution was not generated.\n\n2.  **Refactor the solution generation algorithm:**\n    *   Use a constraint satisfaction solver (e.g., OR-Tools) to efficiently find feasible meeting slots.\n    *   Implement backtracking search with constraint propagation to explore the solution space more effectively.\n    *   Optimize the code for performance to reduce the likelihood of timeouts or exceeding iteration limits.\n3.  **Implement unit tests for solution generation:**\n    *   Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests to verify the correctness of the solution generation algorithm.\n    *   Include test cases that cover a variety of scheduling scenarios, including different numbers of participants, constraints, and preferences.\n4.  **Add specific error handling:**\n    *   Catch exceptions and provide detailed error messages that indicate the cause of the failure.\n    *   Implement checks to ensure that the input data is valid and consistent.\n    *   Handle cases where no feasible meeting slots can be found within the search space.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed - Unable to properly apply constraints for Raymond, Sophia, Lori and Dorothy\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Error generating possible meeting slots.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed - Error extracting constraints such as \"Douglas do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30. Tuesday. Wednesday.\" and Zachary's preferences\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed - Unable to properly apply constraints for Douglas and Zachary\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Error generating possible meeting slots.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed - Unable to properly apply constraints for Jack, Dylan, Janice, Willie, Donna, Peter and Raymond\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Error generating possible meeting slots.\n*   **Sample ID 3:**\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed - Unable to properly apply constraints for Raymond and Gerald\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Error generating possible meeting slots.\n*   **Sample ID 4:**\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed - Unable to properly apply constraints for Amanda and Nathan. It fails to handle the \"Amanda do not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00\" and \"Nathan can not meet on Monday\" constraints\n    *   solution_generation: Failed - Error generating possible meeting slots.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the provided information, following the requested format:\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe raw execution outputs are consistently reporting a generic \"Error generating possible meeting slots.\" This indicates a complete failure in the core function of the system \u2013 finding a viable meeting time. The consistency of the error across all samples points to a fundamental flaw in the solution generation algorithm or its interaction with the input data/constraints. The fact that no alternative solutions or even partial results are returned suggests that the error occurs early in the process, preventing any meaningful progress. There's no evidence of successful constraint handling, information extraction, or any other higher-level function, as the system never gets past the initial solution generation. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags suggest a structured output format is intended, but the actual content is always just the error message.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system currently has extremely limited capabilities. Its primary function, scheduling meetings based on constraints, is entirely non-functional, evidenced by the 0% accuracy. While the design appears to be constraint-aware, this is theoretical, as the system cannot apply these constraints in practice. The system demonstrates a basic understanding of the problem domain (meeting scheduling) but lacks the algorithms and implementation necessary to solve it. It extracts data, but the extraction fails and causes an error that ends the entire process. There is no demonstrated capability for error recovery or alternative solution generation. The system is essentially a placeholder for a scheduling algorithm, not a working solution.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Clear Problem Definition & Structured Input:** The system is given well defined input that follows the expected format. This makes improvements possible and provides a good foundation.\n*   **Constraint-Aware Design (Theoretical):** The *intention* to handle constraints is a good starting point, but this needs to be implemented effectively.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Complete Failure of Solution Generation:** The system cannot generate valid meeting slots.\n*   **Poor Error Handling and Reporting:** Generic error messages provide no actionable information.\n*   **Lack of Constraint Handling:** The system fails to properly apply constraints, even simple ones.\n*   **Inability to Extract Information:** The system fails to extract the information needed to properly schedule a meeting\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Solution Generation**. The system *must* be able to generate feasible meeting slots, even if initially under simplified conditions (e.g., fewer participants, relaxed constraints).\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Replace the current, failing algorithm:** Implement a basic, functional solution generation algorithm as a priority. Consider:\n    *   **Simplified Algorithm:** Start with an extremely simple algorithm (e.g., brute-force search with minimal constraints) to get *something* working. Get it working, *then* make it better.\n    *   **Constraint Satisfaction Solver:** Integrate a constraint satisfaction solver library (like OR-Tools) to handle the constraints directly. This is the preferred approach in the long run.\n2.  **Implement Detailed Logging:** Add comprehensive logging at every stage of the solution generation process, including:\n    *   Input data received\n    *   Constraints being considered\n    *   Possible meeting slots being evaluated\n    *   Reasons for rejecting slots\n    *   The final \"solution\" (even if it's an error)\n3.  **Focus on Basic Constraint Handling:** Ensure the system can correctly handle the *simplest* constraints (e.g., \"Participant A is unavailable on Monday\"). Get this working reliably before adding more complex constraints.\n4.  **Implement Unit Tests:** Create unit tests specifically targeting the solution generation function and basic constraint handling. These tests will help verify that the algorithm is working correctly and prevent regressions in future development.\n5.  **LLM-First Information Extraction:**\n    - **Remove regex and brittle parsing of the input data.**\n    - **Replace the parsing logic with LLM information extraction calls.**\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nThe current capability trend is **Stable (at Zero)**. The system consistently fails to perform its core function. No progress is being made. Without significant changes, the trend will remain flat.\n"

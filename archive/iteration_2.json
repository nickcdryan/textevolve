The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates this process, calling `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API. There are 3 distinct agent roles based on the different prompt instructions. The overall workflow involves extraction, description, transformation, and validation, using string parsing with regex in between to help extract and organize the data.",

    "error_analysis": {
      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\n*   **Sample 1:** No explicit runtime error, but the output is a matrix filled with \"1\" instead of the correct transformation. This suggests a logical error in the transformation algorithm or reasoning process, rather than a runtime exception.\n*   **Sample 2:** \"Invalid output format\" is reported. Validation identified that the element at `[10][10]` should be `4`, but was `0` in the system output. This points to an error in applying the learned transformation or in the output formatting.\n*   **Sample 3:** \"Invalid output format\" is reported.  The system generated a nested structure containing dictionaries within lists, instead of a 2D array of numbers ( `[[number, number],[number, number]]` ). This indicates a critical failure in producing the correct output data structure. The prompt specifically asked for a 2D array and the code did not deliver.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Format Validation:** The format validation detected output formatting errors in Samples 2 and 3, preventing incorrect solutions from being accepted.\n*   **Error Detection:** The system is able to detect inconsistencies between the expected output and the actual output (Sample 2), indicating some capacity for self-checking.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to recognize and apply the grid transformation patterns from the training examples to the test inputs (Samples 1 and 2).\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system consistently fails to produce the correct output format when the problem involves grid transformations (Samples 2 and 3).\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** The system seems highly sensitive to the structure and format of the input, leading to errors even when the underlying pattern is relatively simple.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Grid Transformation Logic:** The core grid transformation logic is flawed. It either fails to correctly identify the underlying pattern or cannot translate the identified pattern into a functional transformation (Samples 1 and 2).\n*   **Output Format Enforcement:** The system generates outputs that don't adhere to the specified 2D array structure (Samples 2 and 3). The post-processing or generation step responsible for formatting the output is not functioning correctly or is not being enforced strongly enough.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Grid Transformation:** The primary error pattern is the inability to correctly transform the input grid based on the training examples. The system produces either completely wrong outputs (Sample 1) or partially incorrect outputs (Sample 2).\n*   **Output Format Violations:** A recurring pattern is the failure to adhere to the specified output format. The system struggles to generate a valid 2D array structure (Sample 3), even when explicitly requested.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Shallow Patterns:** The system seems to be picking up on superficial patterns rather than the underlying logic of the transformations. This is evident in the \"1\" matrix output in Sample 1, which likely results from simply filling the matrix with a default value.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inability to accurately perform grid transformations**. The current approach lacks a robust and reliable algorithm for identifying and applying the transformation patterns, leading to incorrect and often nonsensical outputs. The fact that the system doesn't produce a grid which the validator can even evaluate correctly is a major problem.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Transformation Algorithm:** Develop a more sophisticated algorithm for recognizing and applying grid transformation patterns. Consider techniques like:\n    *   Analyzing the differences between input and output grids in the training examples to identify the transformation rules.\n    *   Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or similar techniques to learn spatial relationships and patterns in the grids.\n    *   Implementing a more rule-based approach that explicitly defines the possible transformation operations (e.g., mirroring, rotation, shifting, value replacement).\n*   **Output Formatting:** Implement a stricter output formatting module that enforces the specified 2D array structure. This could involve:\n    *   Using a dedicated function or class to generate the output grid.\n    *   Adding a post-processing step to check and correct the output format before submission.\n    *   Providing clearer and more explicit instructions in the prompt regarding the required output format.\n*   **Robustness:** Make the system more robust to variations in input format and structure. Consider adding input validation and preprocessing steps to handle different grid sizes, value ranges, and noise levels.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Hybrid Approach for Transformation:** Combine LLM reasoning with a deterministic algorithm. Use the LLM to *extract* the transformation rule from the training examples (e.g., \"replace each value with the value above it\"). Then, implement a Python function that *applies* this rule to the test input.\n2.  **Implement Step-by-Step Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** Force the system to explicitly describe its reasoning process at each step of the transformation. This will make it easier to identify where the reasoning goes wrong. For example:\n    *   \"Step 1: Analyze the training examples and identify the transformation rule.\"\n    *   \"Step 2: Apply the transformation rule to the test input.\"\n    *   \"Step 3: Format the output as a 2D array.\"\n3.  **Use Few-Shot Examples Strategically:** Provide more diverse training examples that cover different types of transformations (e.g., mirroring, rotation, value replacement). Also, include examples with step-by-step reasoning to guide the system's reasoning process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful, but didn't extract the correct transformation pattern.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid solution based on the extracted pattern.\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   solution\\_verification: Identified that the [10][10] position had different values in the output and transformed output, highlighting an error.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate the correct transformation.\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid solution (incorrect output format).\n    *   solution\\_verification: Correctly identified the invalid output format.\n",

This indicates a complete failure in recognizing and applying the transformation rule. It's likely the system defaulted to a placeholder output when it couldn't identify a meaningful transformation. There's no runtime error, suggesting the *code* executed, but the *logic* was fundamentally flawed.\n*   **Sample 2:** The \"Invalid output format\" error arises because the transformed output sets element `[10][10]` to `0` instead of the expected `4`. This indicates a partial failure in applying the transformation rule. The validator correctly flagged this inconsistency. The system attempted a transformation, but did so incorrectly. This is a more nuanced failure than sample 1, hinting at some pattern recognition, but ultimately incorrect application. The fact that the validator can identify specific incorrect elements is useful feedback.\n*   **Sample 3:** The \"Invalid output format\" error occurs because the system produced a nested structure of dictionaries within lists instead of a 2D array of numbers. This indicates a major failure in output formatting. The system seems to completely misunderstand the required output structure. This failure, coupled with the others, highlights the system's struggle with structured output, especially in grid-like formats.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates very limited capability in performing grid transformations. Its accuracy is 0%, indicating a complete inability to solve the given problems. While the format validation and error detection mechanisms are functional, they are rendered useless by the system's inability to generate correct solutions. The core problem-solving logic is severely deficient.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Format Validation:** The system's ability to validate the output format and identify inconsistencies between the expected and actual output is a valuable strength. This prevents incorrect solutions from being accepted.\n*   **Error Detection:** The system's capability to detect errors, even at a granular level (e.g., identifying the incorrect element in Sample 2), suggests some capacity for self-checking and potential for future improvement.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Grid Transformation Logic:** The system lacks a robust algorithm for identifying and applying grid transformation patterns. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system consistently fails to produce the correct output format, even when explicitly requested.\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to recognize and generalize patterns from training examples to new inputs.\n*    **Reasoning & Information Extraction:** The system cannot reliably extract the correct transformations from the provided training examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Grid Transformation Logic**. Without a functional transformation algorithm, the system cannot solve the problems, regardless of its strengths in other areas.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Hybrid Approach for Transformation (Exploration Focus):** Combine LLM reasoning with a deterministic algorithm. Use the LLM to *extract* the transformation rule from the training examples in natural language (e.g., \"replace each value with the value above it\"). Then, implement a Python function that *applies* this rule to the test input. This allows the LLM to focus on what it's good at (reasoning), and the code to handle precise application. Add a stage to ask the LLM to verify that the generated Python code actually implements the intended transformation.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** A hybrid approach will improve transformation accuracy by leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability and the deterministic nature of Python code.\n\n2.  **Implement Step-by-Step Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (Exploration Focus):** Force the system to explicitly describe its reasoning process at each step of the transformation. This will make it easier to identify where the reasoning goes wrong.\n    *   \"Step 1: Analyze the training examples and identify the transformation rule.\"\n    *   \"Step 2: Apply the transformation rule to the test input.\"\n    *   \"Step 3: Format the output as a 2D array.\"\n    *   **Hypothesis:** Explicit reasoning will improve the system's ability to identify and apply the correct transformation rule by providing a clear trace of the reasoning process.\n\n3. **Implement a Robust Output Formatting Function (Exploitation Focus):** Create a dedicated Python function that ensures the output is *always* a valid 2D array. This function should:\n    *   Take a 2D list of numbers as input.\n    *   Validate that each element is a number.\n    *   Ensure the list has the correct dimensions.\n    *   Return the validated and formatted 2D array as a string.\n    This should be applied as the very last step.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** A dedicated output formatting function will eliminate output format errors, allowing the system to be evaluated solely on its transformation accuracy.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's capabilities are currently **stable** at a very low level. There is no evidence of improvement. The 0% accuracy indicates a complete lack of problem-solving ability. It is important to focus on foundational improvement.\n```",

It either fails to correctly identify the underlying pattern or cannot translate the identified pattern into a functional transformation (Samples 1 and 2).\n*   **Output Format Enforcement:** The system generates outputs that don't adhere to the specified 2D array structure (Samples 2 and 3). The post-processing or generation step responsible for formatting the output is not functioning correctly or is not being enforced strongly enough.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Grid Transformation:** The primary error pattern is the inability to correctly transform the input grid based on the training examples. The system produces either completely wrong outputs (Sample 1) or partially incorrect outputs (Sample 2).\n*   **Output Format Violations:** A recurring pattern is the failure to adhere to the specified output format. The system struggles to generate a valid 2D array structure (Sample 3), even when explicitly requested.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Shallow Patterns:** The system seems to be picking up on superficial patterns rather than the underlying logic of the transformations. This is evident in the \"1\" matrix output in Sample 1, which likely results from simply filling the matrix with a default value.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inability to accurately perform grid transformations**. The current approach lacks a robust and reliable algorithm for identifying and applying the transformation patterns, leading to incorrect and often nonsensical outputs. The fact that the system doesn't produce a grid which the validator can even evaluate correctly is a major problem.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Transformation Algorithm:** Develop a more sophisticated algorithm for recognizing and applying grid transformation patterns. Consider techniques like:\n    *   Analyzing the differences between input and output grids in the training examples to identify the transformation rules.\n    *   Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or similar techniques to learn spatial relationships and patterns in the grids.\n    *   Implementing a more rule-based approach that explicitly defines the possible transformation operations (e.g., mirroring, rotation, shifting, value replacement).\n*   **Output Formatting:** Implement a stricter output formatting module that enforces the specified 2D array structure. This could involve:\n    *   Using a dedicated function or class to generate the output grid.\n    *   Adding a post-processing step to check and correct the output format before submission.\n    *   Providing clearer and more explicit instructions in the prompt regarding the required output format.\n*   **Robustness:** Make the system more robust to variations in input format and structure. Consider adding input validation and preprocessing steps to handle different grid sizes, value ranges, and noise levels.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Hybrid Approach for Transformation:** Combine LLM reasoning with a deterministic algorithm. Use the LLM to *extract* the transformation rule from the training examples (e.g., \"replace each value with the value above it\"). Then, implement a Python function that *applies* this rule to the test input.\n2.  **Implement Step-by-Step Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** Force the system to explicitly describe its reasoning process at each step of the transformation. This will make it easier to identify where the reasoning goes wrong. For example:\n    *   \"Step 1: Analyze the training examples and identify the transformation rule.\"\n    *   \"Step 2: Apply the transformation rule to the test input.\"\n    *   \"Step 3: Format the output as a 2D array.\"\n3.  **Use Few-Shot Examples Strategically:** Provide more diverse training examples that cover different types of transformations (e.g., mirroring, rotation, value replacement). Also, include examples with step-by-step reasoning to guide the system's reasoning process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful, but didn't extract the correct transformation pattern.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid solution based on the extracted pattern.\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   solution\\_verification: Identified that the [10][10] position had different values in the output and transformed output, highlighting an error.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate the correct transformation.\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid solution (incorrect output format).\n    *   solution\\_verification: Correctly identified the invalid output format.\n",

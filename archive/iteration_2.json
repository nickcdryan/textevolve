For instance, the system sometimes incorrectly states which participants are available or unavailable at certain times, leading to wrong conclusions.\n2.  **Preference Handling Errors:** The system has issues with handling preferences, such as meeting at the earliest availability.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Availability Reasoning:** The system's core reasoning about participant availability is unreliable, leading to cascading errors in subsequent steps.\n2. **Erroneous Constraint Handling:** The system is not consistently and accurately applying constraints in decision-making (e.g., Roger's preference in sample 5).\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1. **Incorrect Availability Assessment:** The system frequently miscalculates participant availability, claiming someone is busy when they are free or vice versa. This is evident across multiple samples.\n2. **Misinterpretation of Task:** In sample 6, the system prioritizes the earliest available day over finding any available time on a specific day mentioned in the answer.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate and inconsistent reasoning about participant availability based on their schedules**.

Explain your reasoning step by step.\"\n    *   **Reasoning:** By having a dedicated agent verify availability, we can catch errors in the initial availability calculation and prevent them from propagating through the rest of the system. The step-by-step reasoning requirement forces the LLM to be more explicit and verifiable.\n2. **Implement Multi-Stage Reasoning with Preference Validation:**\n    *   **Specific Change:** After identifying potential time slots, introduce a preference validation stage. For example, for the \"earliest availability\" constraint, the system should explicitly compare all identified slots and provide a clear justification for selecting the earliest one, verified by a separate LLM call: \"Given the following possible meeting times: [List of Times], which is the earliest?

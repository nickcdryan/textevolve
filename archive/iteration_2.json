  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to schedule meetings by extracting information, finding the best time slot, and verifying the time slot against constraints. The problem is decomposed into three steps: information extraction, time slot selection, and verification, each using a distinct LLM call with few-shot examples. There are no explicit agent roles besides LLM calls, but the system leverages few-shot learning examples to allow the LLM to assume the following roles: scheduling expert, time slot determination expert, and time slot verification expert. The functions used are `call_llm`, `extract_scheduling_information`, `find_best_time_slot`, `verify_time_slot`, `format_answer`, and `main`; where `main` orchestrates the process by calling the other functions sequentially to generate a proposed meeting time. The overall workflow involves extracting information, determining a time, verifying it, and then formatting the answer or returning an error.",

The analysis is extremely verbose and ultimately incorrect. This points to a flaw in the logic that aggregates individual availability into a combined schedule. It also lacks a clear final answer format.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system correctly identifies multiple potential slots on Monday. However, it seems to over-emphasize preferences leading to discarding potentially valid meeting days, and shows no consideration for preferences that might be assigned to time slots within a day (e.g. prefer mornings). Its explanation is valid, but the weighting of preferences may be impacting ability to find a valid time. Its final answer format is valid.\n*   **Sample 2:** This returns a simple \"Error: Invalid, No suitable time found\", implying a complete failure in the scheduling process. This could be due to parsing errors or an inability to handle certain schedule configurations. Its output format is valid.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a limited capability to analyze schedules and identify potential meeting slots. However, its accuracy is extremely low and is hampered by flawed availability calculation, inconsistent preference handling, and a lack of rigorous verification. While the intent to consider both hard and soft constraints is present, the execution reveals significant shortcomings in their implementation.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Schedule Parsing:** The system *attempts* to parse schedule information, though with significant inaccuracies.\n*   **Constraint Awareness:** The system recognizes the need to consider both hard (busy times) and soft (preferences) constraints.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Availability Calculation Accuracy:** The system's core logic for determining available time slots is unreliable and frequently produces incorrect results.\n*   **Robust Verification:** There is no evidence of a robust verification step to confirm the validity of proposed solutions.\n*   **Preference Handling:** Preference handling is inconsistent and may not be correctly integrated with hard constraint satisfaction. The impact of preferences on the final decision also needs to be examined.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Availability Calculation Accuracy**. Without an accurate assessment of available time slots, the entire system is rendered ineffective. This requires improving both schedule parsing and constraint handling.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the error analysis and sample execution outputs, here's a prioritized list of actionable recommendations:\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Schedule Parsing Module:** Create a Python-based module that parses the schedule text and represents each participant's availability as a list of time intervals.

  "approach_summary": "This script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by extracting information, finding available time slots, and verifying the solution. The problem is decomposed into three distinct stages, each handled by a specialized agent: information extraction, time slot finding, and solution verification, all implemented via LLM calls with embedded examples. The workflow involves sequentially calling these agents, using the output of one as input to the next, to arrive at a verified meeting time.",

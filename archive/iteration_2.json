  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to solve grid transformation problems by focusing on localized contextual analysis. It decomposes the problem into identifying influencing factors through `analyze_local_contexts`, predicting cell transformations using `predict_cell_transformations`, and verifying the output grid with `verify_output_grid`. The script employs agents with roles like \"expert in analyzing grid transformations\" and \"meticulous grid transformation expert\" for specific tasks. Key functions include `solve_grid_transformation` (overall orchestrator), `analyze_local_contexts` (identifies influencing factors), `predict_cell_transformations` (predicts the output grid), `verify_output_grid` (verifies the output), and `call_llm` (interface with the LLM). The workflow involves analyzing local contexts, predicting transformations based on these factors, and then verifying and refining the predicted grid, using the LLM for each step.",

The system correctly identifies that the task is a grid transformation.\n2.  The system attempts to apply a transformation based on the training examples.\n3.  The system outputs a JSON formatted grid as requested.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  The system struggles to correctly identify the underlying pattern in the transformation.\n2.  The system generates grids that are inconsistent with the pattern demonstrated in the training examples.\n3.  The system does not generalize well to new input grids.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The most critical bottleneck is the system's ability to recognize and generalize patterns from the provided training examples. It seems to be extracting incorrect or incomplete information about the transformations.\n2.  **Constraint Application:** The system appears to struggle with applying the identified pattern consistently across the entire grid, especially when the test grid differs slightly from the training examples.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe primary error pattern is the incorrect application of transformations. In all cases, the system seems to latch onto some aspect of the training examples (like specific numbers and their relative positions) but fails to correctly replicate or extrapolate the full pattern to the test input.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **incorrect pattern generalization and application** from the training examples to the test input.

This could involve analyzing the differences between the input and output grids in the training examples to identify relationships between cell values and positions. Add print statements to see what patterns are being extracted.\n2.  **Constraint Enforcement:** Develop a mechanism to enforce the identified pattern consistently. This could involve creating a function that, given a cell's position and value, predicts the corresponding output cell value based on the extracted pattern.\n3.  **Data Augmentation:** Increase the number and diversity of training examples. This could help the system learn more generalizable patterns and improve its performance on unseen input grids.\n4.  **Introduce intermediate steps**: Add print statements or intermediate outputs to see the changes being applied to the grid at each step of the transformation process. This could help identify where the transformations are going wrong.\n5.  **Decompose the Problem:** Break down the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks.

The placement seems random.\n*   **Sample 1:** The output grid repeats the numbers 3 and 4 in a rigid and repetitive structure. This suggests an attempt to apply a simple pattern but does so incorrectly and without considering the input grid. The repetition also indicates a failure to understand the dynamic relationships between grid elements.\n*   **Sample 2:** This output shows a similar issue: scattered numbers (1,3), and seems to vaguely reference numbers present in the prompt.\n\nIn all three examples, the key issue is that the generated grids do not reflect any discernible pattern derived from potential training data (not provided in this prompt, but assumed). The outputs are inconsistent, seemingly random, and fail to generalize to the new input. They demonstrate a significant flaw in understanding how the input should be transformed into the output.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system's overall capability in performing grid transformations is currently **extremely low**. While it demonstrates the ability to identify the task type (grid transformation) and output data in the correct JSON format, it completely fails to perform the transformation itself.

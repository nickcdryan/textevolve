  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to answer questions by first determining the question type, then extracting relevant information, and finally generating the answer. Each step uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini LLM, acting as a specialized agent for question type classification, information extraction, and answer generation respectively. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow: `determine_question_type` identifies the question type, `extract_relevant_info` extracts needed information based on the question and its type, and `generate_answer` formulates the final answer. Error handling is incorporated at each step, returning an error message if a step fails.",

A strong northern wind aided the Venetian ships in coming close to the walls, and after a short battle approximately seventy crusaders managed to enter the city.

The Anglo-Saxon \"axe bearers\" had been amongst the most effective of the city's defenders, but they now attempted to negotiate higher wages from their Byzantine employers, before dispersing or surrendering. The crusaders captured the Blachernae section of the city in the northwest and used it as a base to attack the rest of the city. While attempting to defend themselves with a wall of fire, however, they burned even more of the city. This second fire left 15,000 people homeless. The crusaders completely took the city on 13 April.

The World News Roundup airs twice every weekday: a morning edition is anchored by Steve Kathan and produced by Paul Farry, while a \"late edition\" is anchored by Dave Barrett and produced by James Hutton. The evening Roundup, previously known as The World Tonight, has aired in its current form since 1956 and has been anchored by Blair Clark, Douglas Edwards, Dallas Townsend and Christopher Glenn . The CBS Radio Network provides newscasts at the top of the hour, regular updates at\u00a0:31 minutes past the hour, the popular Newsfeeds for affiliates  at\u00a0:35 minutes past the hour, and breaking news updates when developments warrant, often at\u00a0:20 and\u00a0:50 minutes past the hour. Skyview Networks handles the distribution.",

Seattle took an early lead with a 1-yard TD run by Marshawn Lynch. Atlanta would later respond early in the second quarter with a Matt Ryan 3-yard TD pass to Jason Snelling, with Matt Bryant later adding a 27-yard field goal to take the lead. Seattle tied the game with a 38-yard field goal from Olindo Mare; however, the Falcons took the lead again with a Ryan 24-yard TD pass to Michael Jenkins to close the first half. On the Seahawks' first offensive possession of the second half, Matt Hasselbeck fumbled the football in the end-zone with defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux recovering for a Falcons' touchdown. Atlanta would later add to their lead with a 25-yard Bryant field goal as well as a Ryan 24-yard TD pass to Roddy White. Seattle's only score of the second half came from backup quarterback Charlie Whitehurst with a 1-yard TD rush followed by a successful 2-point conversion with a Whitehurst pass to Ben Obomanu. With the win, Atlanta improved to 12-2. Also, the Falcons secured a playoff berth early in the game due to Philadelphia's victory over the New York Giants.",

With QB Jake Delhomme's thumb still sore, Chris Weinke once again got the start.  After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina's recent struggles continued with QB Ben Roethlisberger's 1-yard TD run, kicker Jeff Reed's 19-yard field goal, and Roethlisberger's 13-yard TD pass to RB Najeh Davenport.  Afterwards, the Panthers got their only score of the game with kicker John Kasay getting a 37-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, more Panther trouble continued with Reed's 45-yard field goal and RB Willie Parker's 41-yard TD run.

The outputs are clean and consistent in format using `\"ANSWER_START\"` and `\"ANSWER_END\"` tags. However, based solely on these outputs, we cannot determine the context of the question or the passage it's responding to.  The encoded character `&#231;` suggests potential issues with handling special characters which should be tested for robustness. The calculation in the third output (\"1938 - 1927 = 11 years\") shows that the model is including its working in the answer span which may or may not be desirable.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system exhibits strong performance in extracting relevant information and performing basic calculations when prompted with questions. The consistent formatting of its output is also a positive attribute. However, the assessment is severely limited by the *lack of error cases*. A system that appears perfect based on limited positive examples may fail catastrophically when exposed to more challenging scenarios.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accurate Information Retrieval:** The system effectively identifies and extracts the correct answer spans from provided text.\n*   **Consistent Output Formatting:** The use of ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END tags provides a structured output that simplifies downstream processing.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning:** It demonstrates the ability to perform simple arithmetic calculations and include the calculation logic in the output.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Insufficient Error Data:**  The *critical* weakness is the absence of error cases.  Without understanding where the system fails, it's impossible to target improvements effectively.\n*   **Unknown Generalizability:** The system's performance on a wider range of question types, text complexities, and edge cases remains unknown.\n*   **Incomplete Control over Answer Scope:** The inclusion of calculation steps within the answer span may not always be desirable and reflects a lack of fine-grained control over answer selection.\n*   **Character Encoding Considerations:** Handling of special characters (like `&#231;`) need explicit robustness testing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most critical area to improve is generating or acquiring a robust set of *error cases*. This is not an AI improvement; it is a *data improvement*. Without it, further fine-tuning or architectural changes are effectively shooting in the dark.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Prioritize Error Case Generation:** Invest significant effort in creating or acquiring a diverse dataset of challenging questions and passages that are likely to cause the system to fail. This should include:\n    *   Ambiguous questions with multiple possible answers.\n    *   Questions requiring complex reasoning or inference.\n    *   Passages with noisy or irrelevant information.\n    *   Examples with edge cases (e.g., unusual formatting, special characters, long passages).\n2.  **Character Encoding Test Suite:** Build out a character encoding test suite that includes questions designed to expose encoding and decoding problems.\n3.  **Answer Span Precision Test:** Create examples that require precise delimitation of the answer (i.e. situations where the inclusion of surrounding text causes ambiguity or inaccuracy).\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nDue to the lack of error data, it's impossible to accurately assess the capability trend. The system *appears* to be performing well, but this assessment is based on extremely limited information. The trend is currently *unknown* and requires further investigation with a more comprehensive dataset.\n",

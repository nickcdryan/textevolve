  "approach_summary": "The script addresses question answering by first determining the question type and then processing it accordingly. Numerical questions are processed by extracting numerical information and calculating the answer, while general questions are addressed through question decomposition, information extraction, and answer synthesis. The agent roles are: question type identifier, numerical information extractor, calculator, question decomposer, information extraction expert, and answer synthesis expert. Key functions include `determine_question_type`, `process_numerical_question`, `extract_numerical_info`, `calculate_answer`, `process_general_question`, `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, `synthesize_answer`, and `call_llm`; these functions are chained together to process the question and generate an answer using LLM-driven techniques with verification steps at each stage. The overall workflow involves determining question type, processing the question using a type-specific method, and returning the result or an error message.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West divisional rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212; from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome. Peyton Manning finished the day with the first 0.0 passer rating of his career.\n\nQUESTION: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown pass than the longest field goal?",

Tennessee would trail early in the first quarter as Bills running back Fred Jackson threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans.  The Titans would respond as running back Chris Johnson got a 28-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Vince Young hooking up with wide receiver Nate Washington on a 14-yard touchdown pass.

It began with Johnson's 1-yard touchdown run, followed by Bironas' 51-yard field goal.

In recent years, the economy has suffered because of depressed international demand for nickel, due to the ongoing financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel, the substantial financial support from France and tourism are keys to the health of the economy. In the 2000s, large additions were made to nickel mining capacity. The Goro, New Caledonia is expected to be one of the largest nickel producing plants on Earth. When full-scale production begins in 2013 this plant will produce an estimated 20% of the global nickel supply. However, the need to respond to environmental concerns over the countrys globally recognized ecological heritage, may increasingly need to be factored into capitalization of mining operations.\n\nQUESTION: Which country produced more tonnes of nickel in 2009, Canada or Australia?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: The squadron of Vasco da Gama left Portugal in 1497, rounded the Cape and continued along the coast of East Africa, where a local pilot was brought on board who guided them across the Indian Ocean, reaching Calicut in western India in May 1498. The second voyage to India was dispatched in 1500 under Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral. While following the same south-westerly route as Gama across the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral made landfall on the Brazilian coast. This was probably an accidental discovery, but it has been speculated that the Portuguese secretly knew of Brazil's existence and that it lay on their side of the Tordesillas line. Cabral recommended to the Portuguese King that the land be settled, and two follow up voyages were sent in 1501 and 1503. The land was found to be abundant in pau-brasil, or brazilwood, from which it later inherited its name, but the failure to find gold or silver meant that for the time being Portuguese efforts were concentrated on India. On 8 July 1497 the fleet, consisting of four ships and a crew of 170 men, left Lisbon The travel led by Vasco da Gama to Calicut was the starting point for deployment of Portuguese in the African east coast and in the Indian Ocean.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212; from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

The analysis is constrained by the lack of error cases, which limits the depth of understanding regarding system weaknesses and potential bottlenecks.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs reveal the following:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system correctly performs a subtraction calculation and presents the answer clearly. The system includes an explanation/demonstration of its computation which is a positive characteristic.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system provides a single number answer. It's unclear what the question was, but the system seems to have successfully answered.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system provides a correct assertion.\n\n**Overall:** The execution outputs suggest that the system can handle straightforward questions involving numerical calculations and factual recall from a given context. The use of \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END\" tags demonstrates a structured output format, which is beneficial for downstream processing.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a rudimentary level of AI capability. It excels at extracting simple facts and performing basic arithmetic when the necessary information is directly available. However, the absence of error cases makes it impossible to accurately assess its robustness, ability to handle complex reasoning, or deal with ambiguity. The current capability is best described as:\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction and Numerical Calculation:** Proficient in extracting and processing directly stated information and performing simple arithmetic.\n*   **Limited Reasoning:** Lacks the ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning or handle nuanced language.\n*   **Unknown Robustness:** The system's resilience to noisy input, ambiguous questions, or complex scenarios is unknown.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **High Accuracy (Based on Limited Data):** Achieved a perfect accuracy score of 1.00 (5/5), indicating a strong performance on the specific test cases.\n*   **Structured Output Format:** The use of \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END\" tags provides a clear and structured output, facilitating integration with other systems.\n*   **Basic Numerical Reasoning:** The ability to perform arithmetic operations is a valuable asset.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Error Cases:** This is the most significant weakness. The absence of error cases prevents a thorough understanding of the system's limitations and vulnerabilities.\n*   **Limited Reasoning Ability:** The system appears to be constrained by its inability to perform complex reasoning tasks, such as inference, deduction, or synthesis of information.\n*   **Unknown Contextual Understanding:** The model may not be able to understand context beyond the immediate sentence.\n*   **Fragility:** Without error cases, there is no way to assess the system's susceptibility to adversarial examples, typos, or changes in phrasing.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Reasoning**. Enhancing the system's ability to perform complex reasoning tasks will unlock significant improvements in its overall performance and applicability to more challenging real-world problems. This includes:\n\n1.  **Multi-step Reasoning:** Combining information from multiple sources or performing a series of logical steps to arrive at a conclusion.\n2.  **Inference:** Drawing conclusions that are not explicitly stated in the text.\n3.  **Deduction:** Applying general rules to specific cases.\n4.  **Synthesis:** Combining information from multiple sources to create a new understanding.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Prioritize Error Case Generation:** Invest significant effort in creating a diverse and challenging set of error cases. These should target specific reasoning capabilities (e.g., multi-hop reasoning, constraint satisfaction, dealing with ambiguous language, adversarial inputs) and edge cases.\n2.  **Implement Error Case Categorization:** For each error case, categorize the type of reasoning failure observed (e.g., incorrect entity extraction, failure to identify relevant information, flawed deduction). This will facilitate targeted improvement efforts.\n3.  **Integrate Reasoning Tracing:** Implement a mechanism for tracing the reasoning steps taken by the system. This could involve logging intermediate outputs, such as extracted entities, applied rules, or generated hypotheses. This will enable more granular analysis of where errors occur.\n4.  **Expand Training Data:** Augment the training data with examples that require more complex reasoning skills. This could involve using synthetic data generation techniques or curating existing datasets that focus on reasoning tasks.\n5.  **Consider a Hybrid Approach:** Explore hybrid AI architectures that combine the strengths of different techniques, such as neural networks for pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning for logical deduction.\n6.  **Prompt Engineering for Reasoning:** Experiment with prompt engineering techniques that guide the model towards performing more complex reasoning steps. For example, explicitly instruct the model to \"identify all relevant facts,\" \"draw inferences based on these facts,\" and \"provide a step-by-step explanation of your reasoning.\"\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the lack of error cases and the limited scope of the provided samples, it's impossible to accurately assess the capability trend. The accuracy score suggests that the system performs well on the specific test cases it was evaluated on. However, without a more comprehensive evaluation, it's impossible to determine whether capabilities are improving, declining, or stable in a broader sense. After completing the above actionable recommendations, this can be re-assessed.\n",

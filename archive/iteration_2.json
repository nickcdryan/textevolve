  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by iteratively extracting details, validating them, generating candidate times, and checking constraints. `main` orchestrates the process, calling `extract_meeting_details` to get initial details, `validate_meeting_details` to correct them, `generate_candidate_times` to create possible times, and `check_constraints` to find available slots. The LLM agent is used in both `extract_meeting_details` and `validate_meeting_details` functions with the `call_llm` function which calls the Gemini model. The functions `generate_candidate_times` and `check_constraints` use Python and string processing to implement some functionality.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThe predominant runtime error across all samples is:\n\n`ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'half'`\n\nThis error arises in the `generate_candidate_times` function within the `current_script_2.py` file. Specifically, the code attempts to convert the string \"half\" into an integer when determining the meeting duration in minutes. This indicates a failure in handling the case where the meeting duration is specified as \"half an hour\".\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  The system attempts to extract details and generate candidate times, demonstrating a structured approach to the scheduling problem.\n2.  The system architecture involves modular functions like `generate_candidate_times`, suggesting a reasonable attempt at code organization.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Poor Input Validation:** The system fails to properly validate the meeting duration string before attempting to convert it to an integer. This results in a `ValueError` when encountering \"half\".\n2.  **Brittle Parsing:** The code relies on splitting the duration string by spaces and assuming the first element is always an integer representing minutes, a very brittle approach.\n3.  **Lack of Error Handling:** There is no explicit error handling around the `int()` conversion, causing the program to crash instead of gracefully handling the \"half an hour\" case.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Incorrect Duration Parsing:** The system's inability to parse \"half an hour\" into a numerical representation of minutes is the primary bottleneck. This prevents the system from generating any valid candidate meeting times.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe error pattern is consistent: The system encounters the phrase \"half an hour\" in the input question, attempts to convert \"half\" to an integer, and throws a `ValueError`. This shows a consistent failure to handle non-integer duration specifications.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the inflexible and error-prone method used to determine the meeting duration in `generate_candidate_times`. The code assumes the duration will always be provided as a numerical value representing minutes and fails to handle the common case where the duration is specified as \"half an hour.\"\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Robust Input Parsing:** Improve the parsing logic in `generate_candidate_times` to correctly handle duration specifications like \"half an hour,\" \"15 minutes,\" \"45 minutes,\" etc.\n2.  **Error Handling:** Implement error handling around the `int()` conversion in `generate_candidate_times` to gracefully handle cases where the duration string cannot be directly converted to an integer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Modify `generate_candidate_times` to handle \"half an hour\":**\n    *   Add a conditional check for the word \"half\" in the duration string. If present, assign a duration of 30 minutes.\n    *   Consider using a dictionary or a more sophisticated parsing technique to map natural language duration phrases to their corresponding numerical values in minutes.\n\n    ```python\n    def generate_candidate_times(validated_details):\n        duration = validated_details[\"duration\"]\n        if \"half\" in duration:\n            duration_minutes = 30\n        else:\n            try:\n                duration_minutes = int(duration.split(\" \")[0])\n            except ValueError:\n                print(f\"Error: Could not parse duration: {duration}\")\n                return [] # Or raise a more specific exception\n\n        # ... rest of the function\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement a more robust duration parsing function:** Create a separate function that uses regular expressions or natural language processing techniques to accurately extract the meeting duration in minutes from the input string, handling various formats (e.g., \"30 minutes\", \"half an hour\", \"1 hour\", \"1.5 hours\").\n\n3.  **Add Unit Tests:** Write unit tests specifically to test the duration parsing logic with various input strings, including \"half an hour,\" \"15 minutes,\" and other common duration formats.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\nFor all samples (0-4), the following capability failed:\n\n*   **information_extraction:** While the system extracts *some* information, it fails to correctly extract the duration when specified as \"half an hour.\" This spills over to impact other modules of the program.\n*   **constraint_handling:** Since the duration is not parsed correctly, the system is not able to apply the duration constraint when generating possible meeting times.\n",

This confirms the error analysis: the system crashes whenever it encounters \"half an hour\" due to the failed `int()` conversion. The stack trace clearly points to line 128 in `current_script_2.py` within the `generate_candidate_times` function as the source of the error. This highlights a complete inability to process duration specifications like \"half an hour,\" preventing the system from progressing beyond this point. The repetition of the same error across all samples indicates a systemic flaw in the code's design rather than isolated incidents.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a very limited capability in scheduling meetings. While it attempts to extract details and generate candidate times, its core functionality is broken due to the duration parsing error. The system effectively fails on all test cases because of its inability to handle a common input format. Therefore, the system's overall capability is currently assessed as non-functional for a significant range of realistic inputs.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Approach:** The system follows a structured approach to solving the scheduling problem, attempting to extract relevant details and generate candidate times. This is a positive foundation to build upon.\n*   **Modular Design:** The architecture of the system with functions like `generate_candidate_times` suggests a reasonable attempt at code organization. This makes specific debugging and improvements more approachable.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inflexible Input Parsing:** The system relies on brittle string manipulation and regex patterns, which is prone to errors and breaks easily when the input deviates from expected formats. It is unable to handle variations in the description of the duration, leading to an inability to convert from human-readable to machine-understandable formats.\n*   **Insufficient Error Handling:** Lack of error handling around the problematic `int()` conversion leads to program crashes, preventing any meaningful error recovery or alternative processing paths.\n*   **Lack of LLM Integration:** The system uses very minimal LLM prompting. The system does not utilize the LLM to reason about the time, nor generate appropriate Python code to assist with the calculations, leading to the aforementioned brittle code.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **robust input parsing**, specifically for handling various duration specifications. This fix will directly address the identified bottleneck and unlock the system's ability to process a wider range of meeting scheduling requests. A move towards LLM reasoning to identify edge cases is ideal.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement duration parsing with LLM reasoning in `generate_candidate_times`:** Modify the system to use LLM to intelligently extract the duration and convert it into minutes. This should be prioritized as the main method of extracting the duration. The LLM can identify cases that would otherwise be edge cases.\n\n```python\ndef generate_candidate_times(validated_details):\n    duration = validated_details[\"duration\"]\n    # Use LLM to extract the duration in minutes\n    llm_prompt = f\"Extract the duration of the meeting (in minutes) from the following text: {duration}. If the duration cannot be determined return -1\"\n    duration_minutes = call_llm(llm_prompt)\n\n    try:\n        duration_minutes = int(duration_minutes)\n    except:\n        # Catch parsing issues if the LLM is bad at returning numbers\n        return []\n\n    if duration_minutes < 0:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not parse duration: {duration}\")\n        return [] # Or raise a more specific exception\n\n    # ... rest of the function\n```\n\n2.  **Add comprehensive unit tests:**  Create a comprehensive set of unit tests that cover a wide range of duration formats (e.g., \"half an hour\", \"15 minutes\", \"1 hour\", \"1.5 hours\", \"30 mins\", \"45min\") and any edge cases the LLM would otherwise not detect.\n3.  **Increase diversity of few-shot examples:** The current LLM calls are too simple to assist with the reasoning. Expand on the few-shot examples for the LLM to reason about edge cases, and use the LLM to reason about the structure of the program.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the system's capabilities are stable but essentially non-functional due to the consistent error. Once the duration parsing issue is addressed, the system's capabilities should show a significant improvement. Focusing on incorporating LLM reasoning, as well as better test cases are ideal for improving capability trends.\n```",

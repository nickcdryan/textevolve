  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach with example-driven reasoning to answer questions, incorporating question analysis, information extraction, answer generation, and verification. The problem is decomposed into four main steps: analyzing the question, extracting a relevant passage, generating an answer, and verifying the answer, each handled by a separate function. There are no agent roles indicated in the script. The script uses `analyze_question` to identify the question type and keywords, `extract_relevant_passage` to find the relevant information, `generate_answer` to form an answer, `verify_answer` to confirm its correctness, and `call_llm` to interface with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves analyzing the question, extracting relevant information, generating an initial answer, verifying it for accuracy, and then returning the verified answer.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West divisional rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212; from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212; from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

Tennessee would trail early in the first quarter as Bills running back Fred Jackson threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans.  The Titans would respond as running back Chris Johnson got a 28-yard touchdown run, followed by quarterback Vince Young hooking up with wide receiver Nate Washington on a 14-yard touchdown pass.

The second voyage to India was dispatched in 1500 under Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral. While following the same south-westerly route as Gama across the Atlantic Ocean, Cabral made landfall on the Brazilian coast. This was probably an accidental discovery, but it has been speculated that the Portuguese secretly knew of Brazil's existence and that it lay on their side of the Tordesillas line. Cabral recommended to the Portuguese King that the land be settled, and two follow up voyages were sent in 1501 and 1503. The land was found to be abundant in pau-brasil, or brazilwood, from which it later inherited its name, but the failure to find gold or silver meant that for the time being Portuguese efforts were concentrated on India. On 8 July 1497 the fleet, consisting of four ships and a crew of 170 men, left Lisbon The travel led by Vasco da Gama to Calicut was the starting point for deployment of Portuguese in the African east coast and in the Indian Ocean. The first contact occurred on 20 May 1498. After some conflict, he got an ambiguous letter for trade with the Zamorin of Calicut, leaving there some men to establish a trading post. Since then explorations lost the private nature, taking place under the exclusive of the Portuguese Crown. Shortly after, the Casa da \u00cdndia was established in Lisbon to administer the royal monopoly of navigation and trade.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment of your AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis report (or lack thereof), and sample execution outputs you've provided.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs show a consistent pattern of identifying and extracting the correct answer. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are used to delimit the answer, and in the provided examples, they accurately encapsulate the desired information.  There are no obvious formatting or structural issues within the outputs. However, since we only see positive examples, we can't assess the system's robustness when it *doesn't* find an answer, or finds a partial or incorrect answer.  Does it gracefully handle \"not found\" scenarios? Does it provide any confidence scores associated with its extractions?  These remain unanswered.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a high level of accuracy (100%) on the provided samples, indicating strong proficiency in information extraction and question answering *within the tested domain*. The sample execution outputs confirm its ability to locate and isolate the correct answer within the given context.  However, the absence of error cases severely limits our ability to provide a truly comprehensive assessment. We can't gauge its robustness, its sensitivity to variations in input phrasing, or its ability to handle edge cases or adversarial examples. Based on the limited data, it appears to be functioning correctly within the scope of the test data.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accurate Information Extraction:** The system excels at accurately identifying and extracting the correct answer from the provided text.\n*   **Precise Answer Delimitation:** The use of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags allows for clear and unambiguous identification of the answer.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Error Handling Visibility:**  We don't know how the system behaves when it *cannot* find an answer.  Does it return an error message?  Does it time out?  Does it hallucinate an answer?\n*   **Domain Specificity Uncertainty:** The limited data makes it impossible to determine how well the system generalizes to different types of questions or texts. It may be heavily optimized for the specific questions it was given.\n*   **No Error Data for Targeted Improvement:** We cannot identify specific areas for improvement without examples of the system failing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **robustness and error handling**. This means designing the system to gracefully handle situations where it cannot find a definitive answer and to provide informative feedback in such cases.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Develop a Comprehensive Error Case Test Suite:**  Create a diverse set of test cases that intentionally trigger failures.  These should include:\n    *   Questions with ambiguous wording.\n    *   Questions that require inference beyond simple extraction.\n    *   Questions where the answer is not explicitly stated in the text.\n    *   Questions with multiple possible answers.\n    *   Questions that are factually incorrect or nonsensical.\n    *   Input text with errors, typos, and variations in phrasing.\n2.  **Implement \"No Answer\" Handling:** Modify the system to explicitly handle cases where it cannot find an answer.  Instead of returning nothing (or hallucinating an answer), it should return a structured \"no answer\" response, possibly including a confidence score indicating the likelihood of an answer being present.  Example: `{\"answer\": null, \"confidence\": 0.1}`.\n3.  **Implement Logging and Monitoring:** Add detailed logging to track the system's execution path, the data it extracts, and its decision-making process. This will make it easier to diagnose the root cause of errors. Log variable values for debugging.\n4.  **Confidence Score Evaluation:** For existing correct extractions, implement a confidence score for each answer. This allows evaluation of whether the system's confidence is aligned with its accuracy and to monitor calibration.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, the capabilities appear *stable* within the tested domain. However, we have no way of knowing if the system is improving, declining, or plateauing in terms of its overall performance without a more comprehensive test suite and error analysis.  It's essentially a black box that performs well on the small set of tasks we've seen.\n",

This could involve techniques like chain-of-thought prompting or explicitly breaking down questions into smaller sub-problems.\n*   **Ambiguity Resolution:** Improve the system's ability to handle ambiguous questions or passages, perhaps by generating multiple interpretations and evaluating them against the context.\n*   **External Knowledge Integration:** Explore integrating external knowledge sources (e.g., knowledge graphs, databases) to supplement the information provided in the passage.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning:** Add more robust numerical reasoning capabilities, including unit conversion, proportional reasoning, and handling ranges of values.\n*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Explicitly model constraints within the problem and ensure that the generated solutions adhere to them.\n*   **Error Handling & Logging:** Implement more detailed error logging and tracing to diagnose and debug failures more effectively. Use of print statements during the operation to determine values of variables at particular steps.\n*   **Test Suite Expansion:** Develop a more comprehensive and diverse test suite, including challenging edge cases and adversarial examples.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nSince there are no error cases, capability mapping is not possible.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment of your AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis report (or lack thereof), and sample execution outputs you've provided.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs show a consistent pattern of identifying and extracting the correct answer. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are used to delimit the answer, and in the provided examples, they accurately encapsulate the desired information.  There are no obvious formatting or structural issues within the outputs. However, since we only see positive examples, we can't assess the system's robustness when it *doesn't* find an answer, or finds a partial or incorrect answer.  Does it gracefully handle \"not found\" scenarios? Does it provide any confidence scores associated with its extractions?  These remain unanswered.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a high level of accuracy (100%) on the provided samples, indicating strong proficiency in information extraction and question answering *within the tested domain*. The sample execution outputs confirm its ability to locate and isolate the correct answer within the given context.  However, the absence of error cases severely limits our ability to provide a truly comprehensive assessment. We can't gauge its robustness, its sensitivity to variations in input phrasing, or its ability to handle edge cases or adversarial examples. Based on the limited data, it appears to be functioning correctly within the scope of the test data.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accurate Information Extraction:** The system excels at accurately identifying and extracting the correct answer from the provided text.\n*   **Precise Answer Delimitation:** The use of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags allows for clear and unambiguous identification of the answer.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Error Handling Visibility:**  We don't know how the system behaves when it *cannot* find an answer.  Does it return an error message?  Does it time out?  Does it hallucinate an answer?\n*   **Domain Specificity Uncertainty:** The limited data makes it impossible to determine how well the system generalizes to different types of questions or texts. It may be heavily optimized for the specific questions it was given.\n*   **No Error Data for Targeted Improvement:** We cannot identify specific areas for improvement without examples of the system failing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **robustness and error handling**. This means designing the system to gracefully handle situations where it cannot find a definitive answer and to provide informative feedback in such cases.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Develop a Comprehensive Error Case Test Suite:**  Create a diverse set of test cases that intentionally trigger failures.  These should include:\n    *   Questions with ambiguous wording.\n    *   Questions that require inference beyond simple extraction.\n    *   Questions where the answer is not explicitly stated in the text.\n    *   Questions with multiple possible answers.\n    *   Questions that are factually incorrect or nonsensical.\n    *   Input text with errors, typos, and variations in phrasing.\n2.  **Implement \"No Answer\" Handling:** Modify the system to explicitly handle cases where it cannot find an answer.  Instead of returning nothing (or hallucinating an answer), it should return a structured \"no answer\" response, possibly including a confidence score indicating the likelihood of an answer being present.  Example: `{\"answer\": null, \"confidence\": 0.1}`.\n3.  **Implement Logging and Monitoring:** Add detailed logging to track the system's execution path, the data it extracts, and its decision-making process. This will make it easier to diagnose the root cause of errors. Log variable values for debugging.\n4.  **Confidence Score Evaluation:** For existing correct extractions, implement a confidence score for each answer. This allows evaluation of whether the system's confidence is aligned with its accuracy and to monitor calibration.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, the capabilities appear *stable* within the tested domain. However, we have no way of knowing if the system is improving, declining, or plateauing in terms of its overall performance without a more comprehensive test suite and error analysis.  It's essentially a black box that performs well on the small set of tasks we've seen.\n"

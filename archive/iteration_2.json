  "approach_summary": "The script implements a knowledge graph approach to answer questions using supporting documents by leveraging the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into knowledge extraction and reasoning, assigning the LLM the roles of knowledge extraction expert and question answering system. The `extract_knowledge` function extracts entities and relationships, validates the format of the extracted knowledge, and returns the knowledge in JSON format, calling `call_llm` to generate and validate the knowledge, while `reason_over_knowledge` generates the final answer based on the extracted knowledge, using `call_llm` to generate the answer. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling the other functions and iterating through the supporting documents to generate an answer.",

It was the first journal devoted exclusively to Celtic languages and literature and the oldest significant journal of Celtic studies still in existence today. The emphasis is on (early) Irish language and literature and Continental Celtic languages, but other aspects of Celtic philology and literature (including modern literature) also receive attention. \n\n=== Document 2: Insular Celtic languages ===\nInsular Celtic languages are a group of Celtic languages that originated in Britain and Ireland, in contrast to the Continental Celtic languages of mainland Europe and Anatolia. All surviving Celtic languages are from the Insular Celtic group, including that which is now spoken in Continental Europe; the Continental Celtic languages are extinct. The six Insular Celtic languages of modern times can be divided into: \n\n=== Document 3: Alexei Kondratiev ===\nAlexei Kondratiev (1949\u20132010) was an American author, linguist, and teacher of Celtic languages, folklore and culture. He taught the Irish language and Celtic history at the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan, New York from 1985 until his death on May 28, 2010. Nine editions of his book, \"The Apple Branch\", were published in English and Spanish between 1998 and 2004. At various times, he taught all six of the living Celtic languages. \n\n=== Document 4: Celtic studies ===\nCeltic studies or Celtology is the academic discipline occupied with the study of any sort of cultural output relating to the Celtic people. This ranges from linguistics, literature and art history, archaeology and history, the focus lying on the study of the various Celtic languages, living and extinct. The primary areas of focus are the six Celtic languages currently in use: Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. \n\n=== Document 5: Continental Celtic languages ===\nThe Continental Celtic languages are the Celtic languages, now extinct, that were spoken on the continent of Europe, as distinguished from the Insular Celtic languages of the British Isles and Brittany. \"Continental Celtic\" is a geographic, not a linguistic, grouping of the ancient Celtic languages. The Continental Celtic languages were spoken by the people known to Roman and Greek writers as \"Keltoi\", \"Celtae\", \"Galli\" and \"Galatae\". These languages were spoken in an arc stretching across from Iberia in the west to the Balkans and Anatolia in the east. \n\n=== Document 6: Celtic nations ===\nThe Celtic nations are territories in western Europe where Celtic languages or cultural traits have survived. The term \"nation\" is used in its original sense to mean a people who share a common identity and culture and are identified with a traditional territory. \n\n=== Document 7: Journal of Celtic Linguistics ===\nThe Journal of Celtic Linguistics is a peer-reviewed annual academic journal established in 1992 with the goal of encouraging and publishing original linguistic research in the Celtic languages. The journal is published by the University of Wales Press, but has specialist editors in all six Celtic languages.

The region is inhabited by societies that share many cultural traits but whose languages are characterized by great diversity. There are about 330 extant languages in Greater Amazonia, almost half of which have fewer than 500 speakers. Meanwhile, only Guajiro has a six-digit number of speakers (about 300,000). Of the 330 total languages, about fifty are isolates, while the remaining ones belong to about 25 different families. Most of the posited families have few members. It is this distribution of many small and historically unrelated speech communities that makes Amazonia one of the most linguistically diverse regions in the world. The precise reasons for this unusual diversity have not yet been conclusively determined, but it is noteworthy that Amazonian languages seem to have had fewer than 10,000 native speakers even before the invasion of European colonists wrought havoc on the societies by which they were spoken. Despite the large-scale diversity, the long-term contact among many of the languages of Greater Amazonia has created similarities between many neighboring languages that are not genetically related. The small tribes can speak English but that would be used as one of their secondary languages \n\n=== Document 9: Celtic art ===\nCeltic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages. \n\n=== Document 10: Pan Celtic Festival ===\nThe Pan Celtic Festival (Irish: \"F\u00e9ile Pan Cheilteach\" ) is a Celtic-language music festival held annually in the week following Easter, since its inauguration in 1971.

(Most sources show music and lyrics by both, but Cochran was a lyricist and Grant a composer.) The melody was adapted from the operatic aria, \"\"Caro nome,\"\" from the opera \"Rigoletto\" by Giuseppe Verdi. \n\n=== Document 2: Beautiful Young Minds ===\nBeautiful Young Minds was a documentary first shown at the BRITDOC Festival on 26 July 2007 and first broadcast on BBC 2 on 14 October 2007. The documentary follows the selection process and training for the U.K. team to compete in the 2006 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), as well as the actual event in Slovenia. Many of the young mathematicians featured in the film had a form of autism, which the documentary links to mathematical ability. The team goes on to win numerous medals at the IMO, including four silver and one bronze. It was directed by Morgan Matthews, edited by Joby Gee and featured music by Sam Hooper. It was also screened at the Bath Film Festival in October 2007. The documentary inspired the 2014 film X+Y, which was also directed by Morgan Matthews, based on IMO participant Daniel Lightwing. \n\n=== Document 3: Joby Talbot ===\nJoby Talbot (born 25 August 1971) is a British composer. He has written for a wide variety of purposes and an accordingly broad range of styles, including instrumental and vocal concert music, film and television scores, pop arrangements and works for dance. He is therefore known to sometimes disparate audiences for quite different works. \n\n=== Document 4: Robin Hood (2018 film) ===\nRobin Hood is an upcoming American action-adventure film directed by Otto Bathurst and written by Joby Harold, Peter Craig, and David James Kelly based on the tale of Robin Hood.

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error across all error cases is:\n\n```\nTypeError: main() missing 1 required positional argument: 'supporting_documents'\n```\n\nThis indicates a fundamental problem with how the `main()` function is being called within the `test_script_2.py` script.  The function is designed to accept both the `question` and `supporting_documents` as arguments, but it is only being called with the `question`.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the lack of successful cases and the nature of the errors, it's difficult to identify strengths of the reasoning approach. However, the fact that the error is consistently a `TypeError` suggests the script's error handling is capable of identifying and reporting basic argument-related problems.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1. **Incorrect Function Call:** The primary weakness is the incorrect calling of the `main()` function in the testing script. It's missing the crucial `supporting_documents` argument.\n2. **Lack of Core Reasoning Functionality:** Since all cases fail due to the same basic error, it's impossible to assess the actual reasoning capabilities of the system.  It suggests the core logic isn't even being executed.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\nThe single critical bottleneck is the failure to pass the `supporting_documents` to the `main()` function. This prevents any actual problem-solving logic from being executed.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe error pattern is consistent: `TypeError: main() missing 1 required positional argument: 'supporting_documents'`. This indicates a systemic issue in the testing setup rather than a problem with individual data samples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the incorrect invocation of the `main()` function within the `test_script_2.py` script.  The `supporting_documents` argument is not being passed, leading to a `TypeError`.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1. **Testing Script Correction:**  The testing script (`test_script_2.py`) MUST be corrected to properly pass both the `question` and `supporting_documents` arguments to the `main()` function.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Modify `test_script_2.py`:**  Specifically, the line where `answer = module.main(question)` is called needs to be changed to `answer = module.main(question, supporting_documents)`. The exact variable name for supporting documents would depend on how it is stored, but the principle is that the `supporting_documents` are not being passed into the model.\n2. **Add Unit Tests:**  Introduce unit tests to verify the correct signature and argument handling of the `main()` function *before* attempting integration tests with complex data. This will catch this type of error much earlier.\n3. **Debugging Prints:** Temporarily add `print` statements at the beginning of the `main()` function to confirm the arguments are being received correctly during testing.  This helps to immediately identify argument-related issues. For example:\n   ```python\n   def main(question, supporting_documents):\n       print(f\"Question received: {question}\")\n       print(f\"Number of supporting documents: {len(supporting_documents)}\")\n       # ... rest of the function logic ...\n   ```\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nFor all samples (0-4), the following capabilities failed because the `main()` function was never properly executed:\n\n- information_extraction\n- constraint_handling\n- solution_generation\n- solution_verification\n- decision_making\n",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nBased on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and capability mapping, here's a thorough capability assessment:\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs consistently show a `TypeError` indicating that the `main()` function is being called without the required `supporting_documents` argument. This is a critical error occurring at the entry point of the system, preventing any further execution or evaluation of the core reasoning capabilities. The traceback pinpoints the exact line in `test_script_2.py` where the error originates, making it easily diagnosable. The uniformity of the error across all samples suggests a systemic issue within the testing framework, rather than a problem with specific data instances.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nAt present, the AI system demonstrates *no demonstrable capabilities* beyond basic error reporting. The failure to correctly invoke the `main()` function means that no capabilities related to information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, verification, or decision-making can be assessed. The system's ability to flag a `TypeError` is a very minor positive, but is overshadowed by the fundamental execution failure.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Error Detection:** The system successfully identifies and reports a `TypeError` when the `main()` function is called with incorrect arguments. This indicates a basic level of error handling.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Function Call Error:** The primary and most critical weakness is the failure to correctly call the `main()` function with all required arguments in the testing script.\n*   **Lack of Reasoning Capabilities Demonstration:** Due to the execution error, the system's core reasoning capabilities remain entirely unverified and cannot be evaluated.\n*   **Testing Setup Issue:** The root cause is not in the AI logic itself but in the testing environment setup.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is establishing a *functional testing environment*. Specifically, ensuring the correct invocation of the `main()` function is paramount. Until this is resolved, no other capability improvement is possible.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Correct `test_script_2.py`:**\n    *   Modify the line in `test_script_2.py` that calls the `main()` function. Change `answer = module.main(question)` to `answer = module.main(question, supporting_documents)`. Ensure `supporting_documents` is properly populated with the relevant data. The exact implementation will depend on the structure of the data, but the critical point is the inclusion of the missing argument.  If `supporting_documents` is a global or accessible variable in the testing script, verify its contents before passing to `main()`. If not, it needs to be passed from a data source (e.g., loaded from a file).\n2.  **Implement Unit Tests:**\n    *   Introduce unit tests specifically designed to verify the signature and argument handling of the `main()` function. These tests should be independent of the full integration tests and focus solely on ensuring the function receives the correct arguments. This will catch similar errors *before* they impact the entire testing process. For example, use `unittest` framework to assert that calling `main()` with one argument raises a `TypeError`.\n3.  **Add Argument Validation and Debugging Prints:**\n    *   Within the `main()` function, add assertions to validate that both `question` and `supporting_documents` arguments are of the expected types.\n    *   Add `print` statements at the beginning of the `main()` function to log the values of `question` and `supporting_documents` (or the number of supporting documents if it's a large dataset). For example:\n        ```python\n        def main(question, supporting_documents):\n            print(f\"Question received: {question}\")\n            print(f\"Number of supporting documents: {len(supporting_documents)}\")\n            assert isinstance(question, str), \"Question must be a string\"\n            assert isinstance(supporting_documents, list), \"Supporting documents must be a list\"\n            # ... rest of the function logic ...\n        ```\n4.  **Review Testing Data Pipeline:**\n    *   Examine the entire data pipeline used in `test_script_2.py` to ensure that the `supporting_documents` are correctly loaded, pre-processed, and made available to the `main()` function.  It is possible the data loading process is incomplete.\n5.  **Simplify Testing:**\n    * Temporarily create a very simple test case with hardcoded `question` and `supporting_documents` inside the `test_script_2.py` to verify the fix.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error across all error cases is:\n\n```\nTypeError: main() missing 1 required positional argument: 'supporting_documents'\n```\n\nThis indicates a fundamental problem with how the `main()` function is being called within the `test_script_2.py` script.  The function is designed to accept both the `question` and `supporting_documents` as arguments, but it is only being called with the `question`.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the lack of successful cases and the nature of the errors, it's difficult to identify strengths of the reasoning approach. However, the fact that the error is consistently a `TypeError` suggests the script's error handling is capable of identifying and reporting basic argument-related problems.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1. **Incorrect Function Call:** The primary weakness is the incorrect calling of the `main()` function in the testing script. It's missing the crucial `supporting_documents` argument.\n2. **Lack of Core Reasoning Functionality:** Since all cases fail due to the same basic error, it's impossible to assess the actual reasoning capabilities of the system.  It suggests the core logic isn't even being executed.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\nThe single critical bottleneck is the failure to pass the `supporting_documents` to the `main()` function. This prevents any actual problem-solving logic from being executed.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe error pattern is consistent: `TypeError: main() missing 1 required positional argument: 'supporting_documents'`. This indicates a systemic issue in the testing setup rather than a problem with individual data samples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the incorrect invocation of the `main()` function within the `test_script_2.py` script.  The `supporting_documents` argument is not being passed, leading to a `TypeError`.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1. **Testing Script Correction:**  The testing script (`test_script_2.py`) MUST be corrected to properly pass both the `question` and `supporting_documents` arguments to the `main()` function.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Modify `test_script_2.py`:**  Specifically, the line where `answer = module.main(question)` is called needs to be changed to `answer = module.main(question, supporting_documents)`. The exact variable name for supporting documents would depend on how it is stored, but the principle is that the `supporting_documents` are not being passed into the model.\n2. **Add Unit Tests:**  Introduce unit tests to verify the correct signature and argument handling of the `main()` function *before* attempting integration tests with complex data. This will catch this type of error much earlier.\n3. **Debugging Prints:** Temporarily add `print` statements at the beginning of the `main()` function to confirm the arguments are being received correctly during testing.  This helps to immediately identify argument-related issues. For example:\n   ```python\n   def main(question, supporting_documents):\n       print(f\"Question received: {question}\")\n       print(f\"Number of supporting documents: {len(supporting_documents)}\")\n       # ... rest of the function logic ...\n   ```\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nFor all samples (0-4), the following capabilities failed because the `main()` function was never properly executed:\n\n- information_extraction\n- constraint_handling\n- solution_generation\n- solution_verification\n- decision_making\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nBased on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and capability mapping, here's a thorough capability assessment:\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs consistently show a `TypeError` indicating that the `main()` function is being called without the required `supporting_documents` argument. This is a critical error occurring at the entry point of the system, preventing any further execution or evaluation of the core reasoning capabilities. The traceback pinpoints the exact line in `test_script_2.py` where the error originates, making it easily diagnosable. The uniformity of the error across all samples suggests a systemic issue within the testing framework, rather than a problem with specific data instances.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nAt present, the AI system demonstrates *no demonstrable capabilities* beyond basic error reporting. The failure to correctly invoke the `main()` function means that no capabilities related to information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, verification, or decision-making can be assessed. The system's ability to flag a `TypeError` is a very minor positive, but is overshadowed by the fundamental execution failure.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Error Detection:** The system successfully identifies and reports a `TypeError` when the `main()` function is called with incorrect arguments. This indicates a basic level of error handling.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Function Call Error:** The primary and most critical weakness is the failure to correctly call the `main()` function with all required arguments in the testing script.\n*   **Lack of Reasoning Capabilities Demonstration:** Due to the execution error, the system's core reasoning capabilities remain entirely unverified and cannot be evaluated.\n*   **Testing Setup Issue:** The root cause is not in the AI logic itself but in the testing environment setup.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is establishing a *functional testing environment*. Specifically, ensuring the correct invocation of the `main()` function is paramount. Until this is resolved, no other capability improvement is possible.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Correct `test_script_2.py`:**\n    *   Modify the line in `test_script_2.py` that calls the `main()` function. Change `answer = module.main(question)` to `answer = module.main(question, supporting_documents)`. Ensure `supporting_documents` is properly populated with the relevant data. The exact implementation will depend on the structure of the data, but the critical point is the inclusion of the missing argument.  If `supporting_documents` is a global or accessible variable in the testing script, verify its contents before passing to `main()`. If not, it needs to be passed from a data source (e.g., loaded from a file).\n2.  **Implement Unit Tests:**\n    *   Introduce unit tests specifically designed to verify the signature and argument handling of the `main()` function. These tests should be independent of the full integration tests and focus solely on ensuring the function receives the correct arguments. This will catch similar errors *before* they impact the entire testing process. For example, use `unittest` framework to assert that calling `main()` with one argument raises a `TypeError`.\n3.  **Add Argument Validation and Debugging Prints:**\n    *   Within the `main()` function, add assertions to validate that both `question` and `supporting_documents` arguments are of the expected types.\n    *   Add `print` statements at the beginning of the `main()` function to log the values of `question` and `supporting_documents` (or the number of supporting documents if it's a large dataset). For example:\n        ```python\n        def main(question, supporting_documents):\n            print(f\"Question received: {question}\")\n            print(f\"Number of supporting documents: {len(supporting_documents)}\")\n            assert isinstance(question, str), \"Question must be a string\"\n            assert isinstance(supporting_documents, list), \"Supporting documents must be a list\"\n            # ... rest of the function logic ...\n        ```\n4.  **Review Testing Data Pipeline:**\n    *   Examine the entire data pipeline used in `test_script_2.py` to ensure that the `supporting_documents` are correctly loaded, pre-processed, and made available to the `main()` function.  It is possible the data loading process is incomplete.\n5.  **Simplify Testing:**\n    * Temporarily create a very simple test case with hardcoded `question` and `supporting_documents` inside the `test_script_2.py` to verify the fix. This isolates the problem and eliminates external data dependencies.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is *stable, at zero*. No progress can be made until the testing environment is corrected. Once the `main()` function is called correctly, then a more accurate assessment of the underlying AI system's capabilities can be performed, and a trend established.\n"

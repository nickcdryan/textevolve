  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting meeting data using `extract_meeting_data`, which uses an LLM with few-shot examples and a verification loop to ensure accuracy. Then, `find_available_slots` uses another LLM call with embedded examples to identify suitable time slots based on the extracted information. The `call_llm` function is used to interface with the LLM, passing prompts and system instructions. The main workflow involves extracting structured data, finding available slots, and presenting the proposed time.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several key issues:\n\n*   **Multiple Answers:** The most prominent issue is the generation of multiple possible time slots as the final answer (Sample ID 1). This directly contradicts the requirement for a *single*, *best* solution. The system does the complex task of schedule comparison correctly, but fails on decision making.\n*   **Redundant Text:** Sample ID 1 contains repetitive and redundant text in its output. It repeats the entire reasoning process and available slots section in the \"Final Answer\". This suggests an issue with how the final answer is being constructed, potentially including extraneous information.\n*   **Incomplete Solution Generation**: Not all samples provide a complete and correct solution. Even though the information extraction is correct, it needs to better generate the constraints it imposes on the schedule.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates moderate capabilities in information extraction and constraint analysis. However, its decision-making and solution verification capabilities are significantly lacking, leading to inaccurate or incomplete results. The system extracts information well, but the reasoning to produce the *best* final answer is flawed, or at least is not being properly implemented.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system consistently extracts relevant information (participants, schedules, duration, etc.) from the problem statement. This is a strong foundation to build upon.\n*   **Constraint Analysis:** The system demonstrates an ability to analyze participant schedules and identify potential time conflicts. It correctly identifies the constraints on the final solution.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Decision-Making (Prioritization & Selection):** The system struggles to prioritize constraints and select the single *best* time slot based on those priorities. It often presents multiple options or chooses an incorrect slot.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust mechanism to verify that its proposed solution is valid for all participants and satisfies all constraints.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The output format is sometimes inconsistent and contains redundant information, making it difficult to extract the final answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary improvement focus should be on **Decision-Making**. The system needs to be able to take the extracted information and identified constraints and produce a single, *optimal* solution. Without improving decision-making capabilities, the system will continue to produce multiple answers or incorrect selections, significantly impacting its overall accuracy.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Scoring Mechanism for Available Time Slots:**\n    *   Modify the system to assign scores to each potential time slot based on constraint satisfaction.\n    *   **Hard Constraints (Availability):** Assign a very high score (e.g., 100) if all participants are available. Assign 0 if even one participant is unavailable.\n    *   **Soft Constraints (Preferences):** Deduct points (e.g., 5-10) for each preference that is violated.\n    *   The slot with the highest overall score should be selected as the final answer.\n2.  **Add a Solution Verification Step with Explicit Checking:**\n    *   After selecting a potential time slot, add a dedicated verification step.\n    *   This step should explicitly check, for each participant, whether the selected slot conflicts with their schedule or violates any preferences.\n    *   If any conflicts are found, the solution should be rejected, and the scoring mechanism should be re-evaluated to choose a different slot.\n3.  **Refine the Prompt to Emphasize a Single, Best Solution and Remove Redundancy:**\n    *   Rewrite the prompt to explicitly state that the system must provide *only one* time slot as the final answer.\n    *   Add examples to the prompt demonstrating the desired output format: `\"Here is the proposed time: [Single Time Slot]\"`.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are present in the provided error cases. This suggests that the errors stem from logical reasoning failures rather than code execution issues.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n- The system is generally able to extract the relevant information from the problem statement, including participants, duration, days, work hours, and schedules.\n- The system attempts to analyze the available slots considering the extracted schedules and preferences.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n- The system often provides multiple possible time slots instead of selecting the single best option as indicated in the golden answer. This suggests a failure in the decision-making process.\n- The system sometimes fails to identify the correct available time slot, indicating issues with constraint handling or solution generation.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Decision-Making:** The system struggles to select the single best time slot that meets all constraints, often providing multiple options or choosing an incorrect one.\n- **Solution Verification:** The system doesn't seem to have a robust mechanism for verifying the final solution against all constraints to ensure correctness.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- The system frequently proposes multiple time slots instead of a single, definitive answer.\n- The system occasionally overlooks constraints, leading to incorrect time slot suggestions.\n- There's a disconnect between identifying available slots and selecting the *best* available slot, given preferences.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the system's inability to make a definitive decision on the *best* available time slot, leading to multiple answers or incorrect selections. This suggests a weakness in prioritizing constraints and preferences, ultimately affecting the decision-making capability.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Decision-Making:** Improve the decision-making process to select a single, optimal time slot based on all constraints and preferences.\n- **Solution Verification:** Implement a more robust solution verification mechanism to ensure the selected time slot is valid for all participants and satisfies all constraints.\n- **Constraint Handling:** Refine the system's ability to prioritize and apply constraints, especially participant preferences.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Implement a scoring mechanism for available time slots:** Assign scores based on constraint satisfaction (e.g., hard constraints like availability get high scores, preferences get lower scores). The slot with the highest score is selected.\n- **Add a solution verification step after slot selection:** Before returning the answer, explicitly check if the selected time slot works for all participants, considering all constraints. If not, re-evaluate the available slots.\n- **Refine the prompt to emphasize the need for a *single*, *best* solution:** Add examples to the prompt that clearly demonstrate the expected output format (i.e., a single time slot).\n- **Implement a \"best-of-n\" approach:** Generate multiple possible solutions, evaluate them based on constraint satisfaction, and select the best one.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample ID 0:** solution_generation, decision_making\n- **Sample ID 1:** decision_making\n- **Sample ID 2:** solution_generation, decision_making, solution_verification\n- **Sample ID 4:** solution_generation, decision_making, solution_verification\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several key issues:\n\n*   **Multiple Answers:** The most prominent issue is the generation of multiple possible time slots as the final answer (Sample ID 1). This directly contradicts the requirement for a *single*, *best* solution. The system does the complex task of schedule comparison correctly, but fails on decision making.\n*   **Redundant Text:** Sample ID 1 contains repetitive and redundant text in its output. It repeats the entire reasoning process and available slots section in the \"Final Answer\". This suggests an issue with how the final answer is being constructed, potentially including extraneous information.\n*   **Incomplete Solution Generation**: Not all samples provide a complete and correct solution. Even though the information extraction is correct, it needs to better generate the constraints it imposes on the schedule.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates moderate capabilities in information extraction and constraint analysis. However, its decision-making and solution verification capabilities are significantly lacking, leading to inaccurate or incomplete results. The system extracts information well, but the reasoning to produce the *best* final answer is flawed, or at least is not being properly implemented.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system consistently extracts relevant information (participants, schedules, duration, etc.) from the problem statement. This is a strong foundation to build upon.\n*   **Constraint Analysis:** The system demonstrates an ability to analyze participant schedules and identify potential time conflicts. It correctly identifies the constraints on the final solution.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Decision-Making (Prioritization & Selection):** The system struggles to prioritize constraints and select the single *best* time slot based on those priorities. It often presents multiple options or chooses an incorrect slot.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust mechanism to verify that its proposed solution is valid for all participants and satisfies all constraints.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The output format is sometimes inconsistent and contains redundant information, making it difficult to extract the final answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary improvement focus should be on **Decision-Making**. The system needs to be able to take the extracted information and identified constraints and produce a single, *optimal* solution. Without improving decision-making capabilities, the system will continue to produce multiple answers or incorrect selections, significantly impacting its overall accuracy.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Scoring Mechanism for Available Time Slots:**\n    *   Modify the system to assign scores to each potential time slot based on constraint satisfaction.\n    *   **Hard Constraints (Availability):** Assign a very high score (e.g., 100) if all participants are available. Assign 0 if even one participant is unavailable.\n    *   **Soft Constraints (Preferences):** Deduct points (e.g., 5-10) for each preference that is violated.\n    *   The slot with the highest overall score should be selected as the final answer.\n2.  **Add a Solution Verification Step with Explicit Checking:**\n    *   After selecting a potential time slot, add a dedicated verification step.\n    *   This step should explicitly check, for each participant, whether the selected slot conflicts with their schedule or violates any preferences.\n    *   If any conflicts are found, the solution should be rejected, and the scoring mechanism should be re-evaluated to choose a different slot.\n3.  **Refine the Prompt to Emphasize a Single, Best Solution and Remove Redundancy:**\n    *   Rewrite the prompt to explicitly state that the system must provide *only one* time slot as the final answer.\n    *   Add examples to the prompt demonstrating the desired output format: `\"Here is the proposed time: [Single Time Slot]\"`. Ensure the time slot is indeed a single time.\n    *   Remove instructions that encourage the system to output the entire reasoning process in the final answer. It should only output the final time slot. The system already extracts correctly, thus it should not restate.\n4.  **Implement Unit Tests for Schedule Parsing and Conflict Detection**\n    *   Create Python unit tests that independently assess the schedule parsing and conflict detection logic.\n    *   This ensures the fundamental schedule logic is working correctly, regardless of the specific LLM being used.\n    *   If schedules cannot be parsed, decision making is pointless.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nWith an accuracy of 0.20, the system is currently at a low level of capability. The current error patterns suggest fundamental issues in decision making and solution verification. Therefore, the trend is considered **stable but unsatisfactory**. The recommendations, if implemented successfully, should lead to a significant improvement in accuracy and a positive trend.\n"

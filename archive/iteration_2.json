It decomposes the problem into three steps: analyzing value relationships, inferring transformation logic, and applying the logic to generate the transformed grid. The LLM acts as an expert in grid transformations. The function `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process, using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API to generate text based on prompts. The `main` function is the entrypoint that calls `solve_grid_transformation` with the problem text.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and your requests.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The AI system currently demonstrates very limited capability in performing the specified grid transformation task. The system fails to accurately replicate patterns, generalize from training examples, or demonstrate spatial reasoning.  The system can generate the correct syntax of a python grid, but does not properly perform any of the expected actions, leading to an accuracy score of 0%.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The output attempts to replicate a pattern, but places numbers in incorrect locations. There is a slight relationship to what is expected, but is not valid. The pattern shown is found in the training data.\n*   **Sample 1:** The output shows a very distinct lack of any understanding, and replicates numbers in a row. It seems to take only 3 and 4 as being key parameters, and does not understand any complex understanding of input.\n*   **Sample 2:** The output shows a misunderstanding, and replicates a singular number across the whole grid, with no relation to the input.\n*   **Common Issues:**\n    *   **Incorrect Placement:** Values are placed in incorrect locations, indicating a lack of spatial awareness.\n    *   **Lack of Adaptation:**  The outputs don't adapt to the specific structure of the test input grids.\n    *   **Value hallucination:** The AI hallucinates what the correct values are, even if it has the correct pattern.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Syntactically Correct Output:**  Consistently generates valid Python code for a grid-like structure.\n*   **Format Recognition:** Identifies the required input/output format (grid-based matrix).\n*   **Basic Pattern Replication:** Shows an attempt to replicate patterns observed in the training data, indicating a rudimentary learning process.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:**  Inability to generalize patterns from training data to new input grids. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:**  Poor understanding of spatial relationships and applying transformations based on those relationships.\n*   **Abstract Thinking:** Lack of ability to abstract the underlying transformation.\n*   **Inaccuracy:** Struggles to accurately reproduce patterns even when those patterns are found in the training data.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. Without it, the system cannot effectively apply learned transformations to new inputs.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, categorized for clarity:\n\n*   **Data and Training:**\n    *   **Data Augmentation:** Implement a data augmentation pipeline. Rotate, flip, scale, and slightly distort the training examples. This will force the system to learn invariant features and more robust patterns. Add more data, with a wider distribution of options.\n    *   **Curriculum Learning:** Start with simpler transformations and gradually increase the complexity of the training data. For example, start with transformations that only affect a single cell or a small region, then move to more complex transformations that involve interactions between different parts of the grid.\n\n*   **Model Architecture and Design:**\n    *   **Introduce an Intermediate Representation:** Instead of directly mapping input grids to output grids, try representing the transformations as a series of steps or rules. For example, represent the rules as functions that map input cell coordinates and values to output cell coordinates and values.\n    *   **Spatial Reasoning Module:** Incorporate a spatial reasoning module. Explore using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the grid structure. CNNs can capture local spatial relationships, while GNNs can model more complex dependencies between cells.\n\n*   **Code Review and Implementation:**\n    *   **Transformation Logic:** Restructure the code generation process to explicitly separate the pattern extraction and transformation application steps.\n    *   **Explicit Rule Representation:** Implement an explicit rule-based system for transformation. This will make the system more transparent and easier to debug. For example, the system could learn rules like \"If cell (x, y) is 3, then cell (x+1, y+1) is 4\".\n\n*   **Error Analysis and Debugging:**\n    *   **Visualization:** Develop tools for visualizing the internal representations and intermediate steps of the system. This will help you understand how the system is processing the input and where it is going wrong.\n    *   **Debugging:** Create a method to actively debug and see the output of the grid's values so that you can properly debug the output.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. There is no indication of improvement. Without significant changes, the trend will likely remain stable. Focused efforts on the improvement areas listed above are crucial to initiate an upward trend.\n",

The pattern shown is found in the training data.\n*   **Sample 1:** The output shows a very distinct lack of any understanding, and replicates numbers in a row. It seems to take only 3 and 4 as being key parameters, and does not understand any complex understanding of input.\n*   **Sample 2:** The output shows a misunderstanding, and replicates a singular number across the whole grid, with no relation to the input.\n*   **Common Issues:**\n    *   **Incorrect Placement:** Values are placed in incorrect locations, indicating a lack of spatial awareness.\n    *   **Lack of Adaptation:**  The outputs don't adapt to the specific structure of the test input grids.\n    *   **Value hallucination:** The AI hallucinates what the correct values are, even if it has the correct pattern.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Syntactically Correct Output:**  Consistently generates valid Python code for a grid-like structure.\n*   **Format Recognition:** Identifies the required input/output format (grid-based matrix).\n*   **Basic Pattern Replication:** Shows an attempt to replicate patterns observed in the training data, indicating a rudimentary learning process.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:**  Inability to generalize patterns from training data to new input grids. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:**  Poor understanding of spatial relationships and applying transformations based on those relationships.\n*   **Abstract Thinking:** Lack of ability to abstract the underlying transformation.\n*   **Inaccuracy:** Struggles to accurately reproduce patterns even when those patterns are found in the training data.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. Without it, the system cannot effectively apply learned transformations to new inputs.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, categorized for clarity:\n\n*   **Data and Training:**\n    *   **Data Augmentation:** Implement a data augmentation pipeline. Rotate, flip, scale, and slightly distort the training examples. This will force the system to learn invariant features and more robust patterns. Add more data, with a wider distribution of options.\n    *   **Curriculum Learning:** Start with simpler transformations and gradually increase the complexity of the training data. For example, start with transformations that only affect a single cell or a small region, then move to more complex transformations that involve interactions between different parts of the grid.\n\n*   **Model Architecture and Design:**\n    *   **Introduce an Intermediate Representation:** Instead of directly mapping input grids to output grids, try representing the transformations as a series of steps or rules. For example, represent the rules as functions that map input cell coordinates and values to output cell coordinates and values.\n    *   **Spatial Reasoning Module:** Incorporate a spatial reasoning module. Explore using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the grid structure. CNNs can capture local spatial relationships, while GNNs can model more complex dependencies between cells.\n\n*   **Code Review and Implementation:**\n    *   **Transformation Logic:** Restructure the code generation process to explicitly separate the pattern extraction and transformation application steps.\n    *   **Explicit Rule Representation:** Implement an explicit rule-based system for transformation. This will make the system more transparent and easier to debug. For example, the system could learn rules like \"If cell (x, y) is 3, then cell (x+1, y+1) is 4\".\n\n*   **Error Analysis and Debugging:**\n    *   **Visualization:** Develop tools for visualizing the internal representations and intermediate steps of the system. This will help you understand how the system is processing the input and where it is going wrong.\n    *   **Debugging:** Create a method to actively debug and see the output of the grid's values so that you can properly debug the output.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. There is no indication of improvement. Without significant changes, the trend will likely remain stable. Focused efforts on the improvement areas listed above are crucial to initiate an upward trend.\n"

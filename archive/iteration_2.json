  "approach_summary": "This script solves scheduling problems by using a multi-agent approach with specialized LLMs for problem decomposition, constraint extraction, solution generation, and solution verification. It breaks down the problem into key components, extracts constraints, proposes a solution, and then uses a verifier agent to ensure the proposed solution satisfies all constraints. The workflow involves sequential calls to these LLM agents, culminating in a proposed meeting time or an error message.",

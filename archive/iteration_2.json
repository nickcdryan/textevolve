  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting constraints and generating potential time slots using the `extract_constraints_and_generate_options` function. Then, the `filter_and_verify_options` function filters the generated options based on constraints, and identifies a single valid option. Finally, the `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `extract_constraints_and_generate_options` and `filter_and_verify_options`, and then returns a formatted string representing the proposed time or an error message. The workflow uses LLMs as the reasoner for extracting data and verifying meeting times.",

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amanda and Nathan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nAmanda is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nNathan is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nAmanda do not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00. Nathan can not meet on Monday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: "

This includes information extraction pertaining to constraints, as well as the logic used to apply those constraints to generate feasible meeting times.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis, here are specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement the Dedicated Constraint Solver (Priority):**\n    *   **Task:** Replace the LLM's implicit constraint handling with a dedicated constraint solver implemented in Python using libraries like `schedule` or `python-constraint`.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   Create functions to translate the extracted constraints into a format suitable for the solver.\n        *   Use the constraint solver to generate a set of *feasible* timeslots.\n        *   Ensure the solver takes into account all participant schedules and preferences.\n    *   **Testing:** Create a test suite specifically for the constraint solver, using a variety of scheduling scenarios with complex constraints.\n2.  **Build a Solution Verification Module (Priority):**\n    *   **Task:** Create a module that explicitly verifies if a proposed solution satisfies all extracted constraints.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   The module should iterate through each participant and verify that the proposed time doesn't conflict with existing appointments or preferences.\n        *   The verification process should be detailed and report *exactly* which constraints are violated by a proposed time.\n    *   **Integration:** This module should be called *after* the constraint solver to ensure the solution is valid and *before* any output is generated.\n3.  **Fix Repetitive Data Error (High):**\n    *   **Task:** Identify and fix the bug causing the repetition of \"Monday\" in the output string.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   Carefully examine the code responsible for formatting the date and time.\n        *   Add unit tests to ensure the output format is always correct.\n4.  **Improve Information Extraction (Medium):**\n    *   **Task:** Improve the accuracy of information extraction, especially regarding preferences and complex schedule information.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   Experiment with few-shot learning, providing the LLM with more varied examples.\n        *   Use specialized extraction prompts tailored for schedules and preferences.\n5.  **Implement Multi-Stage LLM Reasoning (Medium):**\n    *   **Task:** Structure the LLM process into multiple stages.\n    *   **Details:**\n        *   Stage 1: LLM extracts constraints.\n        *   Stage 2: Constraint solver (as above) generates feasible timeslots.\n        *   Stage 3: LLM selects the \"best\" timeslot from the feasible options (considering soft constraints, if any).\n        *   Stage 4: The verification module checks the final selection.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance and the error patterns, the capabilities are currently **stable, but at a low level.** There's no evidence of improvement; the system consistently fails to meet the core requirements. A shift to the prioritized actionable recommendations will be necessary to see any positive trend. The focus on constraint handling is likely to result in significant performance improvements.\n"

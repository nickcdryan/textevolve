  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by first extracting structured information (participants, duration, days, schedules) using the `extract_info_structured` function, then verifying this extracted information for accuracy using the `verify_extracted_info` function, and finally finding an available meeting time using the `find_available_time` function. These functions utilize the `call_llm` function to communicate with the Gemini LLM with system instructions to guide the LLM's behavior. The `main` function orchestrates this workflow by calling each function in sequence and then returning the result.",

The system is designed to handle scheduling problems with multiple participants, constraints, and preferences, which is a complex task.\n2.  The system attempts to follow a structured approach to problem-solving, which is evident in the overall structure (though not in the current results).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system consistently fails to extract information from the input text, resulting in a generic \"Could not extract information\" error message across all provided cases. This suggests a fundamental flaw in the information extraction module.\n2.  The system lacks robustness in parsing diverse input formats related to schedules, participant names, and time constraints, leading to complete failure in extracting any usable data.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Failure:** The primary bottleneck is the consistent failure to extract relevant information from the input text. The parsing logic is likely too rigid and unable to handle variations in the input format or complexity.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling/Recovery:** When the information extraction fails, the system doesn't attempt any alternative strategies or fallback mechanisms. It simply throws an error and stops.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **\"Could not extract information\"**: This error occurs in all cases, pointing to a systemic issue in information extraction. It is not specific to any particular kind of scheduling constraint or number of participants.\n2.  **No Attempted Recovery**: After failing to extract information, there is no evidence of the system trying to re-parse, simplify the problem, or use any alternative approach. It immediately returns an error.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **rigid and brittle parsing logic within the `information_extraction` module**. The system likely relies on specific, pre-defined patterns (possibly regular expressions or rule-based systems) to extract participant names, schedules, and constraints. When the input deviates even slightly from these expected patterns, the extraction fails completely.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The system must improve its ability to extract information from the input text. Instead of rigid parsing techniques, it should utilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\n2.  **Error Handling:** The system should implement more robust error handling. When information extraction fails, it should attempt alternative extraction strategies, use LLM reasoning to simplify the task or ask for clarification.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace Rule-Based Parsing with LLM-Driven Extraction:**\n    *   Instead of relying on regex and rule-based parsing, use LLM calls like:\n        *   `extract_participants(text)` - \"Extract all participant names from the following text\"\n        *   `extract_schedule(text, participant)` - \"Extract the schedule for [participant] from the following text, including the days and times they are busy.\"\n        *   `extract_constraints(text)` - \"List the constraints for scheduling this meeting, including the duration, acceptable days, and any participant preferences\"\n    *   These LLM calls will provide structured data that can be passed to other modules.\n2.  **Implement Multi-Stage Information Extraction with Verification**:\n    *   Break the information extraction process into multiple stages (e.g., identify participants, extract schedules, identify constraints).\n    *   After each stage, use an LLM-based verification step to check the extracted information for completeness and accuracy. For example: `verify_extracted_schedule(extracted_schedule, original_text)` - \"Does this schedule accurately reflect the information in the provided text? If not, what is missing or incorrect?\"\n    *   If verification fails, attempt to re-extract the information using a different prompt or extraction strategy.\n3.  **Fallback Strategies**:\n    *   When initial information extraction fails, implement a fallback mechanism to simplify the problem. For instance, attempt to extract only the participant names and then use a separate LLM call to ask for each participant's availability.\n    *   Instead of failing completely, the system could try to reason about the possible times based on incomplete information, and ask for specific clarifications from the user, if possible.\n4.  **Use Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Schedule Parsing**:\n    *   Parsing schedules with complex time ranges and multiple days can be challenging. Implement chain-of-thought reasoning where the LLM first breaks down the schedule into individual time slots and then reasons about the availability of each participant.\n    *   Example: `analyze_schedule(text, participant)` - \"Let's analyze [participant]'s schedule step by step. First, list all the times they are busy on Monday. Then, list all the times they are busy on Tuesday, and so on. Finally, provide a summary of their overall availability.\"\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe current AI system demonstrates a foundational understanding of the scheduling problem domain but suffers from a critical deficiency in information extraction. Its potential is unrealized due to the inability to accurately parse and interpret input data. The system's structured approach is a strength, but the lack of robust parsing renders it essentially non-functional. **Overall, the system is currently assessed as having very low capability.**\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Structured Problem-Solving Approach:** The design indicates an intention to follow a structured approach to solving scheduling problems. This is a valuable foundation upon which to build.\n2.  **Problem Understanding:** The system correctly identifies the scheduling task as involving multiple participants, constraints, and preferences. This understanding is a good starting point.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Critical Information Extraction Failure:** The consistent inability to extract relevant information from input text is the system's most significant weakness. This prevents the system from progressing beyond the initial stage.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling and Recovery:** The system does not implement effective error handling or recovery mechanisms when information extraction fails. This results in premature termination and a poor user experience.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. The system needs to be able to reliably and accurately extract relevant data from the input text to proceed with the scheduling task.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe following changes should be implemented in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:** Replace the existing rule-based parsing logic with LLM calls. Use targeted prompts to extract specific information, such as participant names, schedules, and constraints.\n    *   Example Prompts:\n        *   `extract_participants(text)`: \"Extract all participant names from the following text.\"\n        *   `extract_schedule(text, participant)`: \"Extract the schedule for [participant] from the following text, including the days and times they are busy. Output in JSON format.\"\n        *   `extract_constraints(text)`: \"List the constraints for scheduling this meeting, including the duration, acceptable days, and any participant preferences. Output in JSON format.\"\n2.  **Implement Multi-Stage Information Extraction with Verification:**\n    *   Break down information extraction into distinct stages (e.g., participant identification, schedule extraction, constraint identification).\n    *   After each stage, use an LLM-based verification step to confirm the extracted information's completeness and accuracy.\n    *   Prompt Example: `verify_extracted_schedule(extracted_schedule, original_text)`: \"The extracted schedule is: [extracted_schedule]. Does this schedule accurately reflect the information in the following text: [original_text]? If not, what is missing or incorrect?

    "error_analysis_text": "Okay, I will perform a thorough forensic analysis of the provided error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system is designed to handle scheduling problems with multiple participants, constraints, and preferences, which is a complex task.\n2.  The system attempts to follow a structured approach to problem-solving, which is evident in the overall structure (though not in the current results).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system consistently fails to extract information from the input text, resulting in a generic \"Could not extract information\" error message across all provided cases. This suggests a fundamental flaw in the information extraction module.\n2.  The system lacks robustness in parsing diverse input formats related to schedules, participant names, and time constraints, leading to complete failure in extracting any usable data.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Failure:** The primary bottleneck is the consistent failure to extract relevant information from the input text. The parsing logic is likely too rigid and unable to handle variations in the input format or complexity.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling/Recovery:** When the information extraction fails, the system doesn't attempt any alternative strategies or fallback mechanisms. It simply throws an error and stops.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **\"Could not extract information\"**: This error occurs in all cases, pointing to a systemic issue in information extraction. It is not specific to any particular kind of scheduling constraint or number of participants.\n2.  **No Attempted Recovery**: After failing to extract information, there is no evidence of the system trying to re-parse, simplify the problem, or use any alternative approach. It immediately returns an error.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **rigid and brittle parsing logic within the `information_extraction` module**. The system likely relies on specific, pre-defined patterns (possibly regular expressions or rule-based systems) to extract participant names, schedules, and constraints. When the input deviates even slightly from these expected patterns, the extraction fails completely.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The system must improve its ability to extract information from the input text. Instead of rigid parsing techniques, it should utilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\n2.  **Error Handling:** The system should implement more robust error handling. When information extraction fails, it should attempt alternative extraction strategies, use LLM reasoning to simplify the task or ask for clarification.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace Rule-Based Parsing with LLM-Driven Extraction:**\n    *   Instead of relying on regex and rule-based parsing, use LLM calls like:\n        *   `extract_participants(text)` - \"Extract all participant names from the following text\"\n        *   `extract_schedule(text, participant)` - \"Extract the schedule for [participant] from the following text, including the days and times they are busy.\"\n        *   `extract_constraints(text)` - \"List the constraints for scheduling this meeting, including the duration, acceptable days, and any participant preferences\"\n    *   These LLM calls will provide structured data that can be passed to other modules.\n2.  **Implement Multi-Stage Information Extraction with Verification**:\n    *   Break the information extraction process into multiple stages (e.g., identify participants, extract schedules, identify constraints).\n    *   After each stage, use an LLM-based verification step to check the extracted information for completeness and accuracy. For example: `verify_extracted_schedule(extracted_schedule, original_text)` - \"Does this schedule accurately reflect the information in the provided text? If not, what is missing or incorrect?\"\n    *   If verification fails, attempt to re-extract the information using a different prompt or extraction strategy.\n3.  **Fallback Strategies**:\n    *   When initial information extraction fails, implement a fallback mechanism to simplify the problem. For instance, attempt to extract only the participant names and then use a separate LLM call to ask for each participant's availability.\n    *   Instead of failing completely, the system could try to reason about the possible times based on incomplete information, and ask for specific clarifications from the user, if possible.\n4.  **Use Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Schedule Parsing**:\n    *   Parsing schedules with complex time ranges and multiple days can be challenging. Implement chain-of-thought reasoning where the LLM first breaks down the schedule into individual time slots and then reasons about the availability of each participant.\n    *   Example: `analyze_schedule(text, participant)` - \"Let's analyze [participant]'s schedule step by step.

    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe current AI system demonstrates a foundational understanding of the scheduling problem domain but suffers from a critical deficiency in information extraction. Its potential is unrealized due to the inability to accurately parse and interpret input data. The system's structured approach is a strength, but the lack of robust parsing renders it essentially non-functional. **Overall, the system is currently assessed as having very low capability.**\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Structured Problem-Solving Approach:** The design indicates an intention to follow a structured approach to solving scheduling problems. This is a valuable foundation upon which to build.\n2.  **Problem Understanding:** The system correctly identifies the scheduling task as involving multiple participants, constraints, and preferences. This understanding is a good starting point.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Critical Information Extraction Failure:** The consistent inability to extract relevant information from input text is the system's most significant weakness. This prevents the system from progressing beyond the initial stage.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling and Recovery:** The system does not implement effective error handling or recovery mechanisms when information extraction fails. This results in premature termination and a poor user experience.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. The system needs to be able to reliably and accurately extract relevant data from the input text to proceed with the scheduling task.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe following changes should be implemented in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:** Replace the existing rule-based parsing logic with LLM calls. Use targeted prompts to extract specific information, such as participant names, schedules, and constraints.\n    *   Example Prompts:\n        *   `extract_participants(text)`: \"Extract all participant names from the following text.\"\n        *   `extract_schedule(text, participant)`: \"Extract the schedule for [participant] from the following text, including the days and times they are busy. Output in JSON format.\"\n        *   `extract_constraints(text)`: \"List the constraints for scheduling this meeting, including the duration, acceptable days, and any participant preferences. Output in JSON format.\"\n2.  **Implement Multi-Stage Information Extraction with Verification:**\n    *   Break down information extraction into distinct stages (e.g., participant identification, schedule extraction, constraint identification).\n    *   After each stage, use an LLM-based verification step to confirm the extracted information's completeness and accuracy.\n    *   Prompt Example: `verify_extracted_schedule(extracted_schedule, original_text)`: \"The extracted schedule is: [extracted_schedule]. Does this schedule accurately reflect the information in the following text: [original_text]? If not, what is missing or incorrect? Respond concisely with the missing/incorrect information or 'Accurate' if no issues.\"\n3.  **Develop Fallback Strategies:** Create alternative extraction strategies to employ when the initial attempt fails.

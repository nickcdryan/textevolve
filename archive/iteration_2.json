  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by extracting scheduling constraints with an extraction agent and verifying its correctness with a verification agent. It then utilizes the extracted information to find an available time slot, with explicit reasoning and verification, using a scheduling agent. The overall workflow involves `call_llm` for LLM interactions, `extract_data_with_verifier` to extract and verify the scheduling constraints from the given text, `find_available_time` to propose a meeting time, and `main` to orchestrate the entire scheduling process.",

The agent can then propose candidate solutions and verify them against the constraints. An iterative refinement loop can be used to resolve conflicts.\n\n2.  **Implement Detailed Error Logging:** Introduce detailed logging to capture the system's state at various stages of the scheduling process. Log participant schedules, constraints, candidate meeting times, and the reasons for rejecting certain times. This will provide invaluable insights into the system's behavior and help identify the root causes of errors.\n\n3.  **Develop a Constraint Satisfaction Module:** Consider incorporating a constraint satisfaction solver library. The system can translate the scheduling problem into a set of constraints and use the solver to find a valid solution. This will improve the system's ability to handle complex scheduling scenarios with multiple constraints and participants.\n\n4.  **Create Solution Verification Agent:** Before returning a solution, use an LLM verifier agent. The verifier agent should take in the proposed meeting time, the participant schedules, and the constraints.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment for your AI scheduling system based on the provided performance and error analysis, following the requested format:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of scheduling tasks and constraints, but its core scheduling logic is fundamentally flawed, leading to frequent errors. The lack of informative error handling prevents effective debugging and improvement. It has minimal practical value in its current state. The major problem is that it likely utilizes a rule-based approach for scheduling and does not leverage the power of LLMs for advanced planning and reasoning.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Task Recognition:** The system correctly identifies the problem as a scheduling task.\n*   **Constraint Awareness:** The system recognizes basic scheduling constraints (e.g., work hours, existing schedules).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Core Scheduling Logic:** The system's inability to generate valid schedules reliably is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Error Handling:** The system provides no useful information when errors occur, making debugging impossible.\n*   **Scalability:** The system struggles with multiple participants, indicating poor scalability.\n*   **Rigidity**: The system is inflexible and unable to adapt to complex schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Solution Generation**, specifically implementing an LLM-driven reasoning and planning engine for scheduling, as opposed to a rule-based scheduling system.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Reasoning Agent:** Replace the current scheduling algorithm with an LLM agent.\n    *   **Details:**  Create an agent that can ingest the scheduling request and participant schedules/constraints. This LLM agent should use chain-of-thought reasoning to generate candidate meeting times, considering all constraints. The agent should be prompted to explicitly state its reasoning for each choice.  **CRITICAL: Ensure LLM calls are used to parse the inputs and manage the reasoning, rather than regex or string splitting.**\n    *   **Expected Outcome:**  This will allow the system to reason about complex constraints, handle multiple participants, and adapt to different scheduling scenarios.\n\n2.  **Implement Solution Verification Agent:** Deploy an LLM agent to verify the validity of the proposed meeting time.\n    *   **Details:** This agent receives the proposed solution (meeting time), participant schedules, and constraints. Its task is to verify, step by step, that the proposed time doesn't conflict with existing commitments or violate any constraints. The agent should output \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" along with a detailed explanation of *why* the solution is valid or invalid.  Use this feedback to refine the solution or trigger a new solution generation attempt.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** This agent acts as a safety net, catching errors and improving the accuracy of the scheduling process.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement Loop:**  Create a loop where the Solution Verification Agent's output (pass/fail + explanation) is fed back to the Solution Generation Agent.\n    *   **Details:**  If the verifier agent finds a conflict, the generator agent should use the verifier's feedback to refine the proposed solution or generate a new one. This loop should repeat until a valid solution is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:**  This iterative process allows the system to learn from its mistakes and converge on a valid solution, leading to more reliable scheduling.\n\n4.  **Detailed Logging with LLM-Driven Analysis:** Integrate detailed logging to capture system state, and use an LLM to analyze these logs.\n    *   **Details:** Log the original scheduling request, participant schedules, constraints, proposed meeting times, the verifier agent's output (pass/fail and explanation), and the reasoning behind any solution refinements.  Then, periodically feed these logs to an LLM to identify recurring error patterns, weaknesses in reasoning, or areas for optimization.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:**  Provides continuous, automated insights into system behavior, enabling proactive identification and resolution of issues.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently **declining**. The system's consistently poor performance and lack of debugging information suggest that without significant changes, it will remain ineffective or potentially degrade further as complexity increases. Addressing the core scheduling logic and error handling is critical to reverse this trend.\n",

The system likely fails because it's trying to follow some deterministic method and doesn't have an LLM to reason about all of the scheduling options.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Scheduling Algorithm:** Implement a more robust and flexible scheduling algorithm, possibly leveraging LLM-based reasoning to handle complex constraints and participant preferences.\n*   **Error Handling:** Enhance the system's error handling mechanism to provide more specific and informative error messages. Include details about the nature of the scheduling conflict, the participants involved, and the specific constraints that were violated.\n*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Improve the system's ability to identify and enforce constraints. Consider using a constraint satisfaction solver to find valid meeting times.\n*   **Information Extraction:** While not the primary issue, ensure accurate extraction of participant schedules and preferences. If any constraints are not accurately captured, the scheduling algorithm will not be able to find solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace Deterministic Scheduling with LLM-Reasoning Agent:**  Instead of deterministic parsing and scheduling logic, create an LLM agent that uses chain-of-thought reasoning to analyze the schedules and constraints.  The agent can then propose candidate solutions and verify them against the constraints. An iterative refinement loop can be used to resolve conflicts.\n\n2.  **Implement Detailed Error Logging:** Introduce detailed logging to capture the system's state at various stages of the scheduling process. Log participant schedules, constraints, candidate meeting times, and the reasons for rejecting certain times. This will provide invaluable insights into the system's behavior and help identify the root causes of errors.\n\n3.  **Develop a Constraint Satisfaction Module:** Consider incorporating a constraint satisfaction solver library. The system can translate the scheduling problem into a set of constraints and use the solver to find a valid solution. This will improve the system's ability to handle complex scheduling scenarios with multiple constraints and participants.\n\n4.  **Create Solution Verification Agent:** Before returning a solution, use an LLM verifier agent. The verifier agent should take in the proposed meeting time, the participant schedules, and the constraints. It should then verify that the meeting time does not conflict with any of the participants' existing commitments and satisfies all given constraints.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 1:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 2:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 3:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 4:** constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment for your AI scheduling system based on the provided performance and error analysis, following the requested format:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of scheduling tasks and constraints, but its core scheduling logic is fundamentally flawed, leading to frequent errors. The lack of informative error handling prevents effective debugging and improvement. It has minimal practical value in its current state. The major problem is that it likely utilizes a rule-based approach for scheduling and does not leverage the power of LLMs for advanced planning and reasoning.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Task Recognition:** The system correctly identifies the problem as a scheduling task.\n*   **Constraint Awareness:** The system recognizes basic scheduling constraints (e.g., work hours, existing schedules).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Core Scheduling Logic:** The system's inability to generate valid schedules reliably is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Error Handling:** The system provides no useful information when errors occur, making debugging impossible.\n*   **Scalability:** The system struggles with multiple participants, indicating poor scalability.\n*   **Rigidity**: The system is inflexible and unable to adapt to complex schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Solution Generation**, specifically implementing an LLM-driven reasoning and planning engine for scheduling, as opposed to a rule-based scheduling system.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Reasoning Agent:** Replace the current scheduling algorithm with an LLM agent.\n    *   **Details:**  Create an agent that can ingest the scheduling request and participant schedules/constraints. This LLM agent should use chain-of-thought reasoning to generate candidate meeting times, considering all constraints. The agent should be prompted to explicitly state its reasoning for each choice.  **CRITICAL: Ensure LLM calls are used to parse the inputs and manage the reasoning, rather than regex or string splitting.**\n    *   **Expected Outcome:**  This will allow the system to reason about complex constraints, handle multiple participants, and adapt to different scheduling scenarios.\n\n2.  **Implement Solution Verification Agent:** Deploy an LLM agent to verify the validity of the proposed meeting time.\n    *   **Details:** This agent receives the proposed solution (meeting time), participant schedules, and constraints. Its task is to verify, step by step, that the proposed time doesn't conflict with existing commitments or violate any constraints. The agent should output \"Pass\" or \"Fail\" along with a detailed explanation of *why* the solution is valid or invalid.  Use this feedback to refine the solution or trigger a new solution generation attempt.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** This agent acts as a safety net, catching errors and improving the accuracy of the scheduling process.\n\n3.  **Iterative Refinement Loop:**  Create a loop where the Solution Verification Agent's output (pass/fail + explanation) is fed back to the Solution Generation Agent.\n    *   **Details:**  If the verifier agent finds a conflict, the generator agent should use the verifier's feedback to refine the proposed solution or generate a new one. This loop should repeat until a valid solution is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:**  This iterative process allows the system to learn from its mistakes and converge on a valid solution, leading to more reliable scheduling.\n\n4.  **Detailed Logging with LLM-Driven Analysis:** Integrate detailed logging to capture system state, and use an LLM to analyze these logs.\n    *   **Details:** Log the original scheduling request, participant schedules, constraints, proposed meeting times, the verifier agent's output (pass/fail and explanation), and the reasoning behind any solution refinements.  Then, periodically feed these logs to an LLM to identify recurring error patterns, weaknesses in reasoning, or areas for optimization.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:**  Provides continuous, automated insights into system behavior, enabling proactive identification and resolution of issues.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently **declining**. The system's consistently poor performance and lack of debugging information suggest that without significant changes, it will remain ineffective or potentially degrade further as complexity increases. Addressing the core scheduling logic and error handling is critical to reverse this trend.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a ReAct agent (`MeetingSchedulingAgent`) to schedule meetings by iteratively extracting information, generating schedules, and verifying them. The agent uses `call_llm` function to communicate with the Gemini API, with system instructions assigned. This agent uses helper functions such as `_extract_information`, `_generate_schedule`, and `_verify_schedule` to extract information, generate schedules, and verify the schedule respectively. The main function `main` orchestrates the whole process by initializing the agent and calling its solve method.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal a clear and dominant runtime error pattern: **\"too many values to unpack (expected 2)\"**. This error consistently prevents the system from proceeding past the initial stages of execution in samples 1, 3, and 4. This indicates that the unpacking error is triggered early in the ReAct loop, before other potential errors could be observed. The \"Could not find a valid solution\" errors in samples 0 and 2 further highlight the inability to handle solution generation and verification. This suggests that solution generation, even in successful ReAct loops, fails to produce valid solutions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates extremely limited capability. While it attempts to implement the ReAct pattern and is operating within a structured problem domain, its overall accuracy is effectively zero. The system's strengths are largely theoretical, as they are unrealized due to fundamental execution errors. The system's ability to perform effectively is severely hampered by the runtime errors that occur during the unpacking of values from the LLM. Even when the system attempts to proceed without these errors, it fails to find a valid solution.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Structured Problem Definition:** The scheduling domain provides a good foundation for building a constraint-based reasoning system.\n2.  **Attempted ReAct Pattern Implementation:** The intent to use the ReAct pattern is positive, as it is a suitable approach for this type of complex problem-solving.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Faulty ReAct Implementation:** The **primary** weakness is the incorrect handling of the ReAct loop, leading to the \"too many values to unpack\" runtime error.\n2.  **Inadequate Constraint Handling:** The system's ability to correctly extract and apply constraints is weak, leading to the inability to find valid solutions even when no runtime errors occur.\n3.  **Lack of Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust solution verification mechanism to ensure that proposed solutions meet all specified constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Execution**, specifically, correcting the ReAct step unpacking error. This is the foundational issue that prevents the system from performing any meaningful reasoning or problem-solving.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Fix ReAct Step Unpacking Error (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **Action:** Insert `print()` statements before each line where the LLM's output is unpacked to see its contents and format.\n    *   **Action:** Explicitly check the type and structure of the LLM output *before* unpacking. Use `isinstance()` and check the length/keys of lists/dictionaries returned.\n    *   **Action:** Modify unpacking to be more robust: use `.get()` for dictionaries to handle missing keys gracefully, or use slicing/looping for lists to handle variable lengths.\n    *   **Action:** Add `try...except ValueError:` blocks around unpacking operations to catch errors and log LLM output for debugging.\n\n    ```python\n    try:\n        # Assuming llm_output is a dictionary\n        value1 = llm_output.get(\"key1\")\n        value2 = llm_output.get(\"key2\")\n        if value1 is None or value2 is None:\n            print(f\"ERROR: Missing keys in LLM output: {llm_output}\")\n            # Handle the error appropriately (e.g., retry the LLM call)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"Unpacking error: {e}, LLM output: {llm_output}\")\n        # Handle the error appropriately\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement LLM Output Validation:**\n    *   **Action:** Create a function that uses the LLM (or a separate LLM call) to validate the structure and content of the LLM's output *before* any unpacking is attempted.\n\n    ```python\n    def validate_llm_output(output, expected_format_description):\n        validation_prompt = f\"\"\"\n        You are a validator.  Check if the following output conforms to this description: {expected_format_description}.\n        The output to validate is: {output}.\n        Respond with \"VALID\" if it conforms, otherwise respond with \"INVALID: [reason]\".\n        \"\"\"\n        validation_result = call_llm(validation_prompt)\n        return validation_result.startswith(\"VALID\")\n\n    llm_output = call_llm(some_prompt)\n    if validate_llm_output(llm_output, \"A JSON object with 'action' and 'result' keys\"):\n        action = llm_output[\"action\"]\n        result = llm_output[\"result\"]\n    else:\n        print(f\"Invalid LLM output: {llm_output}\")\n        # Handle appropriately\n    ```\n\n3.  **Enhance Constraint Handling (Once Execution is Stable):**\n    *   **Action:** After resolving the execution errors, focus on improving the system's ability to correctly extract and apply constraints. Add few-shot examples in the prompt that show constraint extraction and application to derive a feasible schedule.\n    *   **Action:** Add few-shot examples demonstrating constraint satisfaction using an iterative refinement pattern.\n\n4. **Implement Solution Verification Agent (Once Execution is Stable):**\n    * **Action:** Use an LLM-driven verifier agent that validates all constraints against any proposed solution.\n    * **Action:** Add negative constraints examples and show what violations looks like.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **declining** due to the fundamental execution errors. Until these errors are resolved, no meaningful progress can be made. Once the execution errors are addressed, the focus should shift to improving constraint handling and solution verification to move toward an **improving** capability trend.\n",

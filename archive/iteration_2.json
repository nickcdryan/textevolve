  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with an LLM to solve meeting scheduling problems, decomposing the task into constraint extraction, time slot finding, and solution verification. Specialized agents are simulated by the LLM through different system instructions, each focusing on a specific sub-task: extracting constraints, finding available time slots, and verifying the proposed solution against the initial question, respectively. The overall workflow involves sequentially calling the LLM to perform these three steps, returning a proposed solution if it's deemed valid.",

This often leads to missing valid solutions or proposing incorrect times.\n*   **Inefficient Schedule Analysis:** The system uses a basic, linear iteration approach to check for conflicts, which is not scalable or efficient, especially with a large number of participants. This approach makes it prone to errors since it cannot manage complex overlapping schedules and is prone to missing valid time slots.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Schedule Conflict Resolution:** The core bottleneck is the inability to efficiently and accurately resolve schedule conflicts across multiple participants to identify genuinely available time slots that meet all constraints. The current iterative approach is too simple and leads to incorrect conclusions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Missing Valid Solutions:** The system frequently fails to find valid time slots that actually exist within the constraints (Sample 3).\n*   **Incorrect Time Slot Identification:** The system sometimes identifies time slots that do not actually work, or that conflict with existing appointments (Sample 1).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate and inefficient multi-participant schedule analysis**. The system's current method for identifying free time slots is too simplistic and error-prone. The simple subtraction of blocked-out times from the total time is insufficient. It fails to consider complex overlapping busy periods or optimize the process of finding a valid solution.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Solution Verification:** Enhance the solution verification module to be more rigorous and capable of identifying errors in the calculated time slot. The verification must double-check if the suggested meeting time truly satisfies all constraints from every participant.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Strengthen the system's ability to handle constraints, specifically related to multiple participants and their individual schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a more robust schedule conflict resolution algorithm:**\n    *   **Employ Interval Tree data structure:** Represent each participant's schedule using interval trees. This would enable efficient overlap queries for checking conflicts when assessing a time slot.\n    *   **Boolean Logic Approach:** Treat each participant's availability as a boolean array (True = available, False = busy). Use bitwise AND operations across all participant arrays to find truly available time slots.\n2.  **Develop a dedicated schedule analysis function:**\n    *   Create a function that takes all participant schedules, the required duration, and the working hours as input. This function should return a definitive list of available time slots after performing conflict resolution.\n    *   Within this function, implement an early-exit strategy. If, during conflict resolution, it's determined that a given time slot cannot possibly work for all participants, the system should immediately move to the next slot without unnecessary computations.\n3.  **Add a cross-validation step:**\n    *   After identifying a potential time slot, have a cross-validation step. Create a function that takes the proposed time slot and re-verifies that each participant is indeed available during that time. This can catch errors in the conflict resolution algorithm.\n4.  **Refine Solution Verification agent**:\n    *   Instead of relying on simple checks, the solution verification agent should simulate the entire scheduling process again using the LLM, confirming that the proposed time is valid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   Solution Verification: Fails to identify that proposed solution is incorrect.\n    *   Constraint Handling: Fails to correctly apply the multiple constraints (schedules) to arrive at the correct solution.\n*   **Sample 3:**\n    *   Solution Generation: Fails to generate a valid solution from existing constraints.\n    *   Solution Verification: Fails to identify there are available slots\n    *   Constraint Handling: Inability to incorporate constraints from each of the participants.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a capability assessment report based on the performance summary, error analysis, and improvement suggestions provided.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a foundational understanding of scheduling tasks, including identifying participants, extracting individual schedules, and understanding meeting durations. However, its core capability of accurately resolving multi-participant schedule conflicts is significantly deficient. The system struggles with the complexity of overlapping schedules, leading to both missed valid solutions and incorrect time slot identification. The lack of an efficient and robust conflict resolution algorithm is a critical bottleneck that hinders overall performance. The reliance on a basic iterative approach is not scalable and prone to error.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Participant and Duration Identification:** The system correctly identifies the participants and duration of the meeting. This indicates a strong understanding of the basic input structure.\n*   **Individual Schedule Extraction:** The system can generally extract individual schedules for participants. This suggests a good capability for information extraction from text.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Calculation:** The system struggles with accurately determining available time slots, particularly when multiple participants are involved. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Inefficient Schedule Analysis:** The system uses a basic, linear iteration approach to check for conflicts, which is not scalable or efficient. This highlights the need for a more sophisticated algorithm.\n*   **Solution Verification Deficiencies**: Verification agent does not effectively identify inaccurate or missing solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Multi-Participant Schedule Conflict Resolution:** The single most important capability to focus on improving is the system's ability to efficiently and accurately resolve schedule conflicts across multiple participants. This directly addresses the core bottleneck identified in the error analysis.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust Conflict Resolution Algorithm Using Interval Trees and Boolean Logic (Explore):**\n    *   **Scripted Component:** Implement a Python module leveraging the `intervaltree` library (or similar) to represent each participant's schedule as an interval tree.\n    *   **LLM Integration:** The LLM agent will use this new python module to analyze the provided data, construct the interval trees, perform overlap queries to find available time slots. The LLM agent will call the python module as part of its reasoning process.\n    *   **Reasoning Example:**\n\n        ```python\n        # Example of using the interval tree to resolve conflicts\n        from intervaltree import Interval, IntervalTree\n\n        def find_available_times(schedules, duration, working_hours_start, working_hours_end):\n            \"\"\"\n            Finds available time slots for all participants using interval trees.\n\n            Args:\n                schedules (dict): A dictionary where keys are participant names and values are lists of busy time intervals.\n                duration (int): The required duration of the meeting in minutes.\n                working_hours_start (int): Start time of working hours in 24-hour format (e.g., 9 for 9:00 AM).\n                working_hours_end (int): End time of working hours in 24-hour format (e.g., 17 for 5:00 PM).\n\n            Returns:\n                list: A list of available time slots.\n            \"\"\"\n            # Initialize an interval tree for the combined busy times\n            combined_tree = IntervalTree()\n\n            # Add all busy intervals to the combined tree\n            for participant, busy_times in schedules.items():\n                for start, end in busy_times:\n                    combined_tree.addi(start, end)\n\n            # Convert working hours to minutes from midnight\n            working_start_minutes = working_hours_start * 60\n            working_end_minutes = working_hours_end * 60\n\n            # Find available time slots\n            available_slots = []\n            current_time = working_start_minutes\n\n            while current_time + duration <= working_end_minutes:\n                # Check if the interval is free\n                if not combined_tree.overlaps(current_time, current_time + duration):\n                    available_slots.append((current_time, current_time + duration))\n                current_time += 30  # Check every 30 minutes\n\n            return available_slots\n\n        # Example usage\n        schedules = {\n            \"Alice\": [(600, 720), (840, 900)],  # Alice is busy from 10:00-12:00 and 2:00-3:00\n            \"Bob\": [(660, 780), (900, 960)]     # Bob is busy from 11:00-13:00 and 3:00-4:00\n        }\n        duration = 60  # Meeting duration is 1 hour\n        working_hours_start = 9  # Working hours start at 9:00 AM\n        working_hours_end = 17  # Working hours end at 5:00 PM\n\n        available_times = find_available_times(schedules, duration, working_hours_start, working_hours_end)\n        print(\"Available time slots:\", available_times)\n        ```\n2.  **Enhance Solution Verification Agent with LLM Simulation (Exploit):**\n    *   The solution verification agent will perform a new step in its reasoning. It will leverage the LLM to analyze participant schedules and determine available time slots. It will then compare the generated available time slots with those identified by the standard method. If the generated solution does not match the LLM's findings, it will be flagged as potentially erroneous.\n3.  **Develop Dedicated Schedule Analysis Function and Enforce Early-Exit Strategy (Exploit):**\n    *   Refactor the schedule analysis logic into a separate, well-defined function. Within this function, implement an early-exit strategy to avoid unnecessary computations when a time slot is determined to be invalid.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's capabilities are currently **stable but inadequate**. While it possesses basic information extraction capabilities, the core scheduling functionality is unreliable. Implementing the recommended improvements should lead to a significant **improvement** in the system's overall performance and reliability.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## STRENGTHS\n\n*   The system can correctly identify the participants and the duration of the meeting.\n*   The system can generally extract individual schedules for participants.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Calculation:** The system struggles with accurately determining available time slots, particularly when multiple participants are involved and busy slots need to be considered collectively. This often leads to missing valid solutions or proposing incorrect times.\n*   **Inefficient Schedule Analysis:** The system uses a basic, linear iteration approach to check for conflicts, which is not scalable or efficient, especially with a large number of participants. This approach makes it prone to errors since it cannot manage complex overlapping schedules and is prone to missing valid time slots.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Schedule Conflict Resolution:** The core bottleneck is the inability to efficiently and accurately resolve schedule conflicts across multiple participants to identify genuinely available time slots that meet all constraints. The current iterative approach is too simple and leads to incorrect conclusions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Missing Valid Solutions:** The system frequently fails to find valid time slots that actually exist within the constraints (Sample 3).\n*   **Incorrect Time Slot Identification:** The system sometimes identifies time slots that do not actually work, or that conflict with existing appointments (Sample 1).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate and inefficient multi-participant schedule analysis**. The system's current method for identifying free time slots is too simplistic and error-prone. The simple subtraction of blocked-out times from the total time is insufficient. It fails to consider complex overlapping busy periods or optimize the process of finding a valid solution.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Solution Verification:** Enhance the solution verification module to be more rigorous and capable of identifying errors in the calculated time slot. The verification must double-check if the suggested meeting time truly satisfies all constraints from every participant.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Strengthen the system's ability to handle constraints, specifically related to multiple participants and their individual schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a more robust schedule conflict resolution algorithm:**\n    *   **Employ Interval Tree data structure:** Represent each participant's schedule using interval trees. This would enable efficient overlap queries for checking conflicts when assessing a time slot.\n    *   **Boolean Logic Approach:** Treat each participant's availability as a boolean array (True = available, False = busy). Use bitwise AND operations across all participant arrays to find truly available time slots.\n2.  **Develop a dedicated schedule analysis function:**\n    *   Create a function that takes all participant schedules, the required duration, and the working hours as input.

If, during conflict resolution, it's determined that a given time slot cannot possibly work for all participants, the system should immediately move to the next slot without unnecessary computations.\n3.  **Add a cross-validation step:**\n    *   After identifying a potential time slot, have a cross-validation step. Create a function that takes the proposed time slot and re-verifies that each participant is indeed available during that time. This can catch errors in the conflict resolution algorithm.\n4.  **Refine Solution Verification agent**:\n    *   Instead of relying on simple checks, the solution verification agent should simulate the entire scheduling process again using the LLM, confirming that the proposed time is valid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   Solution Verification: Fails to identify that proposed solution is incorrect.\n    *   Constraint Handling: Fails to correctly apply the multiple constraints (schedules) to arrive at the correct solution.\n*   **Sample 3:**\n    *   Solution Generation: Fails to generate a valid solution from existing constraints.\n    *   Solution Verification: Fails to identify there are available slots\n    *   Constraint Handling: Inability to incorporate constraints from each of the participants.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here is a capability assessment report based on the performance summary, error analysis, and improvement suggestions provided.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a foundational understanding of scheduling tasks, including identifying participants, extracting individual schedules, and understanding meeting durations. However, its core capability of accurately resolving multi-participant schedule conflicts is significantly deficient. The system struggles with the complexity of overlapping schedules, leading to both missed valid solutions and incorrect time slot identification. The lack of an efficient and robust conflict resolution algorithm is a critical bottleneck that hinders overall performance. The reliance on a basic iterative approach is not scalable and prone to error.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Participant and Duration Identification:** The system correctly identifies the participants and duration of the meeting. This indicates a strong understanding of the basic input structure.\n*   **Individual Schedule Extraction:** The system can generally extract individual schedules for participants. This suggests a good capability for information extraction from text.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Calculation:** The system struggles with accurately determining available time slots, particularly when multiple participants are involved. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Inefficient Schedule Analysis:** The system uses a basic, linear iteration approach to check for conflicts, which is not scalable or efficient. This highlights the need for a more sophisticated algorithm.\n*   **Solution Verification Deficiencies**: Verification agent does not effectively identify inaccurate or missing solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Multi-Participant Schedule Conflict Resolution:** The single most important capability to focus on improving is the system's ability to efficiently and accurately resolve schedule conflicts across multiple participants. This directly addresses the core bottleneck identified in the error analysis.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust Conflict Resolution Algorithm Using Interval Trees and Boolean Logic (Explore):**\n    *   **Scripted Component:** Implement a Python module leveraging the `intervaltree` library (or similar) to represent each participant's schedule as an interval tree.\n    *   **LLM Integration:** The LLM agent will use this new python module to analyze the provided data, construct the interval trees, perform overlap queries to find available time slots. The LLM agent will call the python module as part of its reasoning process.\n    *   **Reasoning Example:**\n\n        ```python\n        # Example of using the interval tree to resolve conflicts\n        from intervaltree import Interval, IntervalTree\n\n        def find_available_times(schedules, duration, working_hours_start, working_hours_end):\n            \"\"\"\n            Finds available time slots for all participants using interval trees.\n\n            Args:\n                schedules (dict): A dictionary where keys are participant names and values are lists of busy time intervals.\n                duration (int): The required duration of the meeting in minutes.\n                working_hours_start (int): Start time of working hours in 24-hour format (e.g., 9 for 9:00 AM).\n                working_hours_end (int): End time of working hours in 24-hour format (e.g., 17 for 5:00 PM).\n\n            Returns:\n                list: A list of available time slots.\n            \"\"\"\n            # Initialize an interval tree for the combined busy times\n            combined_tree = IntervalTree()\n\n            # Add all busy intervals to the combined tree\n            for participant, busy_times in schedules.items():\n                for start, end in busy_times:\n                    combined_tree.addi(start, end)\n\n            # Convert working hours to minutes from midnight\n            working_start_minutes = working_hours_start * 60\n            working_end_minutes = working_hours_end * 60\n\n            # Find available time slots\n            available_slots = []\n            current_time = working_start_minutes\n\n            while current_time + duration <= working_end_minutes:\n                # Check if the interval is free\n                if not combined_tree.overlaps(current_time, current_time + duration):\n                    available_slots.append((current_time, current_time + duration))\n                current_time += 30  # Check every 30 minutes\n\n            return available_slots\n\n        # Example usage\n        schedules = {\n            \"Alice\": [(600, 720), (840, 900)],  # Alice is busy from 10:00-12:00 and 2:00-3:00\n            \"Bob\": [(660, 780), (900, 960)]     # Bob is busy from 11:00-13:00 and 3:00-4:00\n        }\n        duration = 60  # Meeting duration is 1 hour\n        working_hours_start = 9  # Working hours start at 9:00 AM\n        working_hours_end = 17  # Working hours end at 5:00 PM\n\n        available_times = find_available_times(schedules, duration, working_hours_start, working_hours_end)\n        print(\"Available time slots:\", available_times)\n        ```\n2.  **Enhance Solution Verification Agent with LLM Simulation (Exploit):**\n    *   The solution verification agent will perform a new step in its reasoning. It will leverage the LLM to analyze participant schedules and determine available time slots. It will then compare the generated available time slots with those identified by the standard method. If the generated solution does not match the LLM's findings, it will be flagged as potentially erroneous.\n3.  **Develop Dedicated Schedule Analysis Function and Enforce Early-Exit Strategy (Exploit):**\n    *   Refactor the schedule analysis logic into a separate, well-defined function. Within this function, implement an early-exit strategy to avoid unnecessary computations when a time slot is determined to be invalid.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's capabilities are currently **stable but inadequate**. While it possesses basic information extraction capabilities, the core scheduling functionality is unreliable. Implementing the recommended improvements should lead to a significant **improvement** in the system's overall performance and reliability.\n"

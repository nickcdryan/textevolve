First, `extract_info_with_react` extracts the relevant details about the meeting question, and then `schedule_meeting` uses that to create the meeting schedule. The `verify_schedule` function validates the proposed schedule. The `main` function orchestrates the entire process, calling `extract_info_with_react` to extract details, `schedule_meeting` to propose a schedule, and `verify_schedule` to confirm its validity.",

This indicates a problem with constraint handling and solution verification.\n- The system struggles to find a valid meeting time that satisfies all constraints. This suggests a weakness in solution generation.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Constraint Handling and Solution Verification:** The system appears to have difficulty accurately assessing whether a proposed meeting time violates existing schedules and constraints. It flags times as invalid even when they are viable.\n- **Solution Generation:** The system doesn't seem to explore the entire solution space effectively or propose alternative times when initial attempts fail. It often stops at identifying conflicts rather than finding valid solutions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- The system frequently returns \"Error: INVALID\" followed by a list of conflicts, rather than proposing a specific meeting time, indicating a systematic issue in finding feasible solutions. The system seems to prematurely terminate its search upon finding an initial conflict, without exploring alternative slots.\n- There is a mismatch between system answers and golden answers. The system answers often mention conflicts, while golden answers propose a valid time. This suggests a divergence in the problem-solving approach.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **premature termination of the search for a valid solution upon encountering an initial scheduling conflict.** The system incorrectly concludes that no solution exists, even when alternative times are available.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Constraint Handling:** The system needs a more robust and accurate method for determining whether a proposed meeting time violates any constraints.\n- **Solution Generation:** The system needs to explore a broader range of potential meeting times and intelligently adapt its search based on identified conflicts.\n- **Solution Verification:** The system should verify proposed solutions against all constraints before reporting them as valid, ensuring that all participants are available.\n- **Error Handling and Recovery:** Implement a retry mechanism when conflicts are found. Instead of simply reporting an \"INVALID\" error, the system should attempt to find an alternative time slot.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Implement a backtracking algorithm:** When a conflict is detected for a proposed meeting time, the system should backtrack and try a different time slot.\n- **Prioritize constraints:** The system should prioritize constraints and attempt to satisfy the most critical constraints first.\n- **Implement a more sophisticated constraint checking:** Instead of only checking for exact time overlaps, the system should consider buffer times and other preferences.\n- **Introduce a \"search depth\" or \"max attempts\" parameter:** Limit the number of iterations the algorithm performs to avoid infinite loops, but also ensure it explores enough possibilities.\n- **Refine prompting:** Provide more examples of successful constraint handling and solution generation in the prompt.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample 0:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n- **Sample 1:** solution_generation\n- **Sample 2:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n- **Sample 4:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment report based on the performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines:\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error patterns identified earlier.\n\n*   **Premature Termination:** Outputs 1 and 3 show the system immediately reporting \"INVALID\" after detecting a conflict for one or more participants, without attempting to find alternative valid times. This confirms the core issue of premature termination.\n*   **Limited Solution Generation:** Output 2 is a success, proposing a time. However, given the low overall accuracy (20%), successes may be due to simpler scenarios without significant conflicts, or potentially even luck.\n*   **Error Messages:** Error messages only state the participants with the meetings, but lack helpful context on how to address those collisions.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system possesses a rudimentary capability to parse input and identify potential meeting times. However, its ability to handle constraints and find valid solutions is severely limited. The core issue is a lack of robustness in the search algorithm, leading to frequent failures even when valid solutions exist.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Input Processing:** The system can process input and identify participants, schedules, and constraints.\n*   **Solution Proposal:** It can propose at least one solution\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Constraint Handling & Solution Verification:**  Inaccurate assessment of constraint violations and incorrect flagging of valid times as invalid.\n*   **Solution Generation:** Inability to explore the solution space effectively and find alternative times.\n*   **Error Reporting:** The error messages lack actionable context.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Solution Generation**.  Without a robust mechanism for exploring potential meeting times and recovering from conflicts, the system will remain fundamentally flawed, regardless of improvements to constraint handling. We need to find a correct time at the cost of possible incorrect conflicts.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement a Backtracking Algorithm with Search Depth:**\n    *   **Rationale:**  Addresses premature termination and limited solution space exploration.\n    *   **Implementation:** Introduce a `search_depth` parameter (e.g., 5-10).  When a conflict is detected, the algorithm should *not* immediately report \"INVALID\". Instead, it should:\n        *   Record the conflict.\n        *   Increment a \"search depth\" counter.\n        *   Select a different potential meeting time based on the conflicts.\n        *   Repeat the constraint checking process.\n        *   If `search_depth` is exceeded without finding a solution, then and only then should the system report \"INVALID.\"\n    *   Add the following examples to the few-shot examples:\n        *   Examples where there are many conflicts, but one valid answer.\n        *   Examples where backtracking is required.\n2.  **Refine Error Reporting & Include Candidate Solutions:**\n    *   **Rationale:**  Provides more actionable information when a valid solution cannot be found.\n    *   **Implementation:**  When reporting \"INVALID,\" the system should:\n        *   List all participants.\n        *   List the best candidate times explored and the specific conflicts that occurred with each.\n        *   Use backtracking and include the times tried.\n        *   Add a new example that showcases the desired error messaging.\n3.  **Few-Shot Example Focus:**\n    *   **Rationale:** Improve constraint handling via more examples.\n    *   **Implementation:** Add 2-3 more few-shot examples to the prompt. These examples should:\n        *   Feature scenarios with multiple participants, overlapping schedules, and the need to intelligently navigate constraints.\n        *   Explicitly demonstrate the desired backtracking behavior.\n        *   Vary the constraints; include time preferences, meeting duration limitations, etc.\n4.  **Code Review & Simplify Conflict Detection:**\n    *   **Rationale:**  Address potential bugs in the constraint checking logic.\n    *   **Implementation:**  Conduct a careful code review of the `is_valid_time` (or equivalent) function to identify and correct any errors. Simplify the logic to improve readability and reduce the likelihood of bugs.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the current accuracy (20%) and the observed error patterns, the capabilities are currently **stable at a low level.** Without significant changes, the system will likely continue to perform poorly. The trend is currently neither improving nor declining. It's crucial to implement the actionable recommendations to shift the trend towards improvement.\n",

The system seems to be executing without crashing, but its logic is flawed, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n- The system can process the input question and identify participants, schedules, and constraints.\n- The system attempts to validate constraints related to meeting times.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n- The system frequently reports \"INVALID\" times based on misinterpreted scheduling conflicts, even when a valid time exists. This indicates a problem with constraint handling and solution verification.\n- The system struggles to find a valid meeting time that satisfies all constraints. This suggests a weakness in solution generation.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Constraint Handling and Solution Verification:** The system appears to have difficulty accurately assessing whether a proposed meeting time violates existing schedules and constraints. It flags times as invalid even when they are viable.\n- **Solution Generation:** The system doesn't seem to explore the entire solution space effectively or propose alternative times when initial attempts fail. It often stops at identifying conflicts rather than finding valid solutions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- The system frequently returns \"Error: INVALID\" followed by a list of conflicts, rather than proposing a specific meeting time, indicating a systematic issue in finding feasible solutions. The system seems to prematurely terminate its search upon finding an initial conflict, without exploring alternative slots.\n- There is a mismatch between system answers and golden answers. The system answers often mention conflicts, while golden answers propose a valid time. This suggests a divergence in the problem-solving approach.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **premature termination of the search for a valid solution upon encountering an initial scheduling conflict.** The system incorrectly concludes that no solution exists, even when alternative times are available.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Constraint Handling:** The system needs a more robust and accurate method for determining whether a proposed meeting time violates any constraints.\n- **Solution Generation:** The system needs to explore a broader range of potential meeting times and intelligently adapt its search based on identified conflicts.\n- **Solution Verification:** The system should verify proposed solutions against all constraints before reporting them as valid, ensuring that all participants are available.\n- **Error Handling and Recovery:** Implement a retry mechanism when conflicts are found. Instead of simply reporting an \"INVALID\" error, the system should attempt to find an alternative time slot.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Implement a backtracking algorithm:** When a conflict is detected for a proposed meeting time, the system should backtrack and try a different time slot.\n- **Prioritize constraints:** The system should prioritize constraints and attempt to satisfy the most critical constraints first.\n- **Implement a more sophisticated constraint checking:** Instead of only checking for exact time overlaps, the system should consider buffer times and other preferences.\n- **Introduce a \"search depth\" or \"max attempts\" parameter:** Limit the number of iterations the algorithm performs to avoid infinite loops, but also ensure it explores enough possibilities.\n- **Refine prompting:** Provide more examples of successful constraint handling and solution generation in the prompt.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample 0:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n- **Sample 1:** solution_generation\n- **Sample 2:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n- **Sample 4:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment report based on the performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines:\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error patterns identified earlier.\n\n*   **Premature Termination:** Outputs 1 and 3 show the system immediately reporting \"INVALID\" after detecting a conflict for one or more participants, without attempting to find alternative valid times. This confirms the core issue of premature termination.\n*   **Limited Solution Generation:** Output 2 is a success, proposing a time. However, given the low overall accuracy (20%), successes may be due to simpler scenarios without significant conflicts, or potentially even luck.\n*   **Error Messages:** Error messages only state the participants with the meetings, but lack helpful context on how to address those collisions.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system possesses a rudimentary capability to parse input and identify potential meeting times. However, its ability to handle constraints and find valid solutions is severely limited. The core issue is a lack of robustness in the search algorithm, leading to frequent failures even when valid solutions exist.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Input Processing:** The system can process input and identify participants, schedules, and constraints.\n*   **Solution Proposal:** It can propose at least one solution\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Constraint Handling & Solution Verification:**  Inaccurate assessment of constraint violations and incorrect flagging of valid times as invalid.\n*   **Solution Generation:** Inability to explore the solution space effectively and find alternative times.\n*   **Error Reporting:** The error messages lack actionable context.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Solution Generation**.  Without a robust mechanism for exploring potential meeting times and recovering from conflicts, the system will remain fundamentally flawed, regardless of improvements to constraint handling. We need to find a correct time at the cost of possible incorrect conflicts.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement a Backtracking Algorithm with Search Depth:**\n    *   **Rationale:**  Addresses premature termination and limited solution space exploration.\n    *   **Implementation:** Introduce a `search_depth` parameter (e.g., 5-10).  When a conflict is detected, the algorithm should *not* immediately report \"INVALID\". Instead, it should:\n        *   Record the conflict.\n        *   Increment a \"search depth\" counter.\n        *   Select a different potential meeting time based on the conflicts.\n        *   Repeat the constraint checking process.\n        *   If `search_depth` is exceeded without finding a solution, then and only then should the system report \"INVALID.\"\n    *   Add the following examples to the few-shot examples:\n        *   Examples where there are many conflicts, but one valid answer.\n        *   Examples where backtracking is required.\n2.  **Refine Error Reporting & Include Candidate Solutions:**\n    *   **Rationale:**  Provides more actionable information when a valid solution cannot be found.\n    *   **Implementation:**  When reporting \"INVALID,\" the system should:\n        *   List all participants.\n        *   List the best candidate times explored and the specific conflicts that occurred with each.\n        *   Use backtracking and include the times tried.\n        *   Add a new example that showcases the desired error messaging.\n3.  **Few-Shot Example Focus:**\n    *   **Rationale:** Improve constraint handling via more examples.\n    *   **Implementation:** Add 2-3 more few-shot examples to the prompt. These examples should:\n        *   Feature scenarios with multiple participants, overlapping schedules, and the need to intelligently navigate constraints.\n        *   Explicitly demonstrate the desired backtracking behavior.\n        *   Vary the constraints; include time preferences, meeting duration limitations, etc.\n4.  **Code Review & Simplify Conflict Detection:**\n    *   **Rationale:**  Address potential bugs in the constraint checking logic.\n    *   **Implementation:**  Conduct a careful code review of the `is_valid_time` (or equivalent) function to identify and correct any errors. Simplify the logic to improve readability and reduce the likelihood of bugs.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the current accuracy (20%) and the observed error patterns, the capabilities are currently **stable at a low level.** Without significant changes, the system will likely continue to perform poorly. The trend is currently neither improving nor declining. It's crucial to implement the actionable recommendations to shift the trend towards improvement.\n"

In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.  In the second quarter, the Jaguars got on the board with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Colts replied with Manning and Clark hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, Jacksonville tried to come back as QB David Garrard completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Mercedes Lewis for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with Manning completing a 1-yard TD pass to RB Luke Lawton. Afterwards, Jacksonville tried to come back as Garrard completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt (along with getting the 2-point conversion run). Indianapolis' defense managed to seal the deal. With their season-sweep over the Jaguars, the Colts improved to 10-2. During the game, the Colts gave Garrard his first interception of the year, courtesy of Safety Antoine Bethea.\n\n    Keywords: player, field goal\n    Simplified Passage: In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal.\n\n    Example 2:\n    Question: Which star has a smaller mass, Nu Phoenicis or Gliese 915?\n    Passage: Nu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 \u00b1 0.01 (2.45 \u00b7 108) centimetre\u00b7second\u22122, or approximately 250,000 of Earths gravity.\n\n    Keywords: star, mass, Nu Phoenicis, Gliese 915\n    Simplified Passage: Nu Phoenicis is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun. Gliese 915 has around 85% of the mass of the Sun.\n\n    Example 3:\n    Question: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown pass than the longest field goal?\n    Passage: Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West divisional rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome. Peyton Manning finished the day with the first 0.0 passer rating of his career.\n\n    Keywords: yards, longest touchdown pass, longest field goal\n    Simplified Passage: the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a hybrid approach, combining direct LLM calls with multi-stage analysis for question answering. It decomposes the problem into keyword identification and passage simplification, information extraction with examples, and verification. There are two agent roles: Passage Simplifier, Information Extractor and Answer Verifier and Corrector.\n\nThe main function orchestrates the process, first using `call_llm` with a \"Passage Simplifier\" to simplify the input passage. It then calls `call_llm` again with an \"Information Extractor\" to extract a concise answer. Finally, it calls `call_llm` a third time with an \"Answer Verifier and Corrector\" to verify the extracted answer and correct it if needed. The `call_llm` function is a wrapper for interacting with the Gemini LLM, taking a prompt and optional system instruction as input.",

With three large culverins, four guns and three small culverins, Farra  repulsed the enemy artillery with heavy losses. The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano. In September, Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 . Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships and on land by the war in Mantua. Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj.\n\nQUESTION: How many Dutch and English warships were blocking Spanish support?",

The Seahawks drove the ball easily on their first possession, moving to the Ram 1-yard line. After a false start penalty, Seneca Wallace was sacked and fumbled, and the Rams returned the ball 89 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks drove down the field again, this time maintaining possession to the endzone as Darrell Jackson caught a 3-yard TD pass. The lead would change hands 6 more times in the game. With the Rams holding a 16-14 lead in the fourth quarter, Rams coach Scott Linehan chose to challenge a call, nullifying a field goal. The challenge was upheld, but the Rams still faced a fourth down play. Instead of kicking another field goal to increase the lead, Linehan chose to go for a first down. The raucous Qwest Field rose to the occasion, and Rams FB Paul Smith could not hear the play call. Rather than run a pass route he stayed in the backfield to block, and Ram QB Marc Bulger's pass to double covered TE Klopfenstein fell incomplete.

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Livonian War  was fought for control of Old Livonia , when the Tsardom of Russia faced a varying coalition of Denmark-Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Union  of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. During the period 1558-1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat  and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland-Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.\n\nQUESTION: What event happened first, Magnus's defection, or the Truce of Jam Zapolski?",

Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland-Lithuania.

With three large culverins, four guns and three small culverins, Farra  repulsed the enemy artillery with heavy losses. The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano. In September, Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 . Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships and on land by the war in Mantua. Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj.",

The Seahawks drove the ball easily on their first possession, moving to the Ram 1-yard line. After a false start penalty, Seneca Wallace was sacked and fumbled, and the Rams returned the ball 89 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks drove down the field again, this time maintaining possession to the endzone as Darrell Jackson caught a 3-yard TD pass. The lead would change hands 6 more times in the game. With the Rams holding a 16-14 lead in the fourth quarter, Rams coach Scott Linehan chose to challenge a call, nullifying a field goal. The challenge was upheld, but the Rams still faced a fourth down play. Instead of kicking another field goal to increase the lead, Linehan chose to go for a first down. The raucous Qwest Field rose to the occasion, and Rams FB Paul Smith could not hear the play call. Rather than run a pass route he stayed in the backfield to block, and Ram QB Marc Bulger's pass to double covered TE Klopfenstein fell incomplete. Nate Burleson returned a punt 90 yards for a touchdown and a 21-16 lead. After a Rams TD with 2:37 remaining, a series of penalties against St. Louis changed momentum. A holding penalty nullified a successful 2 point convert. The second attempt failed. A 15-yard personal foul was assessed on the subsequent kickoff, and Josh Scobey returned the ball to the Ram 49-yard line. With a short field and time on the clock, Seneca Wallace and Maurice Morris drove the Seahawks to the Ram 20-yard line, where Josh Brown kicked a game-winning field goal with 9 seconds remaining.

While the Texans defense held off the Steelers' offense, the offense managed to gain much-needed momentum in the 1st quarter, a place they had previously struggled. The Texans scored first with 5:55 left after Blue caught a pass from Fitzpatrick to lead 7-0. In the second quarter Ben Roethlisberger was sacked by Watt and fumbled the ball near midfield. Houston capitalized on the turnover with a Bullock 39 yard field goal to lead 10-0 with 13:39 left in the 2nd.

This is evidenced by the success in examples 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n2.  **Information Retrieval:** The system is able to successfully retrieve relevant information from the passage to answer the question, as seen in all the success cases.\n3.  **Implicit Matching:** The system can sometimes successfully identify implicit matches between the question and the passage, even if the wording is not identical (e.g., converting \"two\" to \"2\").\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\nSince there are no error cases to analyze, it's difficult to identify specific weaknesses. However, based on common issues in similar tasks, we can hypothesize potential weaknesses:\n\n1.  **Complex Reasoning:** The system might struggle with questions that require more complex reasoning, such as multi-step inference or comparing and contrasting information from different parts of the passage.\n2.  **Ambiguity Handling:** The system may have difficulty handling ambiguous or vague questions, especially if the passage contains multiple possible answers or conflicting information.\n3.  **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system might lack a deep understanding of the context, leading to incorrect answers when background knowledge or common sense is required.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\nWithout specific error cases, it's challenging to pinpoint critical bottlenecks. However, based on the hypothesized weaknesses, the critical bottleneck is likely:\n\n1.  **Limited Reasoning Capabilities:** The system's reasoning capabilities seem to be the primary bottleneck, limiting its ability to handle complex questions and make accurate inferences.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nNo error patterns can be discerned since there are no error cases to analyze.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem to address, based on the successful cases and general observations is:\n\n**Improving the system's reasoning capabilities to handle more complex questions and requiring deeper contextual understanding.**\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Reasoning Engine:** Enhance the reasoning engine to support multi-step inference, comparison, and contrast of information.\n2.  **Contextual Understanding:** Incorporate techniques for better contextual understanding, such as using knowledge graphs or pre-trained language models with improved common sense reasoning capabilities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy:** CoT prompting can help the system break down complex questions into smaller, more manageable steps, improving reasoning accuracy.\n2.  **Fine-tune a pre-trained language model:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on a dataset of question-answering examples that require complex reasoning can improve the system's performance on these types of questions.\n3.  **Introduce external knowledge sources:** Integrate external knowledge sources, such as knowledge graphs or Wikipedia, to provide the system with additional information that can help it answer questions that require background knowledge.\n4.  **Implement a more robust error detection and correction mechanism:** This could involve using techniques such as self-consistency or ensemble methods to identify and correct errors in the system's reasoning process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nSince there are no error cases, capability mapping is not applicable.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment based on the provided information, focusing on actionable insights and recommendations:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe `SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS` provide valuable insight into how the AI system generates its answers. The format `ANSWER_START\\n<number>\\nANSWER_END\\n` suggests the system is designed to identify the *character index* within the input text where the answer begins and ends.\n\n**Potential Issues Identified:**\n\n*   **Rigidity of the Output Format:** The system *must* identify a start and end index within the existing text. This prevents it from synthesizing answers, drawing conclusions, or providing answers not explicitly stated in the source.  It is *solely* an extraction system.\n*   **Single Answer Selection:** The system provides only one answer span. If multiple correct answers exist, it will arbitrarily choose one or fail to capture the full scope.\n*   **Potential Off-by-One Errors:**  While accuracy is reported as perfect, careful review of the actual text and the start/end indices is *critical*.  A \"near miss\" is still an error.  Even one character off will disrupt downstream processes. (Needs validation)\n*   **Dependency on Accurate Tokenization/Character Counting:** The system's accuracy hinges on the precise character counting/tokenization used during processing. Inconsistencies in tokenization between training/evaluation and deployment can lead to failures.\n*   **Lack of Confidence/Uncertainty Handling:** The system provides *no* indication of confidence in its answer. There's no way to tell if it's very certain or merely guessing.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates strong capabilities in **precise information extraction**.  It can locate and identify numerical data within provided text and return the character indices. This is a *highly constrained* capability.  It is NOT reasoning or question answering.\n\n**Limitations:**  The system is brittle and vulnerable to subtle changes in input or requirements. It is *not* a general-purpose AI.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Precision:** The system currently exhibits excellent precision in identifying the character indices of answers within the input text (based on reported 1.0 accuracy, pending index validation).\n*   **Efficiency:** Assuming low latency, the execution output indicates a relatively efficient process for locating and returning answer spans.\n*   **Structured Output:** The consistent output format (`ANSWER_START...ANSWER_END`) facilitates easy integration into other systems.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Generalization:**  The system is highly specialized for *extraction only*.  It cannot synthesize information or provide answers not explicitly found within the input.\n*   **Brittle Output:** The reliance on character indices makes it extremely sensitive to tokenization changes, data preprocessing differences, or any modifications to the source text.\n*   **No Confidence Scores:** The absence of confidence scores makes it impossible to assess the reliability of the answers.\n*   **Inability to Handle Multiple Answers:** The system is limited to returning a single answer span, even if multiple correct answers exist.\n*   **Missing Reasoning Capabilities:** Cannot handle questions requiring inference, comparison, or any form of deduction.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Generalization and Reasoning**.  The system needs to move beyond simple extraction to truly understand the content and answer more complex questions.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Answer Synthesis:**  Modify the system to allow it to construct answers *beyond* simply extracting spans from the text.  This could involve generating text or performing calculations based on the extracted information.\n2.  **Add Confidence Scoring:**  Include a confidence score (e.g., a probability) alongside each answer. This allows downstream systems to assess the reliability of the answer and potentially request alternatives.\n3.  **Support Multiple Answers:** Enable the system to return multiple possible answers, ranked by confidence score.\n4.  **Abstract Away from Character Indices:** Replace the character index-based output with a more robust representation, such as:\n    *   **Semantic Span Representation:** Identify the answer by its semantic meaning rather than its exact location. (e.g., use word embeddings or a knowledge graph to represent the answer).\n    *   **Answer Generation:** Generate the answer directly instead of extracting it.\n5.  **Introduce a Reasoning Component:** Integrate a reasoning component, such as a rule-based engine or a neural network-based reasoner, to handle questions that require inference or deduction.\n6.  **End-to-End Validation:**  Thoroughly validate the character indices returned by the system against the actual source text to identify and correct any off-by-one errors or inconsistencies. (CRITICAL)\n7.  **Expand Evaluation Data:**  Create a diverse set of test cases that include questions requiring various reasoning skills (e.g., multi-hop reasoning, comparison, contrast).\n8.  **Implement Error Analysis and Debugging Workflows:** Create an error analysis and debugging workflow. This workflow should enable error case creation from your team, which could be used to target fine-tuning and system improvement. This should also include integration with your system logging for forensic analysis on error cases.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current state, the capability trend is **stable but limited**.  Without significant changes, the system will remain a precise but inflexible information extractor. The recommendations above are designed to shift the trend towards **improving and more generalizable capabilities**.\n",

However, based on common issues in similar tasks, we can hypothesize potential weaknesses:\n\n1.  **Complex Reasoning:** The system might struggle with questions that require more complex reasoning, such as multi-step inference or comparing and contrasting information from different parts of the passage.\n2.  **Ambiguity Handling:** The system may have difficulty handling ambiguous or vague questions, especially if the passage contains multiple possible answers or conflicting information.\n3.  **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system might lack a deep understanding of the context, leading to incorrect answers when background knowledge or common sense is required.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\nWithout specific error cases, it's challenging to pinpoint critical bottlenecks. However, based on the hypothesized weaknesses, the critical bottleneck is likely:\n\n1.  **Limited Reasoning Capabilities:** The system's reasoning capabilities seem to be the primary bottleneck, limiting its ability to handle complex questions and make accurate inferences.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nNo error patterns can be discerned since there are no error cases to analyze.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem to address, based on the successful cases and general observations is:\n\n**Improving the system's reasoning capabilities to handle more complex questions and requiring deeper contextual understanding.**\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Reasoning Engine:** Enhance the reasoning engine to support multi-step inference, comparison, and contrast of information.\n2.  **Contextual Understanding:** Incorporate techniques for better contextual understanding, such as using knowledge graphs or pre-trained language models with improved common sense reasoning capabilities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy:** CoT prompting can help the system break down complex questions into smaller, more manageable steps, improving reasoning accuracy.\n2.  **Fine-tune a pre-trained language model:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on a dataset of question-answering examples that require complex reasoning can improve the system's performance on these types of questions.\n3.  **Introduce external knowledge sources:** Integrate external knowledge sources, such as knowledge graphs or Wikipedia, to provide the system with additional information that can help it answer questions that require background knowledge.\n4.  **Implement a more robust error detection and correction mechanism:** This could involve using techniques such as self-consistency or ensemble methods to identify and correct errors in the system's reasoning process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nSince there are no error cases, capability mapping is not applicable.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment based on the provided information, focusing on actionable insights and recommendations:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe `SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS` provide valuable insight into how the AI system generates its answers. The format `ANSWER_START\\n<number>\\nANSWER_END\\n` suggests the system is designed to identify the *character index* within the input text where the answer begins and ends.\n\n**Potential Issues Identified:**\n\n*   **Rigidity of the Output Format:** The system *must* identify a start and end index within the existing text. This prevents it from synthesizing answers, drawing conclusions, or providing answers not explicitly stated in the source.  It is *solely* an extraction system.\n*   **Single Answer Selection:** The system provides only one answer span. If multiple correct answers exist, it will arbitrarily choose one or fail to capture the full scope.\n*   **Potential Off-by-One Errors:**  While accuracy is reported as perfect, careful review of the actual text and the start/end indices is *critical*.  A \"near miss\" is still an error.  Even one character off will disrupt downstream processes. (Needs validation)\n*   **Dependency on Accurate Tokenization/Character Counting:** The system's accuracy hinges on the precise character counting/tokenization used during processing. Inconsistencies in tokenization between training/evaluation and deployment can lead to failures.\n*   **Lack of Confidence/Uncertainty Handling:** The system provides *no* indication of confidence in its answer. There's no way to tell if it's very certain or merely guessing.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates strong capabilities in **precise information extraction**.  It can locate and identify numerical data within provided text and return the character indices. This is a *highly constrained* capability.  It is NOT reasoning or question answering.\n\n**Limitations:**  The system is brittle and vulnerable to subtle changes in input or requirements. It is *not* a general-purpose AI.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Precision:** The system currently exhibits excellent precision in identifying the character indices of answers within the input text (based on reported 1.0 accuracy, pending index validation).\n*   **Efficiency:** Assuming low latency, the execution output indicates a relatively efficient process for locating and returning answer spans.\n*   **Structured Output:** The consistent output format (`ANSWER_START...ANSWER_END`) facilitates easy integration into other systems.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Generalization:**  The system is highly specialized for *extraction only*.  It cannot synthesize information or provide answers not explicitly found within the input.\n*   **Brittle Output:** The reliance on character indices makes it extremely sensitive to tokenization changes, data preprocessing differences, or any modifications to the source text.\n*   **No Confidence Scores:** The absence of confidence scores makes it impossible to assess the reliability of the answers.\n*   **Inability to Handle Multiple Answers:** The system is limited to returning a single answer span, even if multiple correct answers exist.\n*   **Missing Reasoning Capabilities:** Cannot handle questions requiring inference, comparison, or any form of deduction.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Generalization and Reasoning**.  The system needs to move beyond simple extraction to truly understand the content and answer more complex questions.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Answer Synthesis:**  Modify the system to allow it to construct answers *beyond* simply extracting spans from the text.  This could involve generating text or performing calculations based on the extracted information.\n2.  **Add Confidence Scoring:**  Include a confidence score (e.g., a probability) alongside each answer. This allows downstream systems to assess the reliability of the answer and potentially request alternatives.\n3.  **Support Multiple Answers:** Enable the system to return multiple possible answers, ranked by confidence score.\n4.  **Abstract Away from Character Indices:** Replace the character index-based output with a more robust representation, such as:\n    *   **Semantic Span Representation:** Identify the answer by its semantic meaning rather than its exact location. (e.g., use word embeddings or a knowledge graph to represent the answer).\n    *   **Answer Generation:** Generate the answer directly instead of extracting it.\n5.  **Introduce a Reasoning Component:** Integrate a reasoning component, such as a rule-based engine or a neural network-based reasoner, to handle questions that require inference or deduction.\n6.  **End-to-End Validation:**  Thoroughly validate the character indices returned by the system against the actual source text to identify and correct any off-by-one errors or inconsistencies. (CRITICAL)\n7.  **Expand Evaluation Data:**  Create a diverse set of test cases that include questions requiring various reasoning skills (e.g., multi-hop reasoning, comparison, contrast).\n8.  **Implement Error Analysis and Debugging Workflows:** Create an error analysis and debugging workflow. This workflow should enable error case creation from your team, which could be used to target fine-tuning and system improvement. This should also include integration with your system logging for forensic analysis on error cases.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current state, the capability trend is **stable but limited**.  Without significant changes, the system will remain a precise but inflexible information extractor. The recommendations above are designed to shift the trend towards **improving and more generalizable capabilities**.\n"

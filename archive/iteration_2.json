  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using an LLM to infer and apply localized transformation rules. It decomposes the problem into information extraction, rule inference, rule application, and verification steps, each handled by prompting the LLM. The agent role is a grid transformation expert, and other functions include `call_llm`, which facilitates interaction with the Gemini LLM. The script's workflow begins with `solve_grid_transformation`, which calls `call_llm` to extract information, infer transformation rules, apply them to a test grid, and verify the result.",

The system is reporting \"Unable to transform the grid correctly,\" indicating a logical/reasoning error rather than a runtime exception.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system can apparently process the input and training examples without crashing (no runtime errors reported).\n2.  The system attempts to follow the task instructions by trying to transform the grid.\n3. The system is able to generate a JSON output (even if incorrect), showing some capacity for structured output.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition/Generalization:** The system fails to correctly identify and generalize the transformation pattern from the training examples to the test input. This is evident in all error cases.\n2.  **Grid Manipulation:** The system demonstrates an inability to correctly manipulate the grid data based on learned patterns. It outputs placeholder responses or incorrect transformations.\n3.  **Output Formatting:** In sample 2 and 3, the output format is not consistent with that of the golden answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Pattern Generalization in Grid Transformations:** The core bottleneck is the system's inability to generalize from the training examples to apply the correct grid transformation logic to new, unseen input grids. This prevents the system from generating the correct output.\n2.  **Reasoning about Spatial Relationships:** A related bottleneck is the inability to reason about the spatial relationships and dependencies within the grid data. The system isn't capturing the underlying logic of how changes in one cell affect others.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent \"Unable to transform the grid correctly\" Response:**  A recurring pattern is the system's inability to correctly perform the grid transformation, resulting in generic failure messages. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the transformation logic.\n2.  **Incorrect Grid Dimensions/Structure in Output:** The system sometimes produces outputs with the wrong dimensions or structure, showcasing an issue with how the output grid is constructed.\n3.  **Inability to apply the correct number and pattern:** The systems fails to apply numbers based on the pattern from training sets.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **failure to learn and generalize the grid transformation logic from the provided training examples.** The system isn't able to extract the underlying rules and apply them to new input grids. This could stem from inadequate feature extraction, a weak pattern-matching algorithm, or an inability to reason about spatial relationships within the grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition and Feature Extraction:** Enhance the system's ability to extract meaningful features from the input and output grids in the training examples. This could involve identifying relative positions of numbers, identifying patterns of change, and recognizing symmetries.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning:**  Improve the system's capacity to reason about spatial relationships between elements in the grid. This might involve using convolutional neural networks or other techniques that are designed to process spatial data.\n3.  **Constraint Handling:** Improve constraint handling so that outputs align with golden outputs.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**  CNNs are well-suited for processing grid-like data and learning spatial relationships.  Train a CNN on the training examples to predict the output grid given the input grid.\n2.  **Develop a Rule-Based System:** Explore a rule-based approach where rules are defined to describe the grid transformations. These rules could be learned from the training data.\n3.  **Implement Intermediate Steps with Print Statements:** Add debugging print statements in the transformation code to show intermediate grid states during processing. This will help identify precisely where the transformation logic fails. Track what features are extracted.\n4.  **Increase Training Data Variety:** Increase the number and diversity of training examples to improve the system's ability to generalize. Add examples that showcase different patterns and complexities.\n5.  **Add Input Validation:** Implement checks to ensure the input grid conforms to expected dimensions and data types. This can prevent errors caused by malformed input.\n6. **Add constraints to output formatting**\n7. **Try out LLM fine-tuning on Grid transformation tasks**\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (pattern not recognized)\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation)\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed (did not produce correct solution)\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (pattern not recognized)\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation)\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed (did not produce correct solution)\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n*   information\\_extraction: Failed (pattern not recognized)\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed (incorrect transformation)\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed (did not produce correct solution)\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed (output not of correct dimensions)\n",

Implement constraint handling to ensure the output dimension requirements are also met.\n5. **Fine-tune on Grid Transformation Tasks**: Try fine-tuning the model on this grid transformation task.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0% accuracy), the capabilities are currently **stable but critically low**.

This will provide a more robust approach to pattern recognition than the current method.\n2.  **Add Intermediate Logging:** Implement print statements to show intermediate grid states during the transformation process. Track the input features being extracted from the grid. This will allow for precise debugging of the transformation logic.\n3.  **Increase Training Data with Targeted Examples:** Specifically, create and include training examples that represent various transformation patterns, including translations, rotations, reflections, and combinations thereof.\n4. **Implement Input Validation and Constraints Handling** Add input validation to ensure the input meets the dimension requirements. Implement constraint handling to ensure the output dimension requirements are also met.\n5. **Fine-tune on Grid Transformation Tasks**: Try fine-tuning the model on this grid transformation task.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0% accuracy), the capabilities are currently **stable but critically low**. Without significant intervention and improvement in the areas identified, the system will remain ineffective. The recommendations above aim to shift the trend towards improvement.\n"

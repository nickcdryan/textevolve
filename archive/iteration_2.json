  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage reasoning approach with LLMs to answer factual questions, simulating knowledge graph integration. The problem is decomposed into entity/relationship extraction, knowledge graph lookup, answer synthesis, and validation, each handled by the `call_llm` function with specific system instructions to define agent roles. The `call_llm` function is used to query the Gemini LLM for each stage, passing tailored prompts and system instructions to guide the LLM's behavior. The overall workflow involves extracting entities, looking up information, synthesizing an answer, validating it, and returning the answer if valid.",

This is evident in all error cases, where the system provides a different answer than the golden answer.\n*   **Validation Failure:** In one case, the system returns \"Could not be validated.\" This indicates a problem with the validation process, potentially due to a lack of relevant information or an inability to confirm the answer with sufficient confidence.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inaccurate Knowledge Retrieval:** The most critical bottleneck is the system's inability to reliably retrieve accurate information to answer questions. This could be caused by several factors, including a poorly indexed knowledge base, flawed search algorithms, or errors in the knowledge itself.\n*   **Insufficient Validation Mechanisms:** The system needs better validation mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of its answers. This includes cross-referencing information from multiple sources, applying logical reasoning to verify consistency, and having a mechanism for identifying potentially inaccurate information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary error pattern is consistently providing incorrect answers due to faulty knowledge retrieval. This suggests a deeper issue with how the system accesses and processes information.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is **inaccurate knowledge retrieval** leading to the generation of incorrect answers. This manifests in the system providing a different answer than the provided \"golden answer,\" which indicates an issue with the accuracy of the data the system accesses or the way it queries and interprets the data.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Knowledge Base Accuracy:** Rigorously audit and update the knowledge base used by the system to ensure its accuracy and completeness.\n*   **Information Retrieval Mechanisms:** Improve the information retrieval mechanisms to ensure that the system can accurately and efficiently access relevant information from the knowledge base. This may involve refining search algorithms, improving indexing strategies, or implementing more sophisticated query processing techniques.\n*   **Answer Validation:** Implement more robust answer validation techniques to verify the accuracy of the retrieved information before presenting it as the final answer. This may include cross-referencing information from multiple sources, applying logical reasoning to check for inconsistencies, and using external knowledge sources to confirm the answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement a Knowledge Graph:** Represent knowledge as a graph with entities and relationships. This can allow for more nuanced and context-aware information retrieval.\n*   **Improve Question Understanding:** Implement more sophisticated question understanding techniques, such as semantic parsing or dependency parsing, to extract the key entities and relations from the question.\n*   **Develop a Confidence Scoring System:** Assign a confidence score to each answer based on the quality and reliability of the retrieved information. Only present answers with a high confidence score. If confidence is low, provide an \"I don't know\" response or flag the answer for human review.\n*   **Implement External API Access:** Allow the system to access external APIs (e.g., Wikipedia, Google Search) to verify the accuracy of its answers and supplement its internal knowledge base.\n*   **Implement a \"Source Tracking\" Mechanism:** Keep track of the sources used to generate each answer, and allow users to review these sources.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis, improvement suggestions, capability mapping, and sample execution outputs provided.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a consistent pattern of failure.\n\n*   **\"Could not be validated\" (Sample ID 0):** This output indicates a significant breakdown in the system's ability to retrieve relevant information and validate a potential answer. It highlights a weakness not only in knowledge retrieval but also in the validation mechanisms themselves. The system is admitting it cannot produce a reliable answer, which is better than a confident, incorrect answer, but it still represents a failure to meet the user's need.\n*   **Incorrect Answers (Sample ID 1 & 2):**  The system consistently provides incorrect answers, even when it appears to extract some relevant information (as suggested by the \"partially failed\" information extraction in the capability mapping). This points towards problems with both knowledge retrieval and the reasoning applied to that knowledge.  The fact that explanations cite knowledge retrieval errors reinforces this point.\n*   **No Runtime Errors:** The absence of runtime errors suggests that the core code is functioning correctly, but the system's reasoning and knowledge access are flawed. This means the focus should be on improving the *logic* rather than debugging the *code*.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities in answering questions accurately. The overall accuracy of 0.00 (0/3) indicates a critical need for improvement. While the system *attempts* to provide answers, the high error rate makes it unreliable for real-world use. The system's willingness to return \"Could not be validated\" shows some self-awareness, but the goal is, of course, to answer correctly and confidently. The core issue lies in knowledge management, retrieval, and validation.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempting Answers:** The system attempts to answer questions rather than failing silently. This provides a starting point for refinement.\n*   **Explicit Failure Reporting (Validation):** The \"Could not be validated\" response shows an ability to recognize and report uncertainty, which is a valuable safety feature.\n* **Explanation Field:** The explanations are helpful in understanding *why* the errors occur, which facilitates targeted improvements.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Knowledge Retrieval:** The system demonstrably fails to retrieve the correct information from its knowledge base. This is the most prominent and impactful weakness.\n*   **Insufficient Validation:**  The system lacks robust validation mechanisms to ensure answer accuracy.  This includes cross-referencing, logical consistency checks, and external verification.\n*   **Poor Information Extraction:** The Capability Mapping highlights issues extracting even basic information from the question, leading to errors.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Inaccurate Knowledge Retrieval**. Addressing this weakness will have the largest positive impact on the system's overall performance. Specifically:\n\n*   **Improving the accuracy of the information in the knowledge base.**\n*   **Improving the query logic used to extract the correct answer from the knowledge base.**\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Knowledge Base Audit & Enhancement:**\n    *   **Action:** Conduct a thorough audit of the knowledge base used by the system.\n    *   **Details:**  Identify and correct any errors, inconsistencies, or gaps in the information.  Focus on the types of information required to answer the questions in the test dataset.  Consider adding more context and relationships between data points.\n    *   **Metrics:** Track the number of errors identified and corrected.\n\n2.  **Refine Information Retrieval Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Action:** Re-evaluate and refine the information retrieval mechanisms used by the system.\n    *   **Details:** Experiment with different search algorithms, indexing strategies, and query processing techniques. Use the sample questions as a guide. Implement more advanced query understanding such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Consider fuzzy matching for retrieval in case of misspellings or slight variations in terminology.\n    *   **Metrics:** Measure the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval using a held-out validation set.\n\n3.  **Implement a Confidence Scoring System and Enhanced Validation:**\n    *   **Action:**  Develop a confidence scoring system that assigns a score to each answer based on the quality and reliability of the retrieved information. Augment answer validation.\n    *   **Details:** Use the confidence score to determine whether to present the answer to the user, flag it for human review, or return an \"I don't know\" response. Strengthen validation mechanisms by implementing cross-referencing from multiple sources and logical reasoning checks.\n    *   **Metrics:** Track the accuracy of the confidence scoring system in predicting answer correctness. Monitor the frequency of \"I don't know\" responses and human reviews.\n\n4. **Implement the Knowledge Graph Recommendation.**\n    *   **Action:** Represent knowledge as a graph with entities and relationships.\n    *   **Details:** This can allow for more nuanced and context-aware information retrieval.\n    *   **Metrics:** Track performance improvement on the same tests.\n\n5. **Improve Question Understanding**\n    *   **Action:** Implement more sophisticated question understanding techniques, such as semantic parsing or dependency parsing, to extract the key entities and relations from the question.\n    *   **Details:** Use the same tests as a benchmark.\n    *   **Metrics:** Track performance improvement on the same tests.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the current accuracy of 0.00, the capability trend is **declining** or **stable**. Significant improvements are needed to reverse this trend. The success of the improvements should be measured by tracking the accuracy on the same (or similar) questions over time.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no explicit runtime errors (like JSONDecodeError or TypeError) present in the provided error cases. The errors seem to stem from incorrect reasoning and knowledge retrieval, rather than code execution failures.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   The system attempts to answer the questions.\n*   The system provides an answer, albeit incorrect, instead of simply failing.\n*   The explanation field provides a clear, understandable reason for why the system's answer is incorrect.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Knowledge Retrieval:** The system often retrieves incorrect information from its knowledge base or fails to locate the correct answer. This is evident in all error cases, where the system provides a different answer than the golden answer.\n*   **Validation Failure:** In one case, the system returns \"Could not be validated.\" This indicates a problem with the validation process, potentially due to a lack of relevant information or an inability to confirm the answer with sufficient confidence.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inaccurate Knowledge Retrieval:** The most critical bottleneck is the system's inability to reliably retrieve accurate information to answer questions. This could be caused by several factors, including a poorly indexed knowledge base, flawed search algorithms, or errors in the knowledge itself.\n*   **Insufficient Validation Mechanisms:** The system needs better validation mechanisms to ensure the accuracy of its answers. This includes cross-referencing information from multiple sources, applying logical reasoning to verify consistency, and having a mechanism for identifying potentially inaccurate information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary error pattern is consistently providing incorrect answers due to faulty knowledge retrieval. This suggests a deeper issue with how the system accesses and processes information.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is **inaccurate knowledge retrieval** leading to the generation of incorrect answers. This manifests in the system providing a different answer than the provided \"golden answer,\" which indicates an issue with the accuracy of the data the system accesses or the way it queries and interprets the data.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Knowledge Base Accuracy:** Rigorously audit and update the knowledge base used by the system to ensure its accuracy and completeness.\n*   **Information Retrieval Mechanisms:** Improve the information retrieval mechanisms to ensure that the system can accurately and efficiently access relevant information from the knowledge base. This may involve refining search algorithms, improving indexing strategies, or implementing more sophisticated query processing techniques.\n*   **Answer Validation:** Implement more robust answer validation techniques to verify the accuracy of the retrieved information before presenting it as the final answer. This may include cross-referencing information from multiple sources, applying logical reasoning to check for inconsistencies, and using external knowledge sources to confirm the answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement a Knowledge Graph:** Represent knowledge as a graph with entities and relationships. This can allow for more nuanced and context-aware information retrieval.\n*   **Improve Question Understanding:** Implement more sophisticated question understanding techniques, such as semantic parsing or dependency parsing, to extract the key entities and relations from the question.\n*   **Develop a Confidence Scoring System:** Assign a confidence score to each answer based on the quality and reliability of the retrieved information. Only present answers with a high confidence score. If confidence is low, provide an \"I don't know\" response or flag the answer for human review.\n*   **Implement External API Access:** Allow the system to access external APIs (e.g., Wikipedia, Google Search) to verify the accuracy of its answers and supplement its internal knowledge base.\n*   **Implement a \"Source Tracking\" Mechanism:** Keep track of the sources used to generate each answer, and allow users to review these sources. This can help users evaluate the reliability of the answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (could not extract enough information to provide a validated answer)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generated \"Could not be validated\" indicating an inability to generate a concrete answer)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (could not validate the answer)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially failed (extracted a name but the wrong one)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generated an incorrect name)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify the answer against other information to check that it was right)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially failed (extracted a name but the wrong one)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generated an incorrect name)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify the answer against other information to check that it was right)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis, improvement suggestions, capability mapping, and sample execution outputs provided.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a consistent pattern of failure.\n\n*   **\"Could not be validated\" (Sample ID 0):** This output indicates a significant breakdown in the system's ability to retrieve relevant information and validate a potential answer. It highlights a weakness not only in knowledge retrieval but also in the validation mechanisms themselves. The system is admitting it cannot produce a reliable answer, which is better than a confident, incorrect answer, but it still represents a failure to meet the user's need.\n*   **Incorrect Answers (Sample ID 1 & 2):**  The system consistently provides incorrect answers, even when it appears to extract some relevant information (as suggested by the \"partially failed\" information extraction in the capability mapping). This points towards problems with both knowledge retrieval and the reasoning applied to that knowledge.  The fact that explanations cite knowledge retrieval errors reinforces this point.\n*   **No Runtime Errors:** The absence of runtime errors suggests that the core code is functioning correctly, but the system's reasoning and knowledge access are flawed. This means the focus should be on improving the *logic* rather than debugging the *code*.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities in answering questions accurately. The overall accuracy of 0.00 (0/3) indicates a critical need for improvement. While the system *attempts* to provide answers, the high error rate makes it unreliable for real-world use. The system's willingness to return \"Could not be validated\" shows some self-awareness, but the goal is, of course, to answer correctly and confidently. The core issue lies in knowledge management, retrieval, and validation.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempting Answers:** The system attempts to answer questions rather than failing silently. This provides a starting point for refinement.\n*   **Explicit Failure Reporting (Validation):** The \"Could not be validated\" response shows an ability to recognize and report uncertainty, which is a valuable safety feature.\n* **Explanation Field:** The explanations are helpful in understanding *why* the errors occur, which facilitates targeted improvements.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Knowledge Retrieval:** The system demonstrably fails to retrieve the correct information from its knowledge base. This is the most prominent and impactful weakness.\n*   **Insufficient Validation:**  The system lacks robust validation mechanisms to ensure answer accuracy.  This includes cross-referencing, logical consistency checks, and external verification.\n*   **Poor Information Extraction:** The Capability Mapping highlights issues extracting even basic information from the question, leading to errors.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Inaccurate Knowledge Retrieval**. Addressing this weakness will have the largest positive impact on the system's overall performance. Specifically:\n\n*   **Improving the accuracy of the information in the knowledge base.**\n*   **Improving the query logic used to extract the correct answer from the knowledge base.**\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Knowledge Base Audit & Enhancement:**\n    *   **Action:** Conduct a thorough audit of the knowledge base used by the system.\n    *   **Details:**  Identify and correct any errors, inconsistencies, or gaps in the information.  Focus on the types of information required to answer the questions in the test dataset.  Consider adding more context and relationships between data points.\n    *   **Metrics:** Track the number of errors identified and corrected.\n\n2.  **Refine Information Retrieval Mechanisms:**\n    *   **Action:** Re-evaluate and refine the information retrieval mechanisms used by the system.\n    *   **Details:** Experiment with different search algorithms, indexing strategies, and query processing techniques. Use the sample questions as a guide. Implement more advanced query understanding such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Consider fuzzy matching for retrieval in case of misspellings or slight variations in terminology.\n    *   **Metrics:** Measure the accuracy and efficiency of information retrieval using a held-out validation set.\n\n3.  **Implement a Confidence Scoring System and Enhanced Validation:**\n    *   **Action:**  Develop a confidence scoring system that assigns a score to each answer based on the quality and reliability of the retrieved information. Augment answer validation.\n    *   **Details:** Use the confidence score to determine whether to present the answer to the user, flag it for human review, or return an \"I don't know\" response. Strengthen validation mechanisms by implementing cross-referencing from multiple sources and logical reasoning checks.\n    *   **Metrics:** Track the accuracy of the confidence scoring system in predicting answer correctness. Monitor the frequency of \"I don't know\" responses and human reviews.\n\n4. **Implement the Knowledge Graph Recommendation.**\n    *   **Action:** Represent knowledge as a graph with entities and relationships.\n    *   **Details:** This can allow for more nuanced and context-aware information retrieval.\n    *   **Metrics:** Track performance improvement on the same tests.\n\n5. **Improve Question Understanding**\n    *   **Action:** Implement more sophisticated question understanding techniques, such as semantic parsing or dependency parsing, to extract the key entities and relations from the question.\n    *   **Details:** Use the same tests as a benchmark.\n    *   **Metrics:** Track performance improvement on the same tests.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the current accuracy of 0.00, the capability trend is **declining** or **stable**. Significant improvements are needed to reverse this trend. The success of the improvements should be measured by tracking the accuracy on the same (or similar) questions over time.\n"

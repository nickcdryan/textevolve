Analyze the training examples below to\n    identify the transformation rule and apply it to the test input.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 8, 2, 2]]\n    Output Grid:\n    [[0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 8, 2, 2], [0, 0, 8, 2, 2]]\n    Reasoning: No transformation is apparent.

The `main` function formulates a prompt with examples and a test input, instructing the LLM (acting as an \"expert grid transformer\") to identify transformation rules and apply them. It then calls the `call_llm` function to send this prompt to the Gemini model and retrieve the transformed grid, which is then returned. The function names are `main` to generate the transformed grid and `call_llm` to use the Gemini API to process the prompt.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your request for a targeted, actionable assessment.\n\n**CAPABILITY REPORT: AI Grid Transformation System**\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs highlight a significant disconnect between the system's reasoning and the desired outcome. Here's a breakdown by sample:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**  The system provides a reasonable attempt at articulating a rule based on neighbor values.  However, the *golden answer is incorrect* as noted in the capability mapping. This throws off the entire learning process.  The generated grid is not correct.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The extracted rule (tiling a row) is a gross oversimplification of the underlying transformation. The resulting output is completely unrelated to a valid transformation. `solution_generation` uses the wrong pattern.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The described transformation is completely irrelevant to the original input. `information_extraction` is a failure. The dimensions have changed.\n\n**Patterns and Issues:**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Rule Extraction:** The dominant issue across all samples is the inability to derive the correct transformation rule. The interpretations are often based on superficial patterns rather than the fundamental underlying logic.\n*   **Brittle Logic:** The system lacks any form of error checking or adjustment. Once an incorrect rule is extracted, it is applied rigidly, leading to nonsensical results.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system appears to treat each grid as an isolated case, neglecting any potential relationships between different parts of the grid or potential high-level transformation operations.\n*   **Hallucination/Invented Rules:** The explanation for Sample ID 2 seems completely detached from reality and is inventing its own logic.\n*   **Incorrect Golden Answers:** the golden answers need validation, they are flawed.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nCurrently, the AI system demonstrates very limited capability in solving grid transformation problems.  While it *can* identify some superficial patterns and articulate them, it fails to accurately extract and apply the *correct* transformation logic. The overall accuracy of 0.00 (0/3) speaks to this. The system's ability to handle complex spatial reasoning and nuanced transformations is essentially non-existent.  The inclusion of invalid golden answers cripples the learning process.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Natural Language Articulation:** The system can express its (incorrect) understanding of the transformation rule in natural language.  This *could* be a strength if the understanding was accurate.\n*   **Grid Transformation application:** The system attempts to apply the extracted transformation rule to the test input to generate a transformed grid, however, it often fails.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition/Extraction:** This is the most critical weakness.  The system's inability to correctly identify the transformation rule undermines all subsequent steps.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:**  The system needs a more sophisticated spatial reasoning model.  It does not understand how elements relate to each other, or the effects of the transformations.\n*   **Data Validation:** There is no process to validate the golden answers for correctness.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition/Extraction**. Until the system can reliably extract the correct transformation rule, other improvements will have minimal impact.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Focus on Nearest Neighbors:** Refactor to *explicitly* find and use the nearest neighbors. The natural language description from Sample 0 makes it seem that there is an attempt to use nearest neighbors.\n    *   **Action:** Implement a `get_neighbors(grid, row, col)` function that returns a list of the values of all neighboring cells. Use this function within the transformation logic.  Ensure edge cases (cells on the borders of the grid) are handled correctly.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Provides a foundation for implementing transformations based on local context.\n2.  **Feature Representation Exploration:** Directly analyzing grids is insufficient; the system should extract meaningful features.\n    *   **Action:** Experiment with feature extraction techniques.  Consider extracting features like:\n        *   Number of distinct values in a row/column.\n        *   Presence of symmetrical patterns.\n        *   Connected components of the same value.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Can simplify the learning process by focusing on relevant information and reducing the complexity of the input.\n3.  **Implement a strict data validation procedure:** Ensure training example correctness.\n    *   **Action:** Validate the golden answers.\n    *   **Reasoning:** Inaccurate training examples degrade performance.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the provided information, the capability trend is **STABLE - VERY LOW**. The system consistently fails to extract and apply the correct transformation rules, and there's no indication of improvement across the samples. The system needs substantial improvements.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by leveraging LLM-driven analysis and generation through a series of functions. It decomposes the problem into question analysis, potential time generation, validation, and selection, each using the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini API. The overall workflow involves analyzing the meeting request, generating candidate times, validating those times against constraints, and then selecting the best available time. The main functions are: `main`, `analyze_question`, `generate_potential_times`, `validate_potential_times`, `select_best_time`, and `call_llm`, where the initial functions call upon one another to progress through the scheduling process with `call_llm` being the common LLM interaction function.",

The system attempts to find a suitable meeting time based on provided constraints, demonstrating a basic understanding of the scheduling task.\n2.  The system seems to be able to parse the input and identify participants and time constraints (implicit in the fact that it attempts to schedule at all).\n3.  The system provides a \"No suitable meeting time found\" response, indicating an attempt to process the schedule information even when a solution cannot be readily determined.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inability to find a feasible meeting time despite its existence.** The golden answers demonstrate that valid meeting times exist within the given constraints, indicating a flaw in the system's ability to identify them. The algorithm fails to correctly reason about the constraints and find the open slots.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Constraint Handling:** The system struggles to accurately apply complex constraints in scheduling problems involving multiple participants and schedule restrictions. It seems to miss available slots or incorrectly flags them as unavailable.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Scheduling Logic and Constraint Satisfaction:** The primary bottleneck is the scheduling logic itself. It appears the system's algorithm for finding available time slots and satisfying all participant constraints is inadequate. This could involve inefficient search, incorrect interpretation of constraints, or mishandling of overlapping busy times.\n2.  **Scalability with Participant Count:** The system seems to degrade in performance as the number of participants increases (Sample ID 2). This indicates that the scheduling algorithm may not scale efficiently to handle complex scenarios.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is failing to identify a valid meeting time even when one exists according to the golden answer. This suggests a systematic issue with the system's core scheduling logic or the way constraints are being processed. The system outputs \"No suitable meeting time found,\" despite the golden answer clearly indicating a time that satisfies all constraints.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inaccurate implementation of the scheduling algorithm**, which prevents the system from correctly identifying feasible meeting times given the provided participant schedules and constraints. The system's core logic for constraint satisfaction and time slot availability is flawed.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** Needs significant improvement in accurately interpreting and applying constraints, including busy times, preferred times, and limitations on certain days.\n2.  **Scheduling Algorithm:** Revamp the scheduling algorithm to be more robust and efficient, ensuring it can handle scenarios with multiple participants and complex time restrictions.\n3.  **Logic and Completeness in Search:** The completeness of the scheduling algorithm's search for available time slots should be validated.\n4. **Ability to find a solution.** The system should have a method of finding a solution, and not immediately returning if the first viable solution is not valid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a More Robust Scheduling Algorithm:** Replace the current scheduling logic with a well-established algorithm for meeting scheduling (e.g., constraint satisfaction, backtracking search).\n2.  **Constraint Representation:** Develop a more structured way to represent constraints internally, making it easier to reason about and apply them correctly. This could involve using a constraint programming library or a specialized data structure for representing time intervals.\n3.  **Testing and Validation:** Create a comprehensive set of test cases, including edge cases and complex scenarios, to rigorously validate the scheduling algorithm. Compare the results against known valid schedules to identify and fix errors.\n4. **Incorporate ReAct Pattern for Solution Generation:** Implement a ReAct loop where the agent reasons about available slots, proposes tentative solutions, checks for constraint violations, and adjusts the solution accordingly.\n5. **Implement a time availability class**. This class would have properties such as day of the week, start time, end time, duration and a method that validates if the meeting meets all constraints, returning a boolean.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (incorrectly verified that no solution exists)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (incorrectly verified the proposed solution)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (incorrectly verified that no solution exists)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, I will provide a comprehensive capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the Error Analysis Report. The system frequently declares \"No suitable meeting time found\" even when such a time exists (based on the golden answers). When a meeting time *is* proposed (Sample ID 1), it is not a valid one, further showcasing the limitations in logic.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   **Lack of Temporal Reasoning:** The system fails to perform adequate temporal reasoning.\n*   **Incorrect Constraint Validation:** It suggests the system's constraint validation is flawed as evidenced in Sample ID 1.\n*   **\"No Solution\" Bias:** A strong bias towards reporting \"No suitable meeting time found\" suggests a premature termination of the search for solutions, or a logic error that prevents feasible solutions from being identified.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a *very limited* capability in scheduling meetings. While it can parse inputs and identify participants and constraints, its core scheduling algorithm is highly unreliable. The low accuracy (40%) underscores the system's difficulty in finding feasible meeting times that satisfy all constraints. The system lacks the ability to validate its own answers, generating incorrect output.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Input Parsing:** The system demonstrates initial ability to parse the input and identify participants and constraints. While limited, this parsing is a vital part of the process.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Scheduling Logic & Constraint Satisfaction:** The core scheduling logic is fundamentally flawed, leading to a high rate of failure in identifying feasible meeting times. This is the *primary* obstacle to effective scheduling.\n*   **Incorrect Verification:** The system is unable to verify that proposed solutions are valid and that valid solutions that it should have found do exist.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe primary focus should be on improving the **Scheduling Logic & Constraint Satisfaction**. It is non-negotiable that the system finds valid results. An improvement in the efficiency of the scheduling logic should follow.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nBased on the identified weaknesses and the improvement focus, here are specific actions to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a New Scheduling Algorithm with ReAct:** Incorporate a ReAct pattern with the express goal of identifying a feasible schedule:\n    *   Reason: Analyze available slots for each participant.\n    *   Act: Propose a *tentative* meeting time.\n    *   Observe: Check for constraint violations (e.g., participant busy, outside working hours).\n    *   Repeat: If violations exist, *adjust the tentative meeting time and retry*. This iterative process is crucial. Include a `max_attempts` limiter.\n\n2.  **Constraint Representation:**\n    *   Define a `TimeAvailability` class or data structure with properties like `day_of_week`, `start_time`, `end_time`, and `duration`.\n    *   Implement a `validate_meeting(proposed_time)` method within this class to rigorously check all constraints.\n\n3.  **Systematic Testing:** Create a suite of test cases with known solutions to validate the ReAct implementation and the constraint validation logic.\n\n4.  **Few-Shot Learning:** Include 2-3 examples of correctly solved scheduling problems, demonstrating the ReAct reasoning process, in the initial prompt. These examples should cover different types of constraints and participant numbers.\n\n    **Example Few-Shot:**\n    ```\n    Problem: Schedule a meeting for John and Jane. John is busy Monday 9-11 and Tuesday 1-3. Jane is busy Monday 1-3 and Wednesday all day.\n    Thought 1: John is available Monday 1-5, Tuesday 9-1, Wednesday 9-5\n    Thought 2: Jane is available Monday 9-1, Tuesday 9-5, Wednesday Never.\n    Thought 3: Possible times are Monday 9-1, Tuesday 9-1, Wednesday Never.\n    Thought 4: Final Answer: Meeting can be schedule Monday 9-1\n    ```\n\n5.  **Error Tracking:** Log all intermediate steps of the scheduling process (tentative times, constraint violations, adjustments) to facilitate debugging.\n\n6.  **Implement a time availability class**. This class would have properties such as day of the week, start time, end time, duration and a method that validates if the meeting meets all constraints, returning a boolean.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable (Low)**. Without significant changes to the scheduling algorithm and constraint handling, the system will likely remain ineffective. The proposed changes are intended to reverse this trend towards significant improvement.\n",

The system's core logic for constraint satisfaction and time slot availability is flawed.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** Needs significant improvement in accurately interpreting and applying constraints, including busy times, preferred times, and limitations on certain days.\n2.  **Scheduling Algorithm:** Revamp the scheduling algorithm to be more robust and efficient, ensuring it can handle scenarios with multiple participants and complex time restrictions.\n3.  **Logic and Completeness in Search:** The completeness of the scheduling algorithm's search for available time slots should be validated.\n4. **Ability to find a solution.** The system should have a method of finding a solution, and not immediately returning if the first viable solution is not valid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a More Robust Scheduling Algorithm:** Replace the current scheduling logic with a well-established algorithm for meeting scheduling (e.g., constraint satisfaction, backtracking search).\n2.  **Constraint Representation:** Develop a more structured way to represent constraints internally, making it easier to reason about and apply them correctly. This could involve using a constraint programming library or a specialized data structure for representing time intervals.\n3.  **Testing and Validation:** Create a comprehensive set of test cases, including edge cases and complex scenarios, to rigorously validate the scheduling algorithm. Compare the results against known valid schedules to identify and fix errors.\n4. **Incorporate ReAct Pattern for Solution Generation:** Implement a ReAct loop where the agent reasons about available slots, proposes tentative solutions, checks for constraint violations, and adjusts the solution accordingly.\n5. **Implement a time availability class**. This class would have properties such as day of the week, start time, end time, duration and a method that validates if the meeting meets all constraints, returning a boolean.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (incorrectly verified that no solution exists)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (incorrectly verified the proposed solution)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (incorrectly verified that no solution exists)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, I will provide a comprehensive capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the Error Analysis Report. The system frequently declares \"No suitable meeting time found\" even when such a time exists (based on the golden answers). When a meeting time *is* proposed (Sample ID 1), it is not a valid one, further showcasing the limitations in logic.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   **Lack of Temporal Reasoning:** The system fails to perform adequate temporal reasoning.\n*   **Incorrect Constraint Validation:** It suggests the system's constraint validation is flawed as evidenced in Sample ID 1.\n*   **\"No Solution\" Bias:** A strong bias towards reporting \"No suitable meeting time found\" suggests a premature termination of the search for solutions, or a logic error that prevents feasible solutions from being identified.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a *very limited* capability in scheduling meetings. While it can parse inputs and identify participants and constraints, its core scheduling algorithm is highly unreliable. The low accuracy (40%) underscores the system's difficulty in finding feasible meeting times that satisfy all constraints. The system lacks the ability to validate its own answers, generating incorrect output.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Input Parsing:** The system demonstrates initial ability to parse the input and identify participants and constraints. While limited, this parsing is a vital part of the process.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Scheduling Logic & Constraint Satisfaction:** The core scheduling logic is fundamentally flawed, leading to a high rate of failure in identifying feasible meeting times. This is the *primary* obstacle to effective scheduling.\n*   **Incorrect Verification:** The system is unable to verify that proposed solutions are valid and that valid solutions that it should have found do exist.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe primary focus should be on improving the **Scheduling Logic & Constraint Satisfaction**. It is non-negotiable that the system finds valid results. An improvement in the efficiency of the scheduling logic should follow.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nBased on the identified weaknesses and the improvement focus, here are specific actions to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a New Scheduling Algorithm with ReAct:** Incorporate a ReAct pattern with the express goal of identifying a feasible schedule:\n    *   Reason: Analyze available slots for each participant.\n    *   Act: Propose a *tentative* meeting time.\n    *   Observe: Check for constraint violations (e.g., participant busy, outside working hours).\n    *   Repeat: If violations exist, *adjust the tentative meeting time and retry*. This iterative process is crucial. Include a `max_attempts` limiter.\n\n2.  **Constraint Representation:**\n    *   Define a `TimeAvailability` class or data structure with properties like `day_of_week`, `start_time`, `end_time`, and `duration`.\n    *   Implement a `validate_meeting(proposed_time)` method within this class to rigorously check all constraints.\n\n3.  **Systematic Testing:** Create a suite of test cases with known solutions to validate the ReAct implementation and the constraint validation logic.\n\n4.  **Few-Shot Learning:** Include 2-3 examples of correctly solved scheduling problems, demonstrating the ReAct reasoning process, in the initial prompt. These examples should cover different types of constraints and participant numbers.\n\n    **Example Few-Shot:**\n    ```\n    Problem: Schedule a meeting for John and Jane. John is busy Monday 9-11 and Tuesday 1-3. Jane is busy Monday 1-3 and Wednesday all day.\n    Thought 1: John is available Monday 1-5, Tuesday 9-1, Wednesday 9-5\n    Thought 2: Jane is available Monday 9-1, Tuesday 9-5, Wednesday Never.\n    Thought 3: Possible times are Monday 9-1, Tuesday 9-1, Wednesday Never.\n    Thought 4: Final Answer: Meeting can be schedule Monday 9-1\n    ```\n\n5.  **Error Tracking:** Log all intermediate steps of the scheduling process (tentative times, constraint violations, adjustments) to facilitate debugging.\n\n6.  **Implement a time availability class**. This class would have properties such as day of the week, start time, end time, duration and a method that validates if the meeting meets all constraints, returning a boolean.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable (Low)**. Without significant changes to the scheduling algorithm and constraint handling, the system will likely remain ineffective. The proposed changes are intended to reverse this trend towards significant improvement.\n"

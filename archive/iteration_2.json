  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by first analyzing constraints, extracting participants and schedules, and then using the ReAct pattern to find a solution. It decomposes the problem into constraint analysis, participant extraction, schedule extraction, and solution generation using the `analyze_constraints_with_verification`, `extract_participants_with_verification`, and `extract_schedules_with_verification` functions, respectively. The \"Constraint Analyzer\" agent identifies and structures constraints. These functions all call the `call_llm` function, which interfaces with the Gemini LLM, incorporating verification loops to ensure data accuracy and integrity before `solve_with_react_pattern` is called. Finally, `solve_with_react_pattern` uses an LLM as a scheduling agent that iteratively reasons and acts to generate a proposed meeting schedule.",

You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amanda and Nathan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nAmanda is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nNathan is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nAmanda do not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00. Nathan can not meet on Monday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: "

Specifically, the `configure` method is not found within the `google.genai` module, suggesting an issue with the installation, import, or version of the `google-generativeai` library. This configuration issue prevents the system from properly accessing and utilizing the LLM, leading to a complete failure in processing the scheduling tasks.\nAdditionally, a secondary error is observed:\n\n*   `JSON Decode Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`\n\nThis JSONDecodeError typically arises when the system attempts to parse an empty string or a non-JSON formatted string as JSON. The error occurs after the Gemini API call fails, implying that the system receives an empty or invalid response from the LLM due to the API configuration issue. Because of this, the empty response causes the json parsing to fail.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Problem Definition:** The system receives well-defined scheduling problems with explicit constraints.\n2.  **Structured Input:** The input data is structured, including participant schedules and meeting requirements.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Reliance on External API without Proper Error Handling:** The system critically depends on the Google Gemini API. When the API is not properly configured, the entire process fails. The error handling is insufficient, as the system reports a generic \"Failed to analyze constraints\" error instead of a specific API configuration problem.\n2.  **Brittle JSON Parsing:** The system expects responses in a specific JSON format. The JSONDecodeError suggests the system doesn't robustly handle cases where the LLM doesn't return valid JSON, possibly due to the API configuration error or unexpected LLM behavior.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **API Configuration:** The inability to properly configure the Google Gemini API is the primary bottleneck.\n2.  **Lack of Robustness:** The system's brittle error handling causes total failure when the external API fails or returns unexpected data.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **API Configuration Failure:** The \"module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'\" error appears consistently in all error cases.\n2.  **Cascade of Errors:** The API configuration failure triggers a JSONDecodeError, as the subsequent processing steps rely on the API's output.\n3.  **Generic Error Message:** The system consistently returns the same generic error message, \"Error: Failed to analyze constraints after multiple attempts,\" regardless of the underlying cause.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **failure to properly configure and access the Google Gemini API**, leading to a cascade of errors and a complete inability to solve the scheduling problems. The root cause is the \"module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'\" error, which needs to be addressed directly.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **API Configuration and Error Handling:** Implement robust API configuration checks and error handling. The system should verify the API's availability and configuration before attempting to use it. Specific exceptions related to API access or configuration should be caught and handled gracefully.\n2.  **Robust JSON Parsing:** Implement more robust JSON parsing with fallback mechanisms. The system should validate the LLM's output before attempting to parse it as JSON and provide helpful error messages if the data does not conform to the expected format.\n3.  **Specific Error Reporting:** The system should provide more specific and informative error messages. The \"Failed to analyze constraints\" message is too generic and doesn't provide any insight into the underlying problem.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement API Configuration Check:** Add a function that explicitly checks for the existence and correct configuration of the `google.genai` module and its `configure` method *before* any scheduling logic is executed.\n2.  **Wrap API Calls in Try-Except Blocks:** Surround all calls to the Google Gemini API with try-except blocks that catch specific exceptions related to API access and configuration (e.g., `AttributeError`, `ImportError`, `google.generativeai.APIError`).\n3.  **Implement JSON Validation:** Add a step to validate the structure and data types of the JSON response from the LLM *before* attempting to process it. Use a library like `jsonschema` to define the expected schema and validate the response. If the validation fails, log the error and handle the exception gracefully.\n4.  **Provide More Specific Error Messages:** Replace the generic \"Failed to analyze constraints\" message with more specific error messages that indicate the underlying cause of the failure (e.g., \"API configuration error\", \"Invalid JSON response from API\").\n5.  **Implement a Fallback Mechanism:** If the API configuration fails or the JSON response is invalid, implement a fallback mechanism that attempts to solve the problem using a different approach or returns a more informative error message to the user.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** All capabilities failed due to API configuration error: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** All capabilities failed due to API configuration error: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** All capabilities failed due to API configuration error: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making.\n*   **Sample ID 3:** All capabilities failed due to API configuration error: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making.\n*   **Sample ID 4:** All capabilities failed due to API configuration error: information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making.\n",

It is unable to perform any of the core tasks required for scheduling, including information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, or solution verification. The system's reliance on a properly configured external API without adequate error handling makes it extremely fragile.\",\n    \"key_strengths\": [\n      \"Clear problem definition in input data.\",\n      \"Structured input format.\"\n    ],\n    \"key_weaknesses\": [\n      \"Critical dependency on external API without proper configuration verification.\",\n      \"Insufficient error handling, resulting in generic error messages and cascading failures.\",\n      \"Brittle JSON parsing that cannot handle unexpected or malformed API responses.\"\n    ],\n    \"improvement_focus\": \"The most critical capability to improve is **API Configuration and Robust Error Handling**.

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using a chain of LLM calls to extract constraints, propose a meeting time, and verify the solution. `extract_meeting_constraints` extracts meeting details from a question; `propose_meeting_time` suggests a time based on those constraints; and `verify_solution` checks if the proposed time is valid given the original question, with each function using few-shot learning. The `main` function orchestrates this process. Function flow: `main` calls `extract_meeting_constraints`, then `propose_meeting_time`, followed by `verify_solution`, and relies on `call_llm` for LLM interactions in each step.",

The system struggles to correctly interpret and apply all the constraints related to participant availability and time preferences, resulting in the selection of invalid meeting times.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Needs significant improvement to correctly process and apply scheduling constraints.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Improve the solution verification process to ensure that the proposed time slot adheres to all constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a detailed constraint checking function:** Create a function that explicitly checks each potential time slot against all participant schedules and specified constraints. This function should return `True` only if the time slot is valid for all participants and satisfies all constraints.\n2.  **Use a structured data format for schedules:** Convert the text-based schedules into a structured data format (e.g., a dictionary or a list of time intervals) to facilitate easier and more accurate constraint checking. This data structure should make it easy to check for conflicts, find available time slots.\n3.  **Implement a verification loop:** After generating a proposed time slot, implement a verification step that explicitly checks the proposed time slot against all constraints.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and following the requested format:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly demonstrate the core issues identified in the error analysis.  The proposed times for samples 1 and 2 are invalid based on the provided constraints:\n*   **Sample 1:** Proposes Monday even though Barbara would rather not meet on Tuesday.\n*   **Sample 2:** Proposes 9:30 - 10:30, when Madison and Kathleen are busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30 and Samuel is busy on 9:30 to 12:30.\n\nThe outputs are structured consistently (ANSWER_START/END tags), but the *content* within those tags is unreliable.  The system states it's a \"proposed time\", but the provided output violates constraints.  The deterministic scheduling issue is very apparent.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses a *rudimentary* ability to identify the need for a meeting. However, it demonstrates a *critical deficiency* in translating constraints into valid schedules.  The core scheduling logic is demonstrably broken, even for relatively simple constraints. The verification process is non-existent or ineffective. Overall, the system has very limited scheduling capabilities.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic intent recognition:** It correctly identifies that a meeting needs to be scheduled.\n*   **Output structuring:** The output format is consistent (though misleading).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Processing:**  Failure to correctly interpret and apply scheduling constraints.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Inability to verify if the proposed solution satisfies all the constraints.\n*   **Deterministic Scheduling:** Inability to reliably schedule the correct time that has been predetermined in the golden answers.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:**  The system likely breaks down with more complex or numerous constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Constraint Processing:** This is the single most critical capability to improve.  Without accurate constraint processing, the entire system is fundamentally flawed. Deterministic Scheduling will follow constraint processing.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust Constraint Checking Module:**\n    *   Create a dedicated module (a Python class or set of functions) specifically for constraint checking.\n    *   This module should take as input: a proposed time slot, a structured representation of participant schedules, and a set of constraints.\n    *   It should return a boolean value indicating whether the time slot is valid, along with a list of any constraint violations.\n2.  **Data Structure Transformation:**\n    *   Design code to transform text-based schedules into well-structured data representation.\n    *   Use structured data representation as inputs to your constraint checking module.\n3.  **Integrate Verification Loop:**\n    *   After generating a proposed time slot, use the constraint checking module to *explicitly verify* that the time slot is valid.\n    *   If violations are found, implement a *search strategy* (e.g., iterative refinement, backtracking) to find a valid time slot, or report failure after a reasonable number of attempts (use `max_attempts`).\n4.  **Structured Output with Validation:**\n    *   After the time is determined to be a valid and working answer, validate that the time exists in the user specified schedule. If not, restart with a different time.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is **stable, but at a very low level**. The system consistently fails on constraint handling, indicating that the core logic remains unchanged and ineffective. Without significant improvements to constraint processing and solution verification, the system will remain largely unusable.\n",

The system struggles to correctly interpret and apply all the constraints related to participant availability and time preferences, resulting in the selection of invalid meeting times.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Needs significant improvement to correctly process and apply scheduling constraints.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Improve the solution verification process to ensure that the proposed time slot adheres to all constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a detailed constraint checking function:** Create a function that explicitly checks each potential time slot against all participant schedules and specified constraints. This function should return `True` only if the time slot is valid for all participants and satisfies all constraints.\n2.  **Use a structured data format for schedules:** Convert the text-based schedules into a structured data format (e.g., a dictionary or a list of time intervals) to facilitate easier and more accurate constraint checking. This data structure should make it easy to check for conflicts, find available time slots.\n3.  **Implement a verification loop:** After generating a proposed time slot, implement a verification step that explicitly checks the proposed time slot against all constraints. If the verification fails, the system should attempt to find an alternative time slot or refine the search process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed. Barbara would rather not meet on Tuesday, however, the initial search prioritized a time on Monday over Wednesday.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed.\n    *   decision_making: Failed.\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed. Madison has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 14:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00; \\nCheryl's calendar is wide open the entire day.\\nWalter's calendar is wide open the entire day.\\nDonna is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 11:00, 11:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 17:00; \\nKathleen has meetings on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 15:00, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \\nSamuel has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 17:00.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed.\n    *   decision_making: Failed.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and following the requested format:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly demonstrate the core issues identified in the error analysis.  The proposed times for samples 1 and 2 are invalid based on the provided constraints:\n*   **Sample 1:** Proposes Monday even though Barbara would rather not meet on Tuesday.\n*   **Sample 2:** Proposes 9:30 - 10:30, when Madison and Kathleen are busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30 and Samuel is busy on 9:30 to 12:30.\n\nThe outputs are structured consistently (ANSWER_START/END tags), but the *content* within those tags is unreliable.  The system states it's a \"proposed time\", but the provided output violates constraints.  The deterministic scheduling issue is very apparent.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses a *rudimentary* ability to identify the need for a meeting. However, it demonstrates a *critical deficiency* in translating constraints into valid schedules.  The core scheduling logic is demonstrably broken, even for relatively simple constraints. The verification process is non-existent or ineffective. Overall, the system has very limited scheduling capabilities.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic intent recognition:** It correctly identifies that a meeting needs to be scheduled.\n*   **Output structuring:** The output format is consistent (though misleading).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Processing:**  Failure to correctly interpret and apply scheduling constraints.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Inability to verify if the proposed solution satisfies all the constraints.\n*   **Deterministic Scheduling:** Inability to reliably schedule the correct time that has been predetermined in the golden answers.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:**  The system likely breaks down with more complex or numerous constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Constraint Processing:** This is the single most critical capability to improve.  Without accurate constraint processing, the entire system is fundamentally flawed. Deterministic Scheduling will follow constraint processing.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust Constraint Checking Module:**\n    *   Create a dedicated module (a Python class or set of functions) specifically for constraint checking.\n    *   This module should take as input: a proposed time slot, a structured representation of participant schedules, and a set of constraints.\n    *   It should return a boolean value indicating whether the time slot is valid, along with a list of any constraint violations.\n2.  **Data Structure Transformation:**\n    *   Design code to transform text-based schedules into well-structured data representation.\n    *   Use structured data representation as inputs to your constraint checking module.\n3.  **Integrate Verification Loop:**\n    *   After generating a proposed time slot, use the constraint checking module to *explicitly verify* that the time slot is valid.\n    *   If violations are found, implement a *search strategy* (e.g., iterative refinement, backtracking) to find a valid time slot, or report failure after a reasonable number of attempts (use `max_attempts`).\n4.  **Structured Output with Validation:**\n    *   After the time is determined to be a valid and working answer, validate that the time exists in the user specified schedule. If not, restart with a different time.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is **stable, but at a very low level**. The system consistently fails on constraint handling, indicating that the core logic remains unchanged and ineffective. Without significant improvements to constraint processing and solution verification, the system will remain largely unusable.\n"

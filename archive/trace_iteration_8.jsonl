The Patriots played from behind for the rest of the game and could not catch up to the Colts. Patriots QB Tom Brady was intercepted four times in the defeat, and Colts LB Cato June intercepted two of those passes. Also of note, Colts WR Marvin Harrison had 8 catches in the game for 145 yards and two touchdowns. The victory marked the Colts' second straight versus the Patriots after having lost the previous six. With the win, the Colts became just the second team in NFL history to begin consecutive seasons 8-0 (the Green Bay Packers began three consecutive seasons 8-0 from 1929 to 1931).

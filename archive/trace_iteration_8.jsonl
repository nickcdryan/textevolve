The rest of the rows become rows of zeros, except rows 2 and 3.\n\nBased on these observations, the transformation rule is:\n\n1.  Identify two adjacent rows containing non-zero elements.\n2.  Mirror the contents of these rows around a horizontal axis, specifically, row `i` swaps with row `i+1`. The new row `i` becomes the old row `i+1` and new row `i+1` becomes the old row `i`.\n3.  Set all other rows in the grid to be rows of zeros.\n\nNow, apply this rule to the test input:\n\nInput Grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nRows 0 and 1 have values, so we'll mirror them. The top two rows swap positions. All other rows become zero-filled.\n\nOutput Grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n    Is the rule valid?

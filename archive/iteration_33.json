  "approach_summary": "The script implements a \"Knowledge Source Navigator with Chain-of-Verification\" approach to answer questions using an LLM. It decomposes the problem into sequential steps: generating a search query, retrieving information, extracting the answer, and validating the answer, using an LLM as a tool in each step. Each step uses a specific agent role (search query generator, search engine simulator, answer extractor, and fact validator) via prompting with multiple few-shot examples. The core functions used are `generate_search_query`, `retrieve_info`, `extract_answer`, and `validate_answer`, which sequentially refine the LLM's output to produce a validated answer to the input question; these all rely on the `call_llm` function which executes the requests from the google/genai API.",

    "error_analysis": {
      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNone found in the provided error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Effective Query Generation:** The system demonstrates an ability to formulate relevant search queries based on the questions. This is evident in all error cases, where the generated queries are directly related to the information sought.\n2.  **Information Extraction:** The system can successfully extract information from the retrieved search results. It correctly identifies key entities and relationships mentioned in the text, even though the extracted answer may not always be the correct one.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Reliance on Single Source:** The system seems to rely heavily on the first piece of information it retrieves, without cross-referencing or validating it against other sources. This makes it vulnerable to inaccuracies or ambiguities present in the initial retrieved information.\n2.  **Lack of Disambiguation:** The system struggles to disambiguate information, particularly when multiple entities share similar names or descriptions (as seen in sample\\_id 0).\n3.  **Inadequate Validation:** Despite having a \"Validation result\" field, the validation process is clearly flawed. The system incorrectly marks incorrect answers as \"VALID\" (sample\\_id 1 and 2). This indicates a serious problem in how the system verifies its extracted answers.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Insufficient Answer Validation:** The current validation mechanism is ineffective and prone to errors. It fails to identify incorrect answers as invalid, leading to the selection of wrong solutions.\n2.  **Over-Reliance on Initial Search Result:** The system's tendency to accept the first piece of information without further verification creates a single point of failure. This makes it susceptible to inaccuracies or incomplete information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Validation Flag:** The validation flag is often incorrect, labeling wrong answers as \"VALID\". This is a crucial error that directly contributes to incorrect final answers.\n2.  **No Cross-Referencing:** The system appears to extract information from a single source without cross-referencing or verifying it against other potential sources found in the search results.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **flawed answer validation process**. The system incorrectly flags incorrect answers as \"VALID\", leading to the acceptance and selection of wrong solutions. This suggests a deficiency in the logic and criteria used for validating the extracted information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Answer Validation:** The validation process needs a complete overhaul. It should incorporate more robust checks, including comparing the extracted information against multiple sources, verifying numerical values, and considering contextual information.\n2.  **Disambiguation:** Implement mechanisms to disambiguate entities and information, especially when dealing with similar names or descriptions. This could involve analyzing context, considering alternative sources, and using knowledge bases.\n3.  **Source Reliability:** Evaluate the reliability and credibility of different sources. Prioritize information from authoritative sources and be cautious of information from less reliable sources.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Source Validation Strategy:** After retrieving information, the system should consult multiple sources to confirm the extracted answer. This involves scraping information from multiple web pages linked in the initial search results and comparing the information.\n2.  **Develop a Rule-Based Validation System:** Create a set of rules to validate extracted answers based on the question type and context. For example, if the question asks for a numerical value, the system should verify that the extracted answer is indeed a number and within a reasonable range.\n3.  **Incorporate a Disambiguation Module:** Implement a module that can identify and resolve ambiguities in the retrieved information. This could involve using techniques like named entity recognition (NER) and co-reference resolution.\n4.  **Implement a scoring mechanism for retrieved sources:** Rank sources by reliability and use the scores to weight the extracted answers. This could involve factors like domain authority, publication date, and user reviews.\n5.  **Introduce more specific error messages.** If the validation fails, add a reason as to why it failed. This helps diagnose validation issues.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (Extracted the wrong individual)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (Did not identify incorrect answer)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (Chose incorrect answer)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Worked but the information was incorrect in the first place\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (Incorrectly marked wrong answer as valid)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (Chose incorrect answer)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Worked but the information was incorrect in the first place\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (Incorrectly marked wrong answer as valid)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (Chose incorrect answer)\n",

Sample ID 1 and 2 show incorrect answers marked as \"VALID.\" This invalidates the entire answer selection process.\n*   **Superficial Information Extraction:** The system seems to extract information verbatim without deeper understanding or critical assessment. In Sample ID 2, it extracts \"Four\" as the answer without confirming whether this refers to siblings of *Elizabeth Spencer*. The raw retrieved information lacks specifics, but the system fails to recognize this gap.\n*   **Limited Contextual Understanding:** The failure to disambiguate \"Tom Wopat\" in Sample ID 0, when the search query clearly asks for a *guest star* in the *The Dukes of Hazzard*, highlights a lack of contextual understanding. The system grabs the first piece of information relating to \"Tom Wopat\" without considering the broader query.\n*   **Reliance on First Search Result:** The system consistently relies on the first piece of information retrieved, as evidenced in all samples. This makes it highly vulnerable to inaccuracies, incomplete information, and misleading answers presented early in the search results.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The report shows no graceful error handling when information is missing or ambiguous. Instead, the system attempts to produce an answer even with flawed information, resulting in incorrect results.\n*   **Query Effectiveness:** The search queries themselves are well-formulated, indicating a strength in understanding the intent of the question. However, this strength is undermined by the flawed downstream processes.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates *very low capability* in providing accurate answers. While it shows potential in query generation and initial information extraction, its inability to validate and critically assess information renders it largely ineffective. The accuracy rate of 0.00 (0/3) confirms a critical need for improvement.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Effective Query Generation:** The ability to formulate relevant search queries remains a valuable asset. This provides a solid foundation upon which to build more robust downstream processes.\n*   **Basic Information Extraction:** The system can pull out key entities and relationships from text.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Flawed Answer Validation:** The current validation process is fundamentally broken and represents the most significant bottleneck.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Initial Search Result:** The lack of cross-referencing and validation against multiple sources makes the system highly susceptible to inaccuracies.\n*   **Lack of Disambiguation:** The inability to differentiate between similar entities or interpret context leads to incorrect answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Answer Validation**. A reliable validation mechanism is essential for ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of the system's responses. Without proper validation, even accurate information extraction will lead to incorrect answers.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Redesign the Validation Process:**\n    *   **Implement a Multi-Source Confirmation Step:**  After extracting an answer, actively search for the same information from at least two other independent sources identified in the search results. Only validate as \"VALID\" if the information matches across multiple sources.\n    *   **Introduce a Confidence Score:** Instead of a binary \"VALID/INVALID\" flag, assign a confidence score to the answer based on factors like source reliability (see below), number of confirming sources, and the presence of conflicting information.  Only present answers with a confidence score above a defined threshold.\n    *   **Implement Rule-Based Validation Checks:** Create a set of rules based on the question type. For example:\n        *   *Numerical answers:* Verify that the extracted answer is a number and check if it falls within a reasonable range based on common sense or external knowledge.\n        *   *Date answers:* Confirm that the extracted answer is a valid date.\n        *   *Entity answers:* Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to verify that the extracted answer is of the correct entity type (e.g., person, location, organization).\n2.  **Enhance Source Reliability Assessment:**\n    *   **Implement a Source Ranking System:** Develop a scoring system for retrieved sources based on factors like domain authority, website reputation (using external APIs or databases), publication date (prioritizing more recent information), and user reviews (if available).\n    *   **Prioritize Authoritative Sources:** Give higher weight to information from sources deemed more authoritative.\n3.  **Improve Disambiguation Capabilities:**\n    *   **Implement Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Co-reference Resolution:** Use NER to identify and classify entities in the question and the retrieved information. Use co-reference resolution to track references to the same entity throughout the text.\n    *   **Contextual Analysis:** Before extracting the final answer, analyze the surrounding context to ensure that the extracted information is relevant to the specific question.  Use techniques like semantic similarity to compare the meaning of the question and the extracted answer.\n    *   **Knowledge Base Integration:** Integrate a knowledge base (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia) to help disambiguate entities and provide additional information about them.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0% accuracy), the capability trend is currently **declining** or at best **stable at a very low level**.  Significant improvements in the validation process are crucial to reverse this trend.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNone found in the provided error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Effective Query Generation:** The system demonstrates an ability to formulate relevant search queries based on the questions. This is evident in all error cases, where the generated queries are directly related to the information sought.\n2.  **Information Extraction:** The system can successfully extract information from the retrieved search results. It correctly identifies key entities and relationships mentioned in the text, even though the extracted answer may not always be the correct one.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Reliance on Single Source:** The system seems to rely heavily on the first piece of information it retrieves, without cross-referencing or validating it against other sources. This makes it vulnerable to inaccuracies or ambiguities present in the initial retrieved information.\n2.  **Lack of Disambiguation:** The system struggles to disambiguate information, particularly when multiple entities share similar names or descriptions (as seen in sample\\_id 0).\n3.  **Inadequate Validation:** Despite having a \"Validation result\" field, the validation process is clearly flawed. The system incorrectly marks incorrect answers as \"VALID\" (sample\\_id 1 and 2). This indicates a serious problem in how the system verifies its extracted answers.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Insufficient Answer Validation:** The current validation mechanism is ineffective and prone to errors. It fails to identify incorrect answers as invalid, leading to the selection of wrong solutions.\n2.  **Over-Reliance on Initial Search Result:** The system's tendency to accept the first piece of information without further verification creates a single point of failure. This makes it susceptible to inaccuracies or incomplete information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Validation Flag:** The validation flag is often incorrect, labeling wrong answers as \"VALID\". This is a crucial error that directly contributes to incorrect final answers.\n2.  **No Cross-Referencing:** The system appears to extract information from a single source without cross-referencing or verifying it against other potential sources found in the search results.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **flawed answer validation process**. The system incorrectly flags incorrect answers as \"VALID\", leading to the acceptance and selection of wrong solutions. This suggests a deficiency in the logic and criteria used for validating the extracted information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Answer Validation:** The validation process needs a complete overhaul. It should incorporate more robust checks, including comparing the extracted information against multiple sources, verifying numerical values, and considering contextual information.\n2.  **Disambiguation:** Implement mechanisms to disambiguate entities and information, especially when dealing with similar names or descriptions. This could involve analyzing context, considering alternative sources, and using knowledge bases.\n3.  **Source Reliability:** Evaluate the reliability and credibility of different sources. Prioritize information from authoritative sources and be cautious of information from less reliable sources.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Source Validation Strategy:** After retrieving information, the system should consult multiple sources to confirm the extracted answer. This involves scraping information from multiple web pages linked in the initial search results and comparing the information.\n2.  **Develop a Rule-Based Validation System:** Create a set of rules to validate extracted answers based on the question type and context. For example, if the question asks for a numerical value, the system should verify that the extracted answer is indeed a number and within a reasonable range.\n3.  **Incorporate a Disambiguation Module:** Implement a module that can identify and resolve ambiguities in the retrieved information. This could involve using techniques like named entity recognition (NER) and co-reference resolution.\n4.  **Implement a scoring mechanism for retrieved sources:** Rank sources by reliability and use the scores to weight the extracted answers. This could involve factors like domain authority, publication date, and user reviews.\n5.  **Introduce more specific error messages.** If the validation fails, add a reason as to why it failed. This helps diagnose validation issues.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (Extracted the wrong individual)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (Did not identify incorrect answer)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (Chose incorrect answer)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Worked but the information was incorrect in the first place\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (Incorrectly marked wrong answer as valid)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (Chose incorrect answer)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Worked but the information was incorrect in the first place\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (Incorrectly marked wrong answer as valid)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (Chose incorrect answer)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your specifications.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues, primarily related to the validation and information retrieval process.\n\n*   **Incorrect Validation:** The \"Validation result\" field is highly unreliable. Sample ID 1 and 2 show incorrect answers marked as \"VALID.\" This invalidates the entire answer selection process.\n*   **Superficial Information Extraction:** The system seems to extract information verbatim without deeper understanding or critical assessment. In Sample ID 2, it extracts \"Four\" as the answer without confirming whether this refers to siblings of *Elizabeth Spencer*. The raw retrieved information lacks specifics, but the system fails to recognize this gap.\n*   **Limited Contextual Understanding:** The failure to disambiguate \"Tom Wopat\" in Sample ID 0, when the search query clearly asks for a *guest star* in the *The Dukes of Hazzard*, highlights a lack of contextual understanding. The system grabs the first piece of information relating to \"Tom Wopat\" without considering the broader query.\n*   **Reliance on First Search Result:** The system consistently relies on the first piece of information retrieved, as evidenced in all samples.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a \"Transformation by Analogy and Iterative Refinement\" strategy to solve grid transformation problems. It decomposes the problem into identifying an analogous transformation from a set of known types (Element Expansion, Diagonal Placement, Value Replacement, Grid Reversal), applying the transformation, and iteratively refining the result. The agent role is that of an expert at grid transformation. The script uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model and obtain responses based on specific prompts; `solve_grid_transformation` drives the iterative solving process; `main` calls the `solve_grid_transformation` function. The workflow involves first identifying an analogous transformation, then applying it to generate a transformed grid, and finally refining the grid iteratively to correct any errors.",

      "answer": "Okay, I see the problem. My refined transformation pattern is still not correct. The transformation is more complex than just adding columns with the repeated value. It appears there is a rearrangement and duplication of values going on.\n\nLet's look at the training examples again and try to understand the logic behind the transformation.\n\n**Re-analyzing Training Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The '2's in the row are being translated into a diagonal pattern. Essentially the column containing '2' has become a diagonal with '1' in one case and zero otherwise.\n*   **Example 2:** The '8's in the row become a block-diagonal pattern.\n*   **Example 3:** The '4's in the row become a block-diagonal pattern.\n\n**Revised Transformation Pattern Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Row and Value:**  Find the row with repeated values and identify that repeated value. Let's call that value 'X'.\n2.  **Locate the Position of 'X':** Find the column index 'C' of 'X' in the original input grid.\n3.  **Create an Output Grid:**  The output grid has dimensions related to the number of times 'X' appears in its original row. It transforms column 'C' to a kind of block-diagonal of a new grid where 'X' populates it. The dimensions of the new grid corresponds to how many times 'X' occurred in the original row.\n\nThis is still hard to articulate concisely. Let me focus on how to get the output grid from the input.\n\n**Let's look at example 1 to solidify the Logic**\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nRow 6 is the repeated row with value 2.  Column 6 in the input matrix is the critical column containing the repeated value.\nThe target grid is 10x10, not 11x11 related to the size of the repeating row.\n\nFrom examples 2 and 3, one may surmise that other columns that also contain value `X` from the row containing repeated `X` values are also part of the output generation.\n\nI need to rethink the pattern entirely.\n\n**Back to Basics - Visual Pattern Matching**\n\nOkay, clearly I'm struggling to reverse engineer the logic. Let's try a purely visual pattern-matching approach. I'll focus on how the *shapes* of the numbers change.\n\n*   **Example 1 (2):** The column of 2's becomes a kind of \"X\" shape, but with a gap in the middle.\n*   **Example 2 (8):** The column of 8's splits and spreads out horizontally from center.\n*   **Example 3 (4):** The column of 4's spreads and makes a square.\n\n**Trying this visual analogy on the test input:**\n\nThe key row is row 6, the key number is 3. The column containing repeated 3 values is column 7. Let's look at other columns which also contain value 3 - there are none. So column 7 in the input is the 'active' column. The visual transformation applied to the 3's in column 7 seems to be to become \"horizontal bars above and below the center\".\n\nPredicted Grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nThis is also not close, the dimension has changed from 13x13 to 13x13, which is impossible.\nI am going to give up.\n```text\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```",
      "output": "Extracted Analogy: Okay, let's analyze the training examples to identify the transformation pattern and then apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Training Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**  The '2's along the diagonal in the Input Grid are replaced by zeros in the Output Grid, except for the element at \\[5,5], which becomes 0. The other '2' values become a zero. All the values in the original grid at index\\[x,5] and \\[5,x] are transformed.\n\n*   **Example 2:** The '8's along the diagonal in the Input Grid are replaced by zeros in the Output Grid. The '3' elements are replaced with '8's and vice versa along the edge and the diagonal\n\n*   **Example 3:** The '4's along the diagonal in the Input Grid are replaced by zeros in the Output Grid. The '2' elements are replaced with '4's and vice versa along the edge and the diagonal.\n\nBased on these observations, the transformation pattern appears to be:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"diagonal\" elements:** Find the row in the Input Grid that is almost entirely made up of a single value and then replace the corresponding column and row elements accordingly.\n2.  **Value Replacement:** Switch the elements along the row and column of the diagonal.\n\n**Applying the Transformation to the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify the \"diagonal\" elements:** Row 7 has 3.

The value to be placed on the column is 3.\n2.  **Row to Columns:** Keep the initial grid, and then append new columns where all values are 3.\n\n**Predicted Output Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n]\n```\nRefined Grid Text: Okay, I see the problem. My refined transformation pattern is still not correct. The transformation is more complex than just adding columns with the repeated value. It appears there is a rearrangement and duplication of values going on.\n\nLet's look at the training examples again and try to understand the logic behind the transformation.\n\n**Re-analyzing Training Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The '2's in the row are being translated into a diagonal pattern. Essentially the column containing '2' has become a diagonal with '1' in one case and zero otherwise.\n*   **Example 2:** The '8's in the row become a block-diagonal pattern.\n*   **Example 3:** The '4's in the row become a block-diagonal pattern.\n\n**Revised Transformation Pattern Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Row and Value:**  Find the row with repeated values and identify that repeated value. Let's call that value 'X'.\n2.  **Locate the Position of 'X':** Find the column index 'C' of 'X' in the original input grid.\n3.  **Create an Output Grid:**  The output grid has dimensions related to the number of times 'X' appears in its original row. It transforms column 'C' to a kind of block-diagonal of a new grid where 'X' populates it. The dimensions of the new grid corresponds to how many times 'X' occurred in the original row.\n\nThis is still hard to articulate concisely. Let me focus on how to get the output grid from the input.\n\n**Let's look at example 1 to solidify the Logic**\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nRow 6 is the repeated row with value 2.  Column 6 in the input matrix is the critical column containing the repeated value.\nThe target grid is 10x10, not 11x11 related to the size of the repeating row.\n\nFrom examples 2 and 3, one may surmise that other columns that also contain value `X` from the row containing repeated `X` values are also part of the output generation.\n\nI need to rethink the pattern entirely.\n\n**Back to Basics - Visual Pattern Matching**\n\nOkay, clearly I'm struggling to reverse engineer the logic. Let's try a purely visual pattern-matching approach. I'll focus on how the *shapes* of the numbers change.\n\n*   **Example 1 (2):** The column of 2's becomes a kind of \"X\" shape, but with a gap in the middle.\n*   **Example 2 (8):** The column of 8's splits and spreads out horizontally from center.\n*   **Example 3 (4):** The column of 4's spreads and makes a square.\n\n**Trying this visual analogy on the test input:**\n\nThe key row is row 6, the key number is 3. The column containing repeated 3 values is column 7. Let's look at other columns which also contain value 3 - there are none. So column 7 in the input is the 'active' column. The visual transformation applied to the 3's in column 7 seems to be to become \"horizontal bars above and below the center\".\n\nPredicted Grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nThis is also not close, the dimension has changed from 13x13 to 13x13, which is impossible.\nI am going to give up.\n```text\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_START\nOkay, I see the problem.

It appears elements in rows [0-11] and rows [17-28] are directly copied, and rows [12-16] are zeroed out.\n3. **The algorithm is making incorrect assumptions about row and column positions** The algorithm seems to be copying values, and filling in rows with zeros, instead of using zeros as row delimiters.\n\n**Refinement Strategy:**\n\nBecause rows [12-16] need to have elements copied in the right positions, the grid is refined to copy row values to the right locations.\n\n**Refined Grid:**\n\n```json\n[\n  [8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1],\n  [1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8],\n  [5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8],\n  [5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1],\n  [1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5],\n  [8, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2],\n  [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1],\n  [1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2],\n  [2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5],\n  [8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1],\n  [1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8],\n  [5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8],\n  [5, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1],\n  [1, 5, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8],\n  [5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8],\n  [5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1],\n  [1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5],\n  [2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5],\n  [8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1],\n  [1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8],\n  [5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8],\n  [5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1],\n  [1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5],\n  [8, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2],\n  [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1],\n  [1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2],\n  [2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5, 1, 5, 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8, 1, 8, 9, 1, 2, 5],\n  [8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 8, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1],\n  [1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 9, 1, 8, 2, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8]\n]\n```",

The 2x2 input is transformed into a 4x4 output where the input elements are placed along the diagonal, with zeros elsewhere.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[2, 8], [8, 2]]`\n    *   Output: `[[2, 2, 8, 8], [2, 2, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 2], [8, 8, 2, 2]]`\n    *   Transformation: Element Expansion. Each element in the 2x2 input is expanded into a 2x2 block in the 4x4 output.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input: A 29x29 grid.\n    *   Output: A 29x29 grid with some changes. The first 12 rows are identical. The next rows have some 0's introduced. The bottom few rows are the same as the top ones, but also include 0's in the middle.\n    *   Transformation: Value Replacement. The values are replaced based on their location.\n\n**Test Input Transformation:**\n\nBased on the training examples, Example 3 is the best fit. We must replace values with 0 based on their location. The zeroes seem to be placed near the middle of the grid. Specifically rows 13-17 and columns 3-4 and 14.16 are turned into 0's.

      "answer": "The training examples suggest that the output grid represents the arrangement of a specific number (the highest non-zero number in the input grid, or a distinguished number like '1' when multiple numbers exist) within the larger input grid. The output grid is much smaller than the input grid, likely 3x3. The arrangement in the output grid reflects the *relative* position of the specified number within the input grid.\n\nIn the provided input grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nThe highest non-zero number is 5. Then we look at the occurrences of 3. The given output:\n```\n[\n  [3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 3, 0],\n  [3, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nDoesn't seem to directly correspond to the arrangement of *either* 5 or 3. Let's consider a sliding window of size 3x3 in the input grid and determine the max number in each such window. Because we need to focus on the number 3, we may have to prioritize arrangement of 3s. Example 1 focuses on the arrangement of 1s, Example 2 on the arrangement of 4s, and Example 3 on the arrangement of 2s.\n\nLet's examine the positions of 3s. They appear in the following \"regions\": top-right, middle-left, middle-right, bottom-middle.\nThe existing output has 3s in the top-left and bottom-left. Let's try to rationalize the 3x3 grid.\nIf we consider a 3x3 grid starting at the top-left corner, the maximum number is 3.\nIf we consider a 3x3 grid starting at the top-right corner, the maximum number is 5.\n\nGiven the examples, we need to focus on where *the* non-zero number(s) appear. Let's transform all 5s to 3s (since 3 is the most common number):\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nNow the first 3x3 block has a 3. The top-middle 3x3 block has a 3. The top-right 3x3 block has 3s.\n\nLet's analyze the positions of 3s and update accordingly, focusing on \"pockets\" of 3's using a 3x3 window that slides across the input.

      "output": "Extracted Analogy: The transformation involves extracting key elements from the input grid to form a smaller output grid. Let's analyze the provided examples to deduce the pattern.\n\n**Example Analysis**\n\n*   **Example 1:** Non-zero elements are clustered in the top right, middle middle, and bottom left of the 10x10 input. The 3x3 output grid captures these key locations. The values in the 3x3 output grid seem to correspond to overlapping regions in the input.\n\n*   **Example 2:** Non-zero elements are clustered in similar locations as example 1 in the input grid. The values in the 3x3 output grid also seem to correspond to overlapping regions in the input.\n\n*   **Example 3:** Non-zero elements are clustered in the top right, middle middle, and bottom left of the 10x10 input. The 3x3 output grid captures these key locations. The values in the 3x3 output grid also seem to correspond to overlapping regions in the input.\n\n**Pattern Identification**\n\nThe general pattern is to extract a 3x3 grid from a larger 10x10 grid based on the distribution of non-zero elements. Let us attempt to pinpoint the indices involved.\n\nIn all examples, it appears that the output grid takes information from areas of the input grid centered (approximately) at the following locations (row, column) if we think of it in 0-based indexing:\n\n*   output[0][0] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[1:4][5:8]\n*   output[0][1] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[1:4][2:5]\n*   output[0][2] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[1:4][7:10]\n*   output[1][0] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[4:7][5:8]\n*   output[1][1] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[4:7][2:5]\n*   output[1][2] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[4:7][7:10]\n*   output[2][0] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[7:10][5:8]\n*   output[2][1] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[7:10][2:5]\n*   output[2][2] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[7:10][7:10]\n\nSince the output grid values correspond with the overlapping regions in the input grid, we'll have to find a function which determines the values based on the overlap.\n\n**Transformation on the Test Input**\n\nGiven the test input, we will extract the 3x3 grid.\nInput Grid:\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n*   output[0][0] : From Input[1:4][5:8]. The values are mostly 3, with a 5. The region is more centered around (2, 6) and (3, 7).\n*   output[0][1] : From Input[1:4][2:5]. All zeros.\n*   output[0][2] : From Input[1:4][7:10]. Values are mostly 0, with 3 in the corner.\n*   output[1][0] : From Input[4:7][5:8]. Values are mostly 0, with 3 in the corner.\n*   output[1][1] : From Input[4:7][2:5]. Values are all 3.\n*   output[1][2] : From Input[4:7][7:10]. Values are all 0.\n*   output[2][0] : From Input[7:10][5:8]. Values are all 3.\n*   output[2][1] : From Input[7:10][2:5]. Values are 0.\n*   output[2][2] : From Input[7:10][7:10]. Values are mostly 0, with 3 at (7, 7) and (8, 7).\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely transformation is a value replacement based on regions, and the output should be:\n```\n[\n  [3, 0, 0]\n  [0, 3, 0]\n  [3, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    input_grid = [\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    output_grid = [\n      [3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 3, 0],\n      [3, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    return output_grid\n```\n\n\nTransformed Grid Text: ```python\ndef solve():\n    input_grid = [\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    output_grid = [\n      [3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 3, 0],\n      [3, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    return output_grid\n```\nRefined Grid Text: The training examples suggest that the output grid represents the arrangement of a specific number (the highest non-zero number in the input grid, or a distinguished number like '1' when multiple numbers exist) within the larger input grid. The output grid is much smaller than the input grid, likely 3x3. The arrangement in the output grid reflects the *relative* position of the specified number within the input grid.\n\nIn the provided input grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nThe highest non-zero number is 5.

        "system_answer": "Okay, I see the problem. My refined transformation pattern is still not correct. The transformation is more complex than just adding columns with the repeated value. It appears there is a rearrangement and duplication of values going on.\n\nLet's look at the training examples again and try to understand the logic behind the transformation.\n\n**Re-analyzing Training Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The '2's in the row are being translated into a diagonal pattern. Essentially the column containing '2' has become a diagonal with '1' in one case and zero otherwise.\n*   **Example 2:** The '8's in the row become a block-diagonal pattern.\n*   **Example 3:** The '4's in the row become a block-diagonal pattern.\n\n**Revised Transformation Pattern Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Row and Value:**  Find the row with repeated values and identify that repeated value. Let's call that value 'X'.\n2.  **Locate the Position of 'X':** Find the column index 'C' of 'X' in the original input grid.\n3.  **Create an Output Grid:**  The output grid has dimensions related to the number of times 'X' appears in its original row. It transforms column 'C' to a kind of block-diagonal of a new grid where 'X' populates it. The dimensions of the new grid corresponds to how many times 'X' occurred in the original row.\n\nThis is still hard to articulate concisely.

The column containing repeated 3 values is column 7. Let's look at other columns which also contain value 3 - there are none. So column 7 in the input is the 'active' column.

The other '2' values become a zero. All the values in the original grid at index\\[x,5] and \\[5,x] are transformed.\n\n*   **Example 2:** The '8's along the diagonal in the Input Grid are replaced by zeros in the Output Grid. The '3' elements are replaced with '8's and vice versa along the edge and the diagonal\n\n*   **Example 3:** The '4's along the diagonal in the Input Grid are replaced by zeros in the Output Grid. The '2' elements are replaced with '4's and vice versa along the edge and the diagonal.\n\nBased on these observations, the transformation pattern appears to be:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"diagonal\" elements:** Find the row in the Input Grid that is almost entirely made up of a single value and then replace the corresponding column and row elements accordingly.\n2.  **Value Replacement:** Switch the elements along the row and column of the diagonal.\n\n**Applying the Transformation to the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify the \"diagonal\" elements:** Row 7 has 3.

My refined transformation pattern is still not correct. The transformation is more complex than just adding columns with the repeated value. It appears there is a rearrangement and duplication of values going on.\n\nLet's look at the training examples again and try to understand the logic behind the transformation.\n\n**Re-analyzing Training Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The '2's in the row are being translated into a diagonal pattern. Essentially the column containing '2' has become a diagonal with '1' in one case and zero otherwise.\n*   **Example 2:** The '8's in the row become a block-diagonal pattern.\n*   **Example 3:** The '4's in the row become a block-diagonal pattern.\n\n**Revised Transformation Pattern Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Row and Value:**  Find the row with repeated values and identify that repeated value. Let's call that value 'X'.\n2.  **Locate the Position of 'X':** Find the column index 'C' of 'X' in the original input grid.\n3.  **Create an Output Grid:**  The output grid has dimensions related to the number of times 'X' appears in its original row. It transforms column 'C' to a kind of block-diagonal of a new grid where 'X' populates it. The dimensions of the new grid corresponds to how many times 'X' occurred in the original row.\n\nThis is still hard to articulate concisely.

It appears there is a rearrangement and duplication of values going on.\n\nLet's look at the training examples again and try to understand the logic behind the transformation.\n\n**Re-analyzing Training Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** The '2's in the row are being translated into a diagonal pattern. Essentially the column containing '2' has become a diagonal with '1' in one case and zero otherwise.\n*   **Example 2:** The '8's in the row become a block-diagonal pattern.\n*   **Example 3:** The '4's in the row become a block-diagonal pattern.\n\n**Revised Transformation Pattern Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Row and Value:**  Find the row with repeated values and identify that repeated value. Let's call that value 'X'.\n2.  **Locate the Position of 'X':** Find the column index 'C' of 'X' in the original input grid.\n3.  **Create an Output Grid:**  The output grid has dimensions related to the number of times 'X' appears in its original row. It transforms column 'C' to a kind of block-diagonal of a new grid where 'X' populates it. The dimensions of the new grid corresponds to how many times 'X' occurred in the original row.\n\nThis is still hard to articulate concisely. Let me focus on how to get the output grid from the input.\n\n**Let's look at example 1 to solidify the Logic**\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]\n  [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]\n  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nRow 6 is the repeated row with value 2.  Column 6 in the input matrix is the critical column containing the repeated value.\nThe target grid is 10x10, not 11x11 related to the size of the repeating row.\n\nFrom examples 2 and 3, one may surmise that other columns that also contain value `X` from the row containing repeated `X` values are also part of the output generation.\n\nI need to rethink the pattern entirely.\n\n**Back to Basics - Visual Pattern Matching**\n\nOkay, clearly I'm struggling to reverse engineer the logic. Let's try a purely visual pattern-matching approach. I'll focus on how the *shapes* of the numbers change.\n\n*   **Example 1 (2):** The column of 2's becomes a kind of \"X\" shape, but with a gap in the middle.\n*   **Example 2 (8):** The column of 8's splits and spreads out horizontally from center.\n*   **Example 3 (4):** The column of 4's spreads and makes a square.\n\n**Trying this visual analogy on the test input:**\n\nThe key row is row 6, the key number is 3. The column containing repeated 3 values is column 7. Let's look at other columns which also contain value 3 - there are none. So column 7 in the input is the 'active' column. The visual transformation applied to the 3's in column 7 seems to be to become \"horizontal bars above and below the center\".\n\nPredicted Grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nThis is also not close, the dimension has changed from 13x13 to 13x13, which is impossible.\nI am going to give up.\n```text\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

The 2x2 input is transformed into a 4x4 output where the input elements are placed along the diagonal, with zeros elsewhere.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n\n    *   Input: `[[2, 8], [8, 2]]`\n    *   Output: `[[2, 2, 8, 8], [2, 2, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 2], [8, 8, 2, 2]]`\n    *   Transformation: Element Expansion. Each element in the 2x2 input is expanded into a 2x2 block in the 4x4 output.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n\n    *   Input: A 29x29 grid.\n    *   Output: A 29x29 grid with some changes. The first 12 rows are identical. The next rows have some 0's introduced. The bottom few rows are the same as the top ones, but also include 0's in the middle.\n    *   Transformation: Value Replacement. The values are replaced based on their location.\n\n**Test Input Transformation:**\n\nBased on the training examples, Example 3 is the best fit. We must replace values with 0 based on their location. The zeroes seem to be placed near the middle of the grid. Specifically rows 13-17 and columns 3-4 and 14.16 are turned into 0's.

analyzed the problem and the generated grid. Here's my assessment and the refined grid:\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe transformation seems to involve the following:\n\n1.  **Expansion:** The initial 9x29 grid is expanded to a 29x29 grid.\n2.  **Placement of Original Elements:** The original numbers from the input grid appear in the expanded grid.

        "system_answer": "The training examples suggest that the output grid represents the arrangement of a specific number (the highest non-zero number in the input grid, or a distinguished number like '1' when multiple numbers exist) within the larger input grid. The output grid is much smaller than the input grid, likely 3x3. The arrangement in the output grid reflects the *relative* position of the specified number within the input grid.\n\nIn the provided input grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nThe highest non-zero number is 5. Then we look at the occurrences of 3. The given output:\n```\n[\n  [3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 3, 0],\n  [3, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nDoesn't seem to directly correspond to the arrangement of *either* 5 or 3. Let's consider a sliding window of size 3x3 in the input grid and determine the max number in each such window. Because we need to focus on the number 3, we may have to prioritize arrangement of 3s. Example 1 focuses on the arrangement of 1s, Example 2 on the arrangement of 4s, and Example 3 on the arrangement of 2s.\n\nLet's examine the positions of 3s. They appear in the following \"regions\": top-right, middle-left, middle-right, bottom-middle.\nThe existing output has 3s in the top-left and bottom-left. Let's try to rationalize the 3x3 grid.\nIf we consider a 3x3 grid starting at the top-left corner, the maximum number is 3.\nIf we consider a 3x3 grid starting at the top-right corner, the maximum number is 5.\n\nGiven the examples, we need to focus on where *the* non-zero number(s) appear. Let's transform all 5s to 3s (since 3 is the most common number):\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nNow the first 3x3 block has a 3. The top-middle 3x3 block has a 3. The top-right 3x3 block has 3s.\n\nLet's analyze the positions of 3s and update accordingly, focusing on \"pockets\" of 3's using a 3x3 window that slides across the input. Let's update the output:\n```\n[\n  [3, 3, 3],\n  [3, 0, 3],\n  [3, 3, 0]\n]\n```\nThis reflects 3s appearing in many positions.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    input_grid = [\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    output_grid = [\n      [3, 3, 3],\n      [3, 0, 3],\n      [3, 3, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    return output_grid\n```",

Let us attempt to pinpoint the indices involved.\n\nIn all examples, it appears that the output grid takes information from areas of the input grid centered (approximately) at the following locations (row, column) if we think of it in 0-based indexing:\n\n*   output[0][0] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[1:4][5:8]\n*   output[0][1] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[1:4][2:5]\n*   output[0][2] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[1:4][7:10]\n*   output[1][0] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[4:7][5:8]\n*   output[1][1] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[4:7][2:5]\n*   output[1][2] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[4:7][7:10]\n*   output[2][0] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[7:10][5:8]\n*   output[2][1] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[7:10][2:5]\n*   output[2][2] : Input grid area centered at approximately Input[7:10][7:10]\n\nSince the output grid values correspond with the overlapping regions in the input grid, we'll have to find a function which determines the values based on the overlap.\n\n**Transformation on the Test Input**\n\nGiven the test input, we will extract the 3x3 grid.\nInput Grid:\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n*   output[0][0] : From Input[1:4][5:8]. The values are mostly 3, with a 5. The region is more centered around (2, 6) and (3, 7).\n*   output[0][1] : From Input[1:4][2:5]. All zeros.\n*   output[0][2] : From Input[1:4][7:10]. Values are mostly 0, with 3 in the corner.\n*   output[1][0] : From Input[4:7][5:8]. Values are mostly 0, with 3 in the corner.\n*   output[1][1] : From Input[4:7][2:5]. Values are all 3.\n*   output[1][2] : From Input[4:7][7:10]. Values are all 0.\n*   output[2][0] : From Input[7:10][5:8]. Values are all 3.\n*   output[2][1] : From Input[7:10][2:5]. Values are 0.\n*   output[2][2] : From Input[7:10][7:10]. Values are mostly 0, with 3 at (7, 7) and (8, 7).\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely transformation is a value replacement based on regions, and the output should be:\n```\n[\n  [3, 0, 0]\n  [0, 3, 0]\n  [3, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    input_grid = [\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    output_grid = [\n      [3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 3, 0],\n      [3, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    return output_grid\n```\n\n\nTransformed Grid Text: ```python\ndef solve():\n    input_grid = [\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    output_grid = [\n      [3, 0, 0],\n      [0, 3, 0],\n      [3, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    return output_grid\n```\nRefined Grid Text: The training examples suggest that the output grid represents the arrangement of a specific number (the highest non-zero number in the input grid, or a distinguished number like '1' when multiple numbers exist) within the larger input grid. The output grid is much smaller than the input grid, likely 3x3. The arrangement in the output grid reflects the *relative* position of the specified number within the input grid.\n\nIn the provided input grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nThe highest non-zero number is 5. Then we look at the occurrences of 3. The given output:\n```\n[\n  [3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 3, 0],\n  [3, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nDoesn't seem to directly correspond to the arrangement of *either* 5 or 3. Let's consider a sliding window of size 3x3 in the input grid and determine the max number in each such window. Because we need to focus on the number 3, we may have to prioritize arrangement of 3s. Example 1 focuses on the arrangement of 1s, Example 2 on the arrangement of 4s, and Example 3 on the arrangement of 2s.\n\nLet's examine the positions of 3s. They appear in the following \"regions\": top-right, middle-left, middle-right, bottom-middle.\nThe existing output has 3s in the top-left and bottom-left. Let's try to rationalize the 3x3 grid.\nIf we consider a 3x3 grid starting at the top-left corner, the maximum number is 3.\nIf we consider a 3x3 grid starting at the top-right corner, the maximum number is 5.\n\nGiven the examples, we need to focus on where *the* non-zero number(s) appear. Let's transform all 5s to 3s (since 3 is the most common number):\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nNow the first 3x3 block has a 3. The top-middle 3x3 block has a 3.

This leads to the system applying incorrect rules or strategies.\n*   **Visual/Spatial Reasoning:** Another critical bottleneck is in performing appropriate visual and spatial reasoning. The system lacks the ability to \"see\" the patterns correctly, even with step-by-step analysis.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of Transformation Logic:** A recurring pattern is the misinterpretation of how the input grid is transformed to produce the output grid. The system frequently latches onto surface-level observations or simple value replacement strategies, instead of capturing the more complex underlying pattern.\n*   **Inability to Handle Different Scales:** The error cases show a challenge in understanding how the dimensions of the input relate to the dimensions of the output. In some cases, the system assumes an impossible transformation, such as one where the dimensions of both input and output are the same.\n*   **Focusing on Numerical Value Rather Than Spatial Relationship:** In several cases, the system fixates on specific numerical values, attempting to swap or replace them, rather than recognizing the broader spatial relationships and structural changes that are occurring.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem to fix is improving the system's ability to **correctly abstract and generalize the transformation pattern** from the training examples.

      "text_report": "Here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided information.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Pattern Identification and Generalization:** In Sample ID 0, the system makes multiple attempts to identify a pattern, refining its hypothesis several times. It initially tries to find diagonal elements and perform value replacements. It then shifts to identifying a key row and using those values to create new columns. Later, it tries visual pattern matching based on \"shapes\" of numbers. All attempts fail, leading to an all-zero grid.\n\n2.  **Impossible Transformations:** Sample ID 0 tries transformations where the dimensions of both input and output are the same.\n\n3.  **Giving Up:** When the system fails to identify a pattern, it gives up and defaults to an all-zero grid. This is undesirable; the system should ideally provide a \"best guess\" rather than a completely empty output.\n\n4.  **Incorrect Dimension Assumptions:** In Sample ID 2, the initial analysis assumes the 29x29 grid is \"expanded\" from the 9x29 grid, which is incorrect. The dimensions are already the same.\n\n5.  **Unrealistic Transformations:** Both samples use a \"Value Replacement\" method, but the code generated is not accurate. This suggests the system is using the wrong transformation and doesn't know how to apply the correct one.\n\n6.  **Inability to Handle Nuance:** The system can't \"understand\" how the dimensions of the input relate to the dimensions of the output.\n\n7.  **Misinterpretation of Instructions:** After re-analyzing the training examples in Sample ID 0, the system still makes incorrect assumptions about column positions, meaning the algorithm is making incorrect assumptions about row and column positions and uses zeros as row delimiters.\n\n8.  **Lack of Visual/Spatial Reasoning:** The system struggles to abstract essential elements of the transformation and generalize it to new inputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates very limited capability in solving the Abstract Reasoning tasks. Its accuracy is effectively zero.

This leads to the system applying incorrect rules or strategies.\n*   **Visual/Spatial Reasoning:** Another critical bottleneck is in performing appropriate visual and spatial reasoning. The system lacks the ability to \"see\" the patterns correctly, even with step-by-step analysis.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of Transformation Logic:** A recurring pattern is the misinterpretation of how the input grid is transformed to produce the output grid. The system frequently latches onto surface-level observations or simple value replacement strategies, instead of capturing the more complex underlying pattern.\n*   **Inability to Handle Different Scales:** The error cases show a challenge in understanding how the dimensions of the input relate to the dimensions of the output. In some cases, the system assumes an impossible transformation, such as one where the dimensions of both input and output are the same.\n*   **Focusing on Numerical Value Rather Than Spatial Relationship:** In several cases, the system fixates on specific numerical values, attempting to swap or replace them, rather than recognizing the broader spatial relationships and structural changes that are occurring.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem to fix is improving the system's ability to **correctly abstract and generalize the transformation pattern** from the training examples. This requires a more sophisticated approach to pattern recognition that goes beyond surface-level observations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system needs significant improvement in its pattern recognition capabilities, particularly in identifying and abstracting the underlying rules that govern the grid transformations.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to reason about spatial relationships and arrangements within the grid. This could involve incorporating techniques from computer vision or image processing to better understand the structural changes that are occurring.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Improve the system's ability to identify and apply dimension constraints to avoid generating impossible solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Incorporate a Rule Induction Module:** Implement a rule induction module that attempts to explicitly learn the transformation rules from the training examples. This module should be able to handle different types of transformations, such as value replacement, spatial rearrangement, and dimension changes.\n*   **Use Computer Vision Techniques:** Incorporate computer vision techniques, such as edge detection, shape recognition, and feature extraction, to help the system better understand the spatial relationships and structures within the grid.\n*   **Develop a Constraint Checker:** Develop a constraint checker that can verify the validity of generated solutions against dimension and other constraints. This checker should be able to identify impossible transformations and prevent the system from pursuing them.\n*   **Implement Confidence Scoring:** Implement a confidence scoring mechanism to evaluate the reliability of the generated solution based on its consistency with the training examples. Only output grids if the confidence score passes a threshold value.\n*    **Print Intermediate Outputs:** Insert `print` statements after each pattern detection step in order to verify the reasoning process. This will provide better insight for later analysis and fixing.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided information.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n1.  **Incorrect Pattern Identification and Generalization:** In Sample ID 0, the system makes multiple attempts to identify a pattern, refining its hypothesis several times. It initially tries to find diagonal elements and perform value replacements. It then shifts to identifying a key row and using those values to create new columns. Later, it tries visual pattern matching based on \"shapes\" of numbers. All attempts fail, leading to an all-zero grid.\n\n2.  **Impossible Transformations:** Sample ID 0 tries transformations where the dimensions of both input and output are the same.\n\n3.  **Giving Up:** When the system fails to identify a pattern, it gives up and defaults to an all-zero grid. This is undesirable; the system should ideally provide a \"best guess\" rather than a completely empty output.\n\n4.  **Incorrect Dimension Assumptions:** In Sample ID 2, the initial analysis assumes the 29x29 grid is \"expanded\" from the 9x29 grid, which is incorrect. The dimensions are already the same.\n\n5.  **Unrealistic Transformations:** Both samples use a \"Value Replacement\" method, but the code generated is not accurate. This suggests the system is using the wrong transformation and doesn't know how to apply the correct one.\n\n6.  **Inability to Handle Nuance:** The system can't \"understand\" how the dimensions of the input relate to the dimensions of the output.\n\n7.  **Misinterpretation of Instructions:** After re-analyzing the training examples in Sample ID 0, the system still makes incorrect assumptions about column positions, meaning the algorithm is making incorrect assumptions about row and column positions and uses zeros as row delimiters.\n\n8.  **Lack of Visual/Spatial Reasoning:** The system struggles to abstract essential elements of the transformation and generalize it to new inputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates very limited capability in solving the Abstract Reasoning tasks. Its accuracy is effectively zero. While it can identify some basic features and attempt iterative refinement, its core pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, and generalization abilities are severely lacking. The system often defaults to incorrect assumptions and gives up easily, resulting in useless outputs.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Attempted):** The system *attempts* to identify and analyze patterns in the training examples, even though it often fails.

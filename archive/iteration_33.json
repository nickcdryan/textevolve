  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLMs to solve grid transformation problems by employing a template matching and refinement approach. The problem is decomposed into matching the input grid to a similar training example and then refining the transformation based on the matched example's context. Two agent roles are defined: one for matching grids and another for refining transformations. The function `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process, calling `match_template` to find a relevant training example and `refine_transformation` to generate the final solution. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini LLM, and the `main` function is used to initiate and manage the entire process.",

The observed transformations are complex and likely involve a combination of mirroring, replicating, and value substitution based on proximity to specific cells. The system struggles with this complexity.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** The system does not consistently apply the transformation rules implied by the training examples, resulting in incorrect values and grid dimensions.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Abstract Pattern Recognition & Generalization:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to derive the underlying transformation rules from the examples and apply them to unseen inputs accurately. The complexity of these transformations, which are likely a combination of several sub-rules (mirroring, expanding, value substitution) is too high.\n2.  **Precise Application of Transformation Rules:** Even if the system could identify the pattern, applying it with the correct positioning and value assignment seems to be a challenge.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1. **Incorrect values**: The system frequently places the values in incorrect locations. This indicates a failure to accurately follow or learn the patterns presented in the training examples.\n2. **Incorrect dimensions**: The system incorrectly determines the size (number of rows and columns) of the output grid based on the input grid and training examples.\n3. **Lack of clear transformation strategy**: It appears that the system does not have a solid, generalizable strategy to transform the test inputs based on the training examples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's flawed pattern recognition and generalization capabilities.

Train separate modules or layers to handle each sub-rule.\n2. **Enhance the pattern matching:** Employing techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn spatial relationships within the grids or sequence-to-sequence models to directly map input grids to output grids.\n3.  **Introduce Explicit Representation of Rules:** Instead of implicitly learning rules, attempt to explicitly extract the transformation rules from the training examples and represent them in a structured format.

The actual problem this sample is related to, involves expanding the input grid.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system outputs a grid (6x6). The input grid is (3x2). The expected grid should have values replaced based on the sum of their indices. The model seems to have attempted number transformation but failed to generate a complete grid, again highlighting issues with pattern generalization and constraint handling (the grid size is wrong, and the values are not related to the sum of the indices).\n*   **Sample 2:** The system outputs a (10x10) grid, the input grid is (3x3). The expected grid should involve value replacement, where a cell's value is based on the number of neighbors that also have that value. The model fails to correctly infer the relationship, and the output dimensions are also wrong. The output grid also does not follow any discernible pattern from the input grid, indicating a failure to generalize from the training examples.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of the task's goal (generating output grids) but is fundamentally flawed in its ability to recognize, generalize, and apply transformation patterns. While it can parse the input grids, its pattern recognition and constraint handling are severely deficient, leading to inaccurate results.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Grid Recognition:** Correctly parses input grid structures.\n*   **Output Generation:** Able to generate structured output grids (though incorrect).\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Generalization:** Fails to identify complex transformation rules.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Cannot consistently apply identified rules correctly (grid size, value placement).\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Generalization:** Improve the system's ability to infer transformation rules from training examples and apply them to new inputs.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement a Pattern Decomposition Module:**\n    *   Break down complex transformations into simpler sub-rules (e.g., mirroring, rotation, value replacement).\n    *   Develop specialized modules or layers for each sub-rule.\n    *   Train these modules independently before integrating them.\n2.  **Enhance Spatial Reasoning:**\n    *   Incorporate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn spatial relationships within the grids.\n    *   Consider sequence-to-sequence models to directly map input grids to output grids.\n3.  **Implement Explicit Rule Representation and Extraction:**\n    *   Develop a module that attempts to explicitly extract transformation rules from the training examples.\n    *   Represent rules in a structured format (e.g., \"If cell(x,y) == 1, then cell(x+1, y+1) = 2\").\n4.  **Introduce Step-by-step Transformation Verification**:\n    *   Incorporate verification mechanisms during intermediate steps. This could mean outputting a partial transformation before proceeding to the next transformation step.\n5.  **Sub-rule Evaluation and Targeted Training:**\n    *   Evaluate the model's performance on each sub-rule independently.\n    *   Focus training data and strategies on improving the model's performance on specific, weaker sub-rules. For example, increase the number of examples where the model needs to determine the final grid size.\n\n**CAPABILITY MAPPING (Revised to reflect sub-rule decomposition and testing):**\n\n**Sample ID 0:** (Expansion - the underlying rule)\n*   information_extraction: Successful.\n*   grid_dimension_determination: Failed.\n*   value_replacement: Failed.\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n\n**Sample ID 1:** (Index-based Value Transformation)\n*   information_extraction: Successful.\n*   grid_dimension_determination: Failed.\n*   index_summation: Failed.\n*   value_mapping: Failed.\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n\n**Sample ID 2:** (Neighbor-based Value Transformation)\n*   information_extraction: Successful.\n*   grid_dimension_determination: Failed.\n*   neighbor_counting: Failed.\n*   value_mapping: Failed.\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the system's capabilities are stable at a very low level (near-zero accuracy).

The expected grid should involve value replacement, where a cell's value is based on the number of neighbors that also have that value. The model fails to correctly infer the relationship, and the output dimensions are also wrong. The output grid also does not follow any discernible pattern from the input grid, indicating a failure to generalize from the training examples.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of the task's goal (generating output grids) but is fundamentally flawed in its ability to recognize, generalize, and apply transformation patterns. While it can parse the input grids, its pattern recognition and constraint handling are severely deficient, leading to inaccurate results.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Grid Recognition:** Correctly parses input grid structures.\n*   **Output Generation:** Able to generate structured output grids (though incorrect).\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Generalization:** Fails to identify complex transformation rules.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Cannot consistently apply identified rules correctly (grid size, value placement).\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Generalization:** Improve the system's ability to infer transformation rules from training examples and apply them to new inputs.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement a Pattern Decomposition Module:**\n    *   Break down complex transformations into simpler sub-rules (e.g., mirroring, rotation, value replacement).\n    *   Develop specialized modules or layers for each sub-rule.\n    *   Train these modules independently before integrating them.\n2.  **Enhance Spatial Reasoning:**\n    *   Incorporate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn spatial relationships within the grids.\n    *   Consider sequence-to-sequence models to directly map input grids to output grids.\n3.  **Implement Explicit Rule Representation and Extraction:**\n    *   Develop a module that attempts to explicitly extract transformation rules from the training examples.\n    *   Represent rules in a structured format (e.g., \"If cell(x,y) == 1, then cell(x+1, y+1) = 2\").\n4.  **Introduce Step-by-step Transformation Verification**:\n    *   Incorporate verification mechanisms during intermediate steps. This could mean outputting a partial transformation before proceeding to the next transformation step.\n5.  **Sub-rule Evaluation and Targeted Training:**\n    *   Evaluate the model's performance on each sub-rule independently.\n    *   Focus training data and strategies on improving the model's performance on specific, weaker sub-rules. For example, increase the number of examples where the model needs to determine the final grid size.\n\n**CAPABILITY MAPPING (Revised to reflect sub-rule decomposition and testing):**\n\n**Sample ID 0:** (Expansion - the underlying rule)\n*   information_extraction: Successful.\n*   grid_dimension_determination: Failed.\n*   value_replacement: Failed.\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n\n**Sample ID 1:** (Index-based Value Transformation)\n*   information_extraction: Successful.\n*   grid_dimension_determination: Failed.\n*   index_summation: Failed.\n*   value_mapping: Failed.\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n\n**Sample ID 2:** (Neighbor-based Value Transformation)\n*   information_extraction: Successful.\n*   grid_dimension_determination: Failed.\n*   neighbor_counting: Failed.\n*   value_mapping: Failed.\n*   constraint_handling: Failed.\n*   solution_generation: Failed.\n*   solution_verification: Failed.\n*   decision_making: Failed.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the system's capabilities are stable at a very low level (near-zero accuracy). Implementing the above recommendations should lead to a demonstrable improvement trend in the next iteration. Focus on measuring the accuracy of individual sub-rules after implementing pattern decomposition.\n"

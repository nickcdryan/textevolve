  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions by analyzing the question, extracting relevant information, generating an initial answer, and then verifying it. The problem is decomposed into four distinct steps handled by specialized LLM agents: `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer`. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini API. The `main` function orchestrates the entire process, calling each function in sequence and returning the final verified answer or an error message.",

This is particularly problematic when multiple similar events occur in the passage.\n2.  **Comparative Analysis:** The system struggles to do comparative analysis between different events in the passage, which is needed to identify the maximum/minimum value for a particular criteria.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe main error pattern is the inability to correctly identify the *longest* touchdown play when multiple touchdowns are described in the passage. The system picks out *a* touchdown play and extracts the player's name correctly, but doesn't seem to compare each touchdown play to correctly identify the longest.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to perform comparative analysis of events to determine the maximum or minimum value for a given property (e.g., the longest touchdown play). The system needs a mechanism to compare yardages to identify the play with the greatest value.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Comparative Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to compare multiple events based on specific criteria (e.g., distance, time, quantity).\n2.  **Constraint Application:** Improve the system's ability to identify and apply constraints such as \"longest\" or \"most frequent.\"\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Introduce a \"Comparison\" Step:** Explicitly add a step to the reasoning process that compares all relevant events (e.g., all touchdown plays) based on the specified criterion (e.g., yardage).

This might involve using keywords like \"longest,\" \"shortest,\" \"most,\" or \"least\" to guide the extraction process.\n3.  **Incorporate Yardage Comparison at Retrieval:** As information is being extracted about each TD pass, incorporate an ongoing comparison such that you are only ever returning the player associated with the max distance.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction (partially failed: extracted the wrong information due to lack of comparative analysis)\n    *   constraint_handling (failed: didn't correctly apply the \"longest\" constraint)\n    *   decision_making (failed: made the wrong decision due to incorrect information)\n",

The system is accurately identifying and extracting numerical percentages.\n*   **Output 2 (\"DeSean Jackson\"):** This corresponds to the error analysis case where the system identifies *a* long touchdown pass, but not necessarily the *longest.* This confirms the weakness in comparative analysis.

Specifically:\n    *   **Keyword Identification:**  When a question includes keywords like \"longest,\" \"shortest,\" \"most,\" or \"least,\" the extraction module should adjust its strategy to specifically focus on identifying and extracting properties relevant to that constraint.  For example, if the question is \"Who had the longest touchdown?\", the extraction module should prioritize extracting yardage information associated with each touchdown pass.\n    *   **Contextual Analysis:** Perform contextual analysis around keywords to understand the intended constraint.\n\n3.  **Test-Driven Development for Comparison Logic:**  Create a comprehensive test suite specifically designed to evaluate the system's comparative reasoning abilities.  This test suite should include a variety of questions that require the system to identify the maximum or minimum value for different properties and constraints.\n\n4.  **Refine Post-Processing Logic:** Implement a post-processing step that iterates through the extracted data and performs comparisons.

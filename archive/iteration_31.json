  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach, breaking down the problem into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. Each stage uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model with a specific system instruction that defines the agent's role (e.g., expert at analyzing questions). The overall workflow involves sequentially calling `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer`, passing the output of each as input to the next, to arrive at a final verified answer.",

A crowd of 2,000 Mappilas from the neighbourhood foiled the attempt, but on the following day a squad of police arrested a number of Khilafat volunteers and seized records at the Mambaram mosque in Tirurangadi, leading to rumours that the building had been desecrated. A large crowd of Mappilas converged on Tirurangadi and besieged the local police station. The police opened fire on the crowd, triggering a furious reaction which soon engulfed the Eranad and Valluvanad taluks along with neighbouring areas and continued for over two months. Following the mosque incident, the rebels attacked and seized police stations, government treasuries, and entered the courts and registry offices where they destroyed records. Some even climbed into the judges' seats and proclaimed the advent of swaraj .

Pittsburgh scored first in the first quarter when Ben Roethlisberger found Le'Veon Bell for a 20-yard pass to make it 7-0 and the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Steelers moved up 14-0 when Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown. The Ravens got on the board when Joe Flacco found Chris Moore on a 30-yard pass to make it 14-7. The Steelers then moved ahead by double digits again when Chris Boswell put up a 52-yard field goal to make it 17-7. The Ravens then came within 3 when Alex Collins ran for an 18-yard touchdown to make the score 17-14. The Steelers closed out the half with another field goal kicked by Boswell from 43 yards out to make it 20-14 at halftime. In the third quarter, it was all Ravens when they took the lead after scoring 3 times: First when Justin Tucker managed to nail a 47-yard field goal to make it 20-17. This would be followed by Javorious Allen's 1-yard touchdown run as they took the lead 24-20. Flacco then found Patrick Ricard on a 6-yard pass as the Ravens moved up by double digits 31-20. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers managed to come within 2, starting with a 24-yard field goal kicked by Boswell shortening the Ravens' lead to 31-23. This would then be followed up by Roethlisberger connecting with Roosevelt Nix on a 1-yard pass (with a failed 2-point conversion) to make it 31-29. The Ravens managed to pull away when Allen ran for a 9-yard touchdown to make it 38-29. The Steelers then completed the comeback when Bell ran for an 11-yard touchdown to make it 38-36. This would be followed by Boswell kicking a 46-yard field goal to make it 39-38. The Ravens then got the ball back, but Flacco was sacked by T. J. Watt as time expired, sealing the win for the Steelers. With the win, the Steelers improved to 11-2 and were awarded the AFC North division title. The team also managed to win their 9th straight game over a divisional opponent. Pittsburgh notched their first 3-game win streak over the Ravens since defeating them three times during the 2008 season (including the playoffs). The teams' 77 combined points marked the most in series history. The team also swept the Ravens for the first time since 2008.  With the division clinched, the team would win consecutive titles for the first time since the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The Steelers' second consecutive 11+ point comeback victory marked the first time the Steelers had accomplished this feat since coming back from down 14 against the Denver Broncos on December 7, 1997 and then again from down 14 against the New England Patriots on December 13, 1997.\n\nQUESTION: From what distance were two touchdowns runs scored from?",

A crowd of 2,000 Mappilas from the neighbourhood foiled the attempt, but on the following day a squad of police arrested a number of Khilafat volunteers and seized records at the Mambaram mosque in Tirurangadi, leading to rumours that the building had been desecrated. A large crowd of Mappilas converged on Tirurangadi and besieged the local police station. The police opened fire on the crowd, triggering a furious reaction which soon engulfed the Eranad and Valluvanad taluks along with neighbouring areas and continued for over two months. Following the mosque incident, the rebels attacked and seized police stations, government treasuries, and entered the courts and registry offices where they destroyed records. Some even climbed into the judges' seats and proclaimed the advent of swaraj . The rebellion soon spread to the neighbouring areas of Malappuram, Manjeri, Perinthalmanna, Pandikkad and Tirur under principle leaders Variankunnath Kunjahammad Haji, Seethi Koya Thangal of Kumaranpathor and Ali Musliyar. By 8 August 1921, British administration had virtually come to an end in Malappuram, Tirurangadi, Manjeri, and Perinthalmanna, which then fell into the hands of the rebels who established complete domination over the Eranad and Valluvanad Taluks. On 24 August 1921, Variankunnath Kunjahammad Haji took over command of the rebellion from Ali Musliyar. Public proclamations were issued by Variyankunnath and Seethi that no harm should come to Hindus and that those Mappilas who resorted to looting would receive exemplary punishments.",

This would be followed by Boswell kicking a 46-yard field goal to make it 39-38. The Ravens then got the ball back, but Flacco was sacked by T. J. Watt as time expired, sealing the win for the Steelers. With the win, the Steelers improved to 11-2 and were awarded the AFC North division title. The team also managed to win their 9th straight game over a divisional opponent. Pittsburgh notched their first 3-game win streak over the Ravens since defeating them three times during the 2008 season (including the playoffs). The teams' 77 combined points marked the most in series history. The team also swept the Ravens for the first time since 2008.  With the division clinched, the team would win consecutive titles for the first time since the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The Steelers' second consecutive 11+ point comeback victory marked the first time the Steelers had accomplished this feat since coming back from down 14 against the Denver Broncos on December 7, 1997 and then again from down 14 against the New England Patriots on December 13, 1997.",

This is seen in the successful cases where it calculates the difference between two numbers or identifies which team allowed the most points.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Answer Formatting and Completeness:** The system sometimes provides answers with unnecessary prefixes (\"Verification:\") or fails to extract the actual desired answer, only providing a verification status. This indicates a problem in the final answer generation step.\n2.  **Lack of Contextual Awareness:** While the system can extract relevant information, it sometimes struggles to connect the dots or synthesize the information into a concise answer, especially when the question requires a specific format.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Final Answer Generation:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to reliably format and output the desired answer in the correct format, even when it has correctly identified or calculated the answer internally. The added \"Verification:\" suggests that the program is trying to verify correctness, but fails to output what it has verified.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **\"Verification:\" Prefix:** In several successful cases, the system prepends \"Verification:\" to the answer, which isn't always required or ideal.

This suggests a final step error where the actual answer is not being extracted from the internal representation and displayed as the final output.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Answer Extraction and Formatting:** The system needs a more robust mechanism to extract and format the final answer in the exact required format. This might involve more precise instructions or post-processing to remove unnecessary prefixes/suffixes.\n2.  **Template Handling:** If using templates for generating answers, ensure the templates are correctly filled with the extracted information, and that templates are not being misidentified causing the verification response when the answer is required.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Refine Answer Extraction Logic:** Review the code responsible for extracting the final answer from the reasoning process.

For example, numerical answers should be presented without any prefixes, while entity-based answers should directly name the entity.\n4.  **Add Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to verify that the answer extraction and formatting logic produces the expected output for various question types and passage scenarios.

Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Sample 1 (\"Roscoe Parrish\"):** The system appears to correctly identify \"Roscoe Parrish\" as relevant but fails to provide it directly as the answer. Instead, it prefixes it with \"Verification:\". This indicates a potential problem in answer formatting or template usage.\n*   **Sample 2 (\"Passes Rodgers Missed\"):** This output is verbose and provides a complete explanation of the reasoning, which is good. However, it doesn't extract *just* the answer (6). It explains how the answer was derived. While not *wrong*, it demonstrates an inconsistency in how the system presents its answers.  It suggests the system *can* do calculations and reason, but doesn't know *when* to provide the raw answer vs. the full explanation.\n*   **Sample 3 (\"Vadakkevittil Muhammed\"):** This output is a mix of positive and negative. The system initially states that the answer is *incorrect*, but then provides an alternative, which is positive. This suggests a possible issue in the reasoning or fact verification stage. The system does eventually provide a suitable response, but there is a mis-step in the process.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n*   The \"Verification:\" prefix is a recurring issue and is often unnecessary and even, in some cases, *harmful* when it masks the desired answer.\n*   The system sometimes provides verbose, explanation-driven outputs, even when only the final answer is required.\n*   The reasoning appears mostly sound, but the initial assessment of correctness can be flawed, leading to a potentially misleading response.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates good *potential* for information extraction and basic reasoning. However, its reliability is hampered by issues in answer formatting, output control, and sometimes a flawed initial assessment of the correctness of the answer. The system seems to struggle with distinguishing when an explanation is needed versus when the direct answer should be returned.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** It identifies and extracts relevant information from the input text.\n*   **Reasoning:** It can perform calculations and logical comparisons to answer questions.\n*   **Potential for Accuracy:** The 90% accuracy rate, despite output issues, indicates a strong underlying capability.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Answer Formatting/Extraction:** Fails to consistently extract *only* the required answer in the correct format, often prepending with \"Verification:\" or providing verbose explanations when not needed.\n*   **Inconsistent Output:** The verbosity and style of answers vary significantly, even for similar question types.\n*   **Flawed Initial Verification:** The initial assessment of correctness can be incorrect, potentially leading to misleading responses.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary focus should be on **Answer Formatting and Extraction.** This single change will likely have the most significant positive impact on the system's usability and reliability. Getting the right information is only half the battle; the system must communicate it clearly and concisely.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Strict Output Formatting Rules:** Define explicit formatting rules for each question type. For example:\n    *   Numerical answers: Output only the number.\n    *   Entity answers (names, dates, places): Output only the entity name.\n    *   Explanatory answers:  Have a boolean parameter for *requiring* the explanation, if this exists.\n2.  **Eliminate Unnecessary \"Verification:\" Prefix:**  Completely remove the \"Verification:\" prefix unless there's a *specific*, documented reason to include it (e.g., explicitly requested by the user in a debug mode). Remove it entirely from a production version of the code.\n3.  **Refactor Answer Extraction Logic:** The code responsible for extracting the final answer needs to be thoroughly reviewed. Ensure that it's accessing the correct variables and that it's designed to extract *only* the necessary information. Ensure proper isolation of this section from other parts of the code.\n4.  **Add Answer Validation Step (Post-Extraction):** After extracting the answer, add a quick validation step to ensure that it conforms to the expected format for the question type. This could include checking for numerical values, removing extraneous characters, etc.\n5.  **Implement Unit Tests for Answer Formatting:** Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests specifically designed to verify the output formatting for different question types and scenarios. This will help prevent regressions as the system evolves.\n6.  **Review the Reasoning/Fact Verification step**: Check for inconsistencies in the reasoning process to ensure correct assessment of the correctness of the answer.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the error analysis and execution outputs, the capabilities appear to be **stable but underperforming.** The system has a solid foundation in information extraction and reasoning, but the output issues prevent it from reaching its full potential.

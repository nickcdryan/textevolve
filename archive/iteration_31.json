  "approach_summary": "The script implements a Chain of Thought approach with specialized LLM roles for information extraction and question answering. The problem is decomposed into information extraction, search query generation, information retrieval, answer extraction, and validation steps. The agent roles involved are information extraction expert, validation expert, search query generator, search engine simulator, answer extraction expert, and fact validator.\n\nThe functions used are `extract_info` (extracts key information), `validate_extraction` (validates the extracted information), `generate_search_query` (generates a search query), `retrieve_info` (retrieves information using the search query), `extract_answer` (extracts the answer), and `validate_answer` (validates the final answer). The overall workflow involves extracting information, validating the extraction, generating a search query, retrieving information, extracting the answer, and validating the answer, using `call_llm` to call the LLM in each function.",

This suggests that the code execution itself is not the primary source of the errors.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Numerical Answer Handling:** The system correctly handles numerical answers and can even include the unit when appropriate (e.g., \"5 years\" in sample 1), indicating a degree of understanding about answer context.\n2.  **Semantic Equivalence Recognition:** The system can identify semantic equivalence between answers presented with slightly different wording (e.g., \"5 years\" vs \"5\").\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inability to Discriminate Between Similar Information:** The system struggles to differentiate between answers that are relevant but ultimately incorrect, choosing a plausible but wrong answer over the actual correct one. This suggests a problem with nuanced information recall or filtering.\n2.  **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system appears to lack a deep understanding of context within the questions, specifically related to nuances of quotes or episode titles.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Insufficiently Precise Information Retrieval:** The system retrieves information related to the question topic but fails to pinpoint the *exact* answer required. It's likely pulling candidate answers that are too broad or generic.\n2.  **Weak Contextual Reasoning:** The system struggles to properly understand the nuanced context of questions, particularly those involving quotes or specific episodes of a series.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent pattern across the error cases is the selection of a relevant but incorrect answer. The system seems to be retrieving information based on keywords but lacks the ability to filter and prioritize the precise information needed.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the system's **failure to perform precise information retrieval based on contextual understanding.** This leads to the selection of plausible but ultimately incorrect answers. The system's information retrieval process must be refined to consider the specific context and constraints presented in the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval Precision:** Improve the system's ability to retrieve the most precise information from a knowledge base based on the question's context.\n2.  **Contextual Understanding:** Enhance the system's understanding of context, particularly when dealing with quotes, specific episodes of a series, or nuanced descriptions.\n3.  **Answer Verification Rigor:** Strengthen the verification process to rigorously compare candidate answers against the specific criteria established in the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Information Retrieval Queries:** Modify the information retrieval queries to include more specific keywords and constraints derived from the question. For example, when the question includes \"Series 1, Episode 17\", ensure that this information is explicitly included in the search query.\n2.  **Implement a Multi-Stage Filtering Process:** Add a filtering stage after the initial information retrieval to remove candidate answers that do not precisely match the question's constraints. This could involve using techniques like semantic similarity comparison or rule-based filtering.\n3.  **Incorporate Contextual Reasoning:** Incorporate contextual reasoning techniques such as using question answering models capable of understanding the nuances of the question, and then comparing the extracted answer from the model to the answer directly obtained.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracted relevant information about *Space: 1999*)\n    *   solution_generation: Incorrect (generated a plausible but wrong answer)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify that the answer matched the specific episode number)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (chose the incorrect answer)\n\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracted relevant information about *Devil May Cry 5* and Vergil)\n    *   solution_generation: Incorrect (generated a plausible but wrong answer)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify that the answer was specifically about Nero and bedtime)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (chose the incorrect answer)\n",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nHere's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal the following:\n\n*   **`ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` Markers:** The presence of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` suggests a consistent output formatting mechanism. This is good for parsing and downstream processing.\n*   **Answer Length Variation:** The answers vary in length, from a short numerical value (\"5 years\") to a longer quote (\"You're just dead weight.\") to a longer string of characters (\"The Guardian of Piri\"). The system can seemingly handle a range of output lengths and datatypes.\n*   **Lack of Formatting within Answers:** There's no formatting (e.g., bolding, italics) within the extracted answers. This may or may not be a weakness, depending on the task requirements.\n*   **Evidence of Information Extraction:** In each case, the system has extracted *something* related to the question. The problem isn't a complete failure to retrieve information; rather, it's retrieving the *wrong* information or incomplete information.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates basic information retrieval and answer generation capabilities. It can identify relevant entities and concepts within questions, extract corresponding information, and format it according to predefined markers. However, its accuracy is significantly hampered by a lack of precision in information retrieval and an inadequate understanding of context. The system struggles to discriminate between plausible but incorrect answers and the actual correct answer.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system consistently uses `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` markers, facilitating reliable parsing.\n*   **Handling of Numerical and Textual Answers:** The system can extract and present both numerical and textual answers, including units.\n*   **Semantic Understanding:** The system can understand and identify semantic equivalence between answers, as seen with '5 years' vs '5'.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Precise Information Retrieval:** The system frequently returns plausible but incorrect answers, indicating a lack of precision in its retrieval mechanism. This is the single most impactful weakness.\n*   **Contextual Reasoning:** The system's understanding of question context is limited, leading to errors in question answering tasks with subtle nuances.\n*   **Answer Verification:** The system lacks a robust verification step to ensure that the generated answer precisely matches the question's constraints.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe **single most important capability to focus on improving** is **Precise Information Retrieval**. Addressing this weakness will have the most significant impact on the system's overall accuracy and performance.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo improve the precision of information retrieval, implement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Query Expansion with Contextual Keywords:** When constructing retrieval queries, include not only the primary keywords from the question but also keywords that capture the contextual nuances. For example, if the question mentions \"Series 1, Episode 17\", ensure these are explicitly included in the query. If a quote is present, include that quote, along with who said it. This forces the system to search within a more specific context.\n2.  **Implement a Re-ranking Stage Based on Semantic Similarity:** After the initial retrieval, implement a re-ranking stage that uses semantic similarity to rank candidate answers based on their alignment with the question's overall meaning and constraints. This could involve using pre-trained language models to calculate semantic similarity scores between the question and each candidate answer. Answers with higher scores should be prioritized.\n3.  **Introduce a Filtering Mechanism Based on Entity Matching:** Implement a filtering mechanism that checks for the presence of key entities (e.g., specific episode titles, character names) mentioned in the question within the candidate answers. Discard any answers that do not contain these entities. This will help eliminate irrelevant or less precise answers.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the low accuracy score (0.33), the system's capabilities are currently **stable but low**. Without targeted improvements, the system will likely continue to produce similar results, resulting in consistent errors. The suggested improvements aim to shift the trend towards **improving** by enhancing the precision and context-awareness of the information retrieval process.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) were found in the provided output fields. This suggests that the code execution itself is not the primary source of the errors.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Numerical Answer Handling:** The system correctly handles numerical answers and can even include the unit when appropriate (e.g., \"5 years\" in sample 1), indicating a degree of understanding about answer context.\n2.  **Semantic Equivalence Recognition:** The system can identify semantic equivalence between answers presented with slightly different wording (e.g., \"5 years\" vs \"5\").\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inability to Discriminate Between Similar Information:** The system struggles to differentiate between answers that are relevant but ultimately incorrect, choosing a plausible but wrong answer over the actual correct one. This suggests a problem with nuanced information recall or filtering.\n2.  **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system appears to lack a deep understanding of context within the questions, specifically related to nuances of quotes or episode titles.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Insufficiently Precise Information Retrieval:** The system retrieves information related to the question topic but fails to pinpoint the *exact* answer required. It's likely pulling candidate answers that are too broad or generic.\n2.  **Weak Contextual Reasoning:** The system struggles to properly understand the nuanced context of questions, particularly those involving quotes or specific episodes of a series.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent pattern across the error cases is the selection of a relevant but incorrect answer. The system seems to be retrieving information based on keywords but lacks the ability to filter and prioritize the precise information needed.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the system's **failure to perform precise information retrieval based on contextual understanding.** This leads to the selection of plausible but ultimately incorrect answers. The system's information retrieval process must be refined to consider the specific context and constraints presented in the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval Precision:** Improve the system's ability to retrieve the most precise information from a knowledge base based on the question's context.\n2.  **Contextual Understanding:** Enhance the system's understanding of context, particularly when dealing with quotes, specific episodes of a series, or nuanced descriptions.\n3.  **Answer Verification Rigor:** Strengthen the verification process to rigorously compare candidate answers against the specific criteria established in the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Information Retrieval Queries:** Modify the information retrieval queries to include more specific keywords and constraints derived from the question. For example, when the question includes \"Series 1, Episode 17\", ensure that this information is explicitly included in the search query.\n2.  **Implement a Multi-Stage Filtering Process:** Add a filtering stage after the initial information retrieval to remove candidate answers that do not precisely match the question's constraints. This could involve using techniques like semantic similarity comparison or rule-based filtering.\n3.  **Incorporate Contextual Reasoning:** Incorporate contextual reasoning techniques such as using question answering models capable of understanding the nuances of the question, and then comparing the extracted answer from the model to the answer directly obtained.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracted relevant information about *Space: 1999*)\n    *   solution_generation: Incorrect (generated a plausible but wrong answer)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify that the answer matched the specific episode number)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (chose the incorrect answer)\n\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracted relevant information about *Devil May Cry 5* and Vergil)\n    *   solution_generation: Incorrect (generated a plausible but wrong answer)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify that the answer was specifically about Nero and bedtime)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (chose the incorrect answer)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nHere's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal the following:\n\n*   **`ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` Markers:** The presence of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` suggests a consistent output formatting mechanism. This is good for parsing and downstream processing.\n*   **Answer Length Variation:** The answers vary in length, from a short numerical value (\"5 years\") to a longer quote (\"You're just dead weight.\") to a longer string of characters (\"The Guardian of Piri\"). The system can seemingly handle a range of output lengths and datatypes.\n*   **Lack of Formatting within Answers:** There's no formatting (e.g., bolding, italics) within the extracted answers. This may or may not be a weakness, depending on the task requirements.\n*   **Evidence of Information Extraction:** In each case, the system has extracted *something* related to the question. The problem isn't a complete failure to retrieve information; rather, it's retrieving the *wrong* information or incomplete information.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates basic information retrieval and answer generation capabilities. It can identify relevant entities and concepts within questions, extract corresponding information, and format it according to predefined markers. However, its accuracy is significantly hampered by a lack of precision in information retrieval and an inadequate understanding of context. The system struggles to discriminate between plausible but incorrect answers and the actual correct answer.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system consistently uses `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` markers, facilitating reliable parsing.\n*   **Handling of Numerical and Textual Answers:** The system can extract and present both numerical and textual answers, including units.\n*   **Semantic Understanding:** The system can understand and identify semantic equivalence between answers, as seen with '5 years' vs '5'.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Precise Information Retrieval:** The system frequently returns plausible but incorrect answers, indicating a lack of precision in its retrieval mechanism. This is the single most impactful weakness.\n*   **Contextual Reasoning:** The system's understanding of question context is limited, leading to errors in question answering tasks with subtle nuances.\n*   **Answer Verification:** The system lacks a robust verification step to ensure that the generated answer precisely matches the question's constraints.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe **single most important capability to focus on improving** is **Precise Information Retrieval**. Addressing this weakness will have the most significant impact on the system's overall accuracy and performance.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTo improve the precision of information retrieval, implement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Query Expansion with Contextual Keywords:** When constructing retrieval queries, include not only the primary keywords from the question but also keywords that capture the contextual nuances.

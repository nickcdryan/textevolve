The approach also uses an adaptive example selection strategy,\n# choosing relevant training examples based on similarity to the input grid, and includes detailed validation steps to ensure the LLM\n# is producing valid outputs.

  "approach_summary": "The script addresses grid transformation problems by employing an LLM to identify visual anchors, infer transformation rules based on these anchors, and then apply these rules to generate a transformed grid. The problem is decomposed into three main steps: identifying anchors, inferring rules, and applying the transformation, each handled by a dedicated function. There are no distinct agent roles, instead the functions `identify_visual_anchors`, `infer_transformation_rules`, and `apply_transformation` sequentially use the `call_llm` function with specific system instructions and prompts to leverage the LLM's reasoning capabilities at each step, with `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrating the overall process. The overall workflow is `solve_grid_transformation` -> (`identify_visual_anchors` -> `call_llm`), (`infer_transformation_rules` -> `call_llm`), (`apply_transformation` -> `call_llm`).",

However, the system produces incorrect answers in a JSON format, indicating logical errors in reasoning, not technical errors.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system can identify that the task is to transform the input grid based on a pattern observed in the training examples.\n2.  **Preservation of Structure:** The system mostly maintains the structure of the input grid, even when the values are transformed incorrectly.\n3.  **Correct JSON Output:** The system successfully generates output in the requested JSON format.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Incorrect Pattern Interpretation:** The system fails to accurately interpret the transformation pattern from training examples. The substitution of digits is often incorrect, and fails to identify when areas should be transformed.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning:** The system exhibits poor spatial reasoning, failing to correctly apply the transformation logic across the entire grid. Specifically, the boundaries of the transformed regions are often wrong.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Pattern Extraction and Application:** The most critical bottleneck is the inability to accurately extract the transformation pattern from training examples and apply it to the test input. This stems from a misunderstanding of how to map values and spatial locations from the input grid to the output grid.\n2.  **Contextual Understanding:** There is a failure to properly utilize the context of neighboring cells when determining the correct transformation for a given cell. The system does not properly apply the transformations based on different regions within the grid.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe errors exhibit the following recurring patterns:\n\n*   **Inconsistent Transformation:** The identified digit transformation is not consistently applied.\n*   **Boundary Misinterpretation:** The region of transformation is inaccurately defined, often missing parts of the grid that should be changed or altering parts that should remain the same.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **faulty pattern recognition and application**. The system struggles to correctly identify the rules governing the transformations between input and output grids in the training examples, and therefore incorrectly modifies the test input.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Enhance the system's ability to accurately extract transformation rules from training examples by developing a more robust pattern recognition algorithm.\n2.  **Spatial Reasoning:** Improve spatial reasoning to enable the system to correctly determine the scope and boundaries of transformations. Implement mechanisms to consider neighborhood context when making transformations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Develop a transformation rule extraction module:** This module should analyze training examples and explicitly define the rules used to transform the grids. It should consider the relationships between different values and their positions within the grid. This may involve techniques like image convolution or graph analysis.\n2.  **Implement a spatial context analysis module:** This module should analyze the local neighborhood of each cell in the grid and use this information to refine the transformation rules. It should detect boundaries between regions and adapt the transformation accordingly.\n3.  **Introduce intermediate validation steps:** Include steps where the system validates intermediate outputs against the constraints of the transformation rules. This can help catch errors early in the process and prevent them from propagating.\n4.  **Expand Training Data:** Increase the diversity and complexity of the training examples to expose the system to a wider range of possible transformations.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partial failure (extracted some information but didn't fully understand the patterns)\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failure (generated an incorrect solution due to misinterpretation of the transformation rule)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failure (did not catch the inconsistencies in transformation)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partial failure (extracted some information but didn't fully understand the patterns)\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failure (generated an incorrect solution due to misinterpretation of the transformation rule)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failure (did not catch the inconsistencies in transformation)\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using chain-of-thought reasoning with an LLM. It decomposes the problem into identifying a \"transformation propagation network\" (rules for how elements influence each other) and then applying this network to a test grid. The LLM acts as an agent skilled in pattern recognition and grid transformations.\n\nThe script uses three functions: `main` which serves as the entry point, `solve_grid_transformation` which orchestrates the solving of the problem, and `call_llm` which makes calls to the Gemini LLM. `solve_grid_transformation` first calls `call_llm` to extract the transformation propagation network and then calls `call_llm` again to apply the transformation to the input grid based on the extracted network. The overall workflow is to identify transformation rules and apply them to generate the output grid.",

(i/2, k), where k is the column index of the non-zero element in the input grid.\n*   **Rule:** Copy the source value to the destination location.\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n]\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Iterate through the input grid:** We need to examine each row and column.\n2.  **Identify odd rows:** We are only interested in rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13).\n3.  **Find non-zero elements in odd rows:**  In each odd row, locate the non-zero elements.\n4.  **Apply the rule:** For each non-zero element found at (i, j) in an odd row, copy its value to the output grid at position (i/2, j). Note that i/2 will be integer division (floor).\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\n\n*   **Row 1:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (1, 8).\n    *   Output: `output[1/2, 8]` which simplifies to `output[0, 8] = 8`\n*   **Row 3:** `[8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (3, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[3/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[1, 0] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (3, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[3/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[1, 3] = 8`\n\n*   **Row 5:** `[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (5, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[5/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[2, 0] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (5, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[5/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[2, 3] = 5`\n*   **Row 7:** `[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (7, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[7/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[3, 0] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (7, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[7/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[3, 3] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (7, 6)\n    *   Output: `output[7/2, 6]` which simplifies to `output[3, 6] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (7, 9)\n    *   Output: `output[7/2, 9]` which simplifies to `output[3, 9] = 8`\n\n*   **Row 9:** `[5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (9, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[9/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[4, 0] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (9, 2)\n    *   Output: `output[9/2, 2]` which simplifies to `output[4, 2] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (9, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[9/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[4, 3] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (9, 4)\n    *   Output: `output[9/2, 4]` which simplifies to `output[4, 4] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (9, 12)\n    *   Output: `output[9/2, 12]` which simplifies to `output[4, 12] = 8`\n\n*   **Row 11:** `[5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (11, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[11/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[5, 0] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (11, 1)\n    *   Output: `output[11/2, 1]` which simplifies to `output[5, 1] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (11, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[11/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[5, 3] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (11, 10)\n    *   Output: `output[11/2, 10]` which simplifies to `output[5, 10] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (11, 12)\n    *   Output: `output[11/2, 12]` which simplifies to `output[5, 12] = 8`\n\n*   **Row 13:** `[8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (13, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[13/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[6, 0] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (13, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[13/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[6, 3] = 8`\n\nThe output grid dimensions will be [14/2, 13] which simplifies to [7, 13].\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n  [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    input_grid = [\n      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n      [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n      [5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n      [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n      [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n    ]\n\n    output_rows = len(input_grid) // 2\n    output_cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0] * output_cols for _ in range(output_rows)]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(input_grid), 2):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[i])):\n            if input_grid[i][j] != 0:\n                output_grid[i // 2][j] = input_grid[i][j]\n    \n    return output_grid\n```\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n  [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

step.\n\n**Transformation Propagation Network:**\n\n*   **Source:** Non-zero elements in the input grid at indices (i, j) where i is odd.\n*   **Destination:** Elements in the output grid at indices (i/2, k), where k is the column index of the non-zero element in the input grid.\n*   **Rule:** Copy the source value to the destination location.\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0,

8]\n]\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Iterate through the input grid:** We need to examine each row and column.\n2.  **Identify odd rows:** We are only interested in rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13).\n3.  **Find non-zero elements in odd rows:**  In each odd row, locate the non-zero elements.\n4.  **Apply the rule:** For each non-zero element found at (i, j) in an odd row, copy its value to the output grid at position (i/2, j). Note that i/2 will be integer division (floor).\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\n\n*   **Row 1:** `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (1, 8).\n    *   Output: `output[1/2, 8]` which simplifies to `output[0, 8] = 8`\n*   **Row 3:** `[8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (3, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[3/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[1, 0] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (3, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[3/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[1, 3] = 8`\n\n*   **Row 5:** `[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (5, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[5/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[2, 0] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (5, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[5/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[2, 3] = 5`\n*   **Row 7:** `[5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (7, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[7/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[3, 0] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (7, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[7/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[3, 3] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (7, 6)\n    *   Output: `output[7/2, 6]` which simplifies to `output[3, 6] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (7, 9)\n    *   Output: `output[7/2, 9]` which simplifies to `output[3, 9] = 8`\n\n*   **Row 9:** `[5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (9, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[9/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[4, 0] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (9, 2)\n    *   Output: `output[9/2, 2]` which simplifies to `output[4, 2] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (9, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[9/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[4, 3] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (9, 4)\n    *   Output: `output[9/2, 4]` which simplifies to `output[4, 4] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (9, 12)\n    *   Output: `output[9/2, 12]` which simplifies to `output[4, 12] = 8`\n\n*   **Row 11:** `[5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (11, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[11/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[5, 0] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (11, 1)\n    *   Output: `output[11/2, 1]` which simplifies to `output[5, 1] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 5 at index (11, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[11/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[5, 3] = 5`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (11, 10)\n    *   Output: `output[11/2, 10]` which simplifies to `output[5, 10] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (11, 12)\n    *   Output: `output[11/2, 12]` which simplifies to `output[5, 12] = 8`\n\n*   **Row 13:** `[8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (13, 0)\n    *   Output: `output[13/2, 0]` which simplifies to `output[6, 0] = 8`\n    *   Non-zero element: 8 at index (13, 3)\n    *   Output: `output[13/2, 3]` which simplifies to `output[6, 3] = 8`\n\nThe output grid dimensions will be [14/2, 13] which simplifies to [7, 13].\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n  [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    input_grid = [\n      [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n      [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n      [5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n      [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n      [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8]\n    ]\n\n    output_rows = len(input_grid) // 2\n    output_cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0] * output_cols for _ in range(output_rows)]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(input_grid), 2):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[i])):\n            if input_grid[i][j] != 0:\n                output_grid[i // 2][j] = input_grid[i][j]\n    \n    return output_grid\n```\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 0, 8, 5, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n  [5, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n  [8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

The logic within the generated code is often flawed, leading to incorrect transformations.\n*   **Misinterpretation of transformation patterns:** In some cases, the system misinterprets the transformation pattern, leading to the application of an entirely different rule than intended.\n*   **Dimension mismatch:**  The system does not dynamically detect the output grid's dimensions based on the sample input data but, instead, tries to hard code the new dimensions.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Flawed logic within the code generation:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to translate the extracted transformation rules into correct and efficient code. The generated code often contains errors in indexing, iteration, or conditional logic, leading to incorrect transformations.\n*   **Inability to dynamically determine output dimensions:** The system makes assumptions about the output grid's dimensions, which could lead to problems in processing samples with different dimensions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect indexing:** There are instances of incorrect array indexing when applying transformations.  This causes the values to be placed in the wrong locations in the output grid.\n*   **Overwriting values:** In cases where the transformation involves applying values to a region, the system sometimes overwrites values that should be preserved, or doesn't copy the values correctly.\n*   **Incorrect neighbour selection:** Logic that has been generated is selecting the wrong neighbours in some instances.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the system's inability to translate the extracted transformation rules into logically sound and error-free code. The incorrect code then executes to produce a faulty, incorrect result grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Code generation logic:** The most significant improvement area is in the code generation logic. The system needs to be better at translating the extracted transformation rules into syntactically correct and semantically accurate Python code. Focus on array index calculations, loop conditions, conditional statements, and value assignments.\n*   **Dynamic dimension detection:** The system should be able to dynamically determine the dimensions of the output grid based on the input grid and the transformation rules. This eliminates hardcoding dimensions, making the system more robust to variations in input data.\n*   **Verification of transformation logic:** Before generating code, add a verification step where the system attempts to verify its understanding of the transformation logic. This could involve a simplified simulation of the transformation on a small subset of the input grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement unit tests:**  Develop a suite of unit tests to specifically target the code generation module. These tests should cover a variety of transformation rules and input grid dimensions.\n*   **Introduce an intermediate representation:** Use an intermediate representation to first structure the extracted rules before converting them into code.  This representation would be easier to analyze, debug and verify than raw text.  For instance, the intermediate representation could define operations like \"copy value from (x, y) to (x', y')\", \"apply value to rectangle ((x1, y1), (x2, y2))\", \"check neighbors of (x, y)\" etc.\n*   **Refine the code generation algorithm:** Design and implement a more robust algorithm for code generation that considers potential errors in array indexing, loop conditions, and conditional statements. Consider using established code generation techniques and libraries.\n*   **Implement runtime checks:** Insert runtime checks into the generated code to verify that array accesses are within bounds and that the values being assigned are of the correct type.

The generated Python code, however, produces incorrect results. The code's logic regarding array indexing and iteration is flawed, leading to incorrect population of the output grid. Even if the reasoning *appears* correct at first glance, the code does not properly translate this logic into correct operations on the grid.\n*   **Sample ID 2 (Adjacent Value Transformation):** The system correctly identifies the transformation rule. However, there's no code generated to back this reasoning and apply the rule onto the test input grid. The generated text contains a correct description of the desired functionality, but then stops short of converting this functionality into code.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates a moderate capability in extracting and understanding transformation rules. However, it exhibits very low capability in applying these rules to generate correct output grids. The core bottleneck lies in the inability to translate the extracted understanding into functional and accurate code. The system demonstrates a good ability to provide textual reasoning about the transformation process, but this strength is rendered ineffective due to the flawed code generation stage or a missing code generation stage.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Rule Extraction:** The system can generally identify and extract transformation rules from training examples.\n*   **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  The system attempts to provide step-by-step reasoning, which aids in understanding the transformation.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Code Generation:** This is the most critical weakness. The generated code is frequently incorrect, containing errors in indexing, iteration, and conditional logic. In the case of sample 2, no code is generated at all.\n*   **Output Accuracy:** The incorrect code leads to inaccurate output grids.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe primary focus must be on improving the **Code Generation Logic**.  The system needs to accurately translate the extracted transformation rules into functional and error-free code.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Unit Tests for Code Generation:** Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests specifically targeting the code generation module. These tests should cover a variety of transformation rules, input grid dimensions, and edge cases.  Focus on testing individual components of the code generation process, such as array indexing and loop conditions.\n\n2.  **Introduce Intermediate Representation (IR):** Implement an intermediate representation to structure the extracted rules before code conversion. This IR should abstract away from the raw text, making it easier to analyze, debug, and verify. The IR can define operations like \"copy value from (x, y) to (x', y')\", \"apply value to rectangle ((x1, y1), (x2, y2))\", and \"check neighbors of (x, y)\". By introducing this intermediate stage, the transformation logic can be verified more easily.\n\n3.  **Refine Code Generation Algorithm with Established Techniques:** Redesign the code generation algorithm to be more robust and consider potential errors. Research and incorporate established code generation techniques and libraries to improve the quality of generated code. Use templates, abstract syntax trees, and consider static analysis techniques to catch errors early in the process.\n\n4.  **Implement Runtime Checks within the Generated Code:**  Insert runtime checks within the generated code to verify array accesses are within bounds, and that values assigned are of the correct type. This will help catch errors during execution and provide more informative debugging messages. For example, include `assert` statements to validate conditions.\n\n5.  **Code Generation Completion:** The system must *always* generate code if it has successfully extracted a rule. It cannot provide a textual description alone. This is critical to end-to-end execution.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nThe system's capabilities are currently **stable but ineffective**. While the rule extraction and reasoning are moderately good, the inability to generate correct code nullifies any potential value. Improvements are needed to move the trend to \"improving\".\n",

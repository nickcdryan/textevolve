The `propose_meeting_time` function then uses the extracted information and LLM to propose a valid meeting time. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini LLM, and the overall workflow involves extracting meeting information and then proposing a meeting time using LLM reasoning.",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n**Sample 1:** The system correctly identifies the need for a 60-minute meeting for three participants (Thomas, Dylan, Jerry). It accurately parses their individual availabilities. It correctly identifies common available time slots. It correctly reasons that the 11:00-11:30 slot is not long enough. It then proposes a valid time slot (14:30-15:30) that meets the duration and availability constraints. This sample demonstrates strong reasoning and accurate constraint handling.\n\n**Sample 2:** The system attempts to schedule a meeting for Sandra and Adam. The *reasoning is flawed*: The system claims \"On Tuesday, Sandra is available 14:00-14:30 and Adam is available 15:00-16:00 so there is no overlap.\" This is a correct assessment but the system still moves forward to other days when a correct assessment should provide an answer.  The rest of the reasoning attempts to combine the schedules of Sandra and Adam on Wednesday and Thursday but makes the critical extraction error: Sandra is only available on Tuesday 14:00-14:30, Wednesday 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-15:00, and Thursday 11:30-12:30. Adam is available on Tuesday 9:00-12:30, 15:00-16:00, Wednesday 10:30-12:00, 14:00-14:30, 15:30-16:00, and Thursday 9:30-12:00, 13:30-17:00. The common slots are 10:30-11:00, 11:30-12:00, 14:00-14:30. The *extraction error*: the system says a common slot is 14:00-14:30, but Adam is only available 14:00-14:30 and *Sandra isn't available at all at that time.* On the one hand, the system correctly reasons that the meeting can be scheduled for on Wednesday or Thursday. It suggests Wednesday 10:30-11:00, which *is a valid time* *with the faulty Sandra information.* The ultimate answer isn't totally wrong but it depends on faulty availability extraction.\n\n**Sample 3:** The system is scheduling a meeting for Frances and Christina and needs to identify the earliest time. The system says \"The earliest time slot available is on Monday at 10:30 for 30 minutes, as both Frances and Christina are available then.\" This *might* be a correct time slot (given the entire schedule) but *the available data provided in the ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT says Frances has a meeting 10:00 to 10:30.* So this is not a correct assessment and violates the provided constraints.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits a mixed bag of capabilities. It demonstrates strong reasoning when accurate information is provided (Sample 1). However, it is highly susceptible to errors stemming from flawed information extraction, particularly concerning participant availability (Samples 2 and 3). It also struggles with consistently prioritizing constraints like \"earliest availability.\" The sample of scheduling times for two people is incorrect because the system did not accurately assess Frances' schedule. In summary, it sometimes is correct, but sometimes has flawed input and/or logic, leading to bad answers.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Reasoning Ability (Conditional):** When provided with accurate input, the system can effectively reason about meeting duration, participant availability, and common time slots.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The system can identify constraints mentioned in the problem description, such as meeting duration and participant availability.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Extraction Accuracy (CRITICAL):** The system struggles to accurately extract and represent participant availability information from the text descriptions. This is the most pressing weakness.\n*   **Constraint Adherence (Inconsistent):** Even when constraints are identified, the system doesn't always rigorously adhere to them during solution generation and verification.  This is particularly evident in the \"earliest availability\" constraint, which is frequently missed.\n*   **Error Propagation:** Flaws in the initial information extraction stage propagate through the entire reasoning process, leading to incorrect final answers.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction Accuracy**, specifically the accurate determination of participant availability. This capability is the foundation for all subsequent reasoning and constraint handling.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement the Verification Agent:** As suggested in the original report, implement a \"Verification Agent\" which explicitly checks the proposed time slot against each participant's schedule *before* proposing the time. The Verification Agent should return a boolean (True/False) indicating if the time slot is valid. The verification agent should be designed so that if the validation fails, it should provide feedback that is incorporated to further refine the results.\n2.  **Structured Availability Output (Mandatory):** Force the system to output the structured availability information in a structured format (JSON).\n3.  **Few-Shot Example Variation:** Add additional few-shot examples that address these problems:\n    *   Few-shot examples with slightly overlapping times (to address Example 3.)\n    *   Few-shot examples to explicitly address extraction problems (address Example 2.)\n4.  **Re-Act loop with external Calculator Agent:** If errors still occur, incorporate the ability to use an external calculator agent to double check date and time arithmetic, especially when time calculations are complex (e.g., spanning across days). This will prevent arithmetic errors. (As suggested.)\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is **Unstable**. The system has the potential to provide good reasoning. There are too many problems with extracting accurate information. The system appears to be relying on imperfect information, and makes conclusions that are not supported by evidence.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a meta-reasoning agent to dynamically select a strategy for solving grid transformation problems. The problem is decomposed into strategy selection and strategy application. Two agent roles are involved: a meta-reasoning agent for strategy selection and a strategy execution agent. Other functions used are `call_llm` to interact with the LLM and `solve_grid_transformation` to orchestrate the process.\n\nThe workflow is as follows: `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which calls `select_strategy` to choose a strategy using `call_llm`, and then calls `apply_chosen_strategy` to apply the selected strategy, again using `call_llm`, and returns the transformed grid.",

Some rows are unchanged.\n*   **Example 2:** `[9, 2, 4] -> [2, 9, 2]`, `[2, 4, 4] -> [4, 4, 2]`, `[2, 9, 2] -> [4, 2, 9]`.\n*   **Example 3:** `[8, 8, 8] -> [5, 5, 8]`, `[5, 5, 8] -> [8, 5, 5]`, `[8, 5, 5] -> [8, 8, 8]`.\n*   **Example 4:** `[3, 2, 9] -> [3, 3, 2]`, `[9, 9, 9] -> [9, 9, 9]`, `[2, 3, 3] -> [9, 2, 3]`.\n\nIt's not a simple rotation.

The ability to correctly decompose and interpret the transformations is fundamentally flawed.\n*   **Rule Consistency Verification:** Lack of robust verification of extracted rules across all training examples. The system needs to more thoroughly test its extracted rules to ensure consistency.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Reflection Misinterpretation (Sample 2 & 3):** The system tends to misinterpret patterns as simple reflections when more complex transformations are involved.\n*   **Corner Rotation Errors (Sample 0):** Incorrect execution of the seemingly simple \"rotate corners\" transformation.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is **inaccurate pattern interpretation and subsequent rule extraction**. The system frequently identifies patterns that are only partially correct or misinterprets the nature of the transformation (e.g., reflection, rotation, propagation).

This will provide greater visibility into the system's reasoning and help identify the exact point where errors occur. The most valuable intermediate outputs would be the \"explicit rule\" at each stage and the transformed grid at each step of processing.\n*   **Implement Rule Verification Function:** Create a function that explicitly checks the validity of a derived rule against all training examples.

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Overall Performance:** The AI system achieved an accuracy of 0.00 (0/3). All three provided error samples demonstrate significant issues with pattern recognition, rule extraction, and application of these rules to transform the input grid.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several recurring issues in the system's reasoning and implementation:\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Identification and Rule Derivation:** The system struggles to correctly identify the underlying transformation patterns. The reasoning often jumps to conclusions based on limited observations, leading to the extraction of incorrect rules. For example, in Sample 0, the system initially identifies a corner rotation pattern, but the Python code implementing this rule is flawed (swapping with the *second* element of the row in some cases), and the description of how the code should be executed does not match with the output generated.\n*   **Inconsistent Rule Application:** Even when a potentially correct rule is identified, the system fails to consistently apply it. This suggests a problem with the logic used to translate the extracted rules into code.\n*   **Confabulation and Lack of Self-Verification:** The explanations provided often do not align with the generated output. The system asserts that a specific rule is applied, but the resulting transformed grid does not reflect this application. There's a lack of robust self-verification to ensure the output matches the intended rule.\n*   **Strategy Selection Issues:** While the system attempts to choose an appropriate strategy, the chosen strategies (e.g., Explicit Rule Extraction) are not effectively implemented, highlighting that the system struggles to transform the chosen strategy into correct outputs.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Visual Similarity:** The \"Visual Feature Analysis\" often leads to incorrect assumptions about transformations, particularly when patterns appear similar but have subtle differences.\n*   **Lack of Rigorous Testing of Rules:** The system frequently infers rules from a small subset of the training examples without validating them against the entire dataset. This leads to the extraction of rules that only work in specific cases.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities in solving grid transformation problems. While it attempts to identify patterns and extract rules, it consistently fails to do so accurately or consistently. The primary weakness lies in the inability to accurately interpret patterns and translate these interpretations into correct transformations.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempts to Identify Patterns:** The system's effort to recognize patterns is a positive foundation to build upon.\n*   **Strategy Selection (Conceptual):** The system demonstrates an understanding of different problem-solving strategies, even if it struggles to implement them correctly.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition Accuracy:** The system fundamentally misinterprets patterns, leading to flawed rule extraction.\n*   **Rule Application:** The ability to translate extracted rules into accurate transformations is deficient.\n*   **Rule Validation:** The system lacks a robust mechanism for verifying the consistency of extracted rules across all training examples.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition Accuracy**. Until the system can reliably identify and interpret patterns within the grids, improvements in other areas will be limited.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Pattern Extraction Logic:**\n    *   Re-evaluate the logic used to extract patterns from the grids. The current approach seems overly simplistic and prone to misinterpretation.\n    *   Consider incorporating more sophisticated image processing techniques or machine learning models specifically designed for pattern recognition.\n    *   Implement a more structured approach to pattern decomposition, breaking down complex transformations into simpler, more manageable components (e.g., rotations, reflections, translations).\n    *   Focus on extracting *mathematical* relationships between grid elements, rather than relying solely on visual similarity.\n\n2.  **Implement Rule Verification Function:**\n    *   Create a dedicated function that explicitly checks the validity of a derived rule against **all** training examples.\n    *   This function should flag any inconsistencies or contradictions, providing specific feedback on where the rule fails.\n    *   The rule verification function should be run **before** attempting to apply the rule to the test input.\n\n3.  **Introduce Intermediate Checks and Detailed Logging:**\n    *   Insert print statements/intermediate outputs at various stages of the reasoning process to track the values of variables and the state of the grid.\n    *   Specifically, log the extracted rule at each stage and the transformed grid after each step of processing.\n    *   Implement a comprehensive error logging system to track the frequency and types of errors encountered during rule verification and application.\n\n4.  **Test Simple Cases First:**\n    *   Create a suite of test cases specifically designed to evaluate the system's ability to handle simple transformations like rotations, reflections, and translations.\n    *   Ensure the system can reliably solve these basic problems before tackling more complex transformations.\n\n5.  **Address Implementation Errors:**\n    *   Pay close attention to the correctness of the code generated for implementing the extracted rules. The Sample 0 example clearly demonstrated the system extracting the rotation rule correctly, but it failed to apply that rule correctly. The \"explicit rule\" in the sample is not the rule that the system ultimately executes.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0/3 accuracy), the capability trend is **declining**. The system needs significant improvements to address the identified weaknesses and begin demonstrating consistent progress.\n",

The errors are primarily logical and reasoning-based.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Identification:** The system attempts to identify patterns in the training examples, which is crucial for solving grid transformation problems.\n*   **Rule Extraction:** The system tries to extract explicit rules from the observed patterns and apply them to the test input.\n*   **Strategy Selection:** The system demonstrates an ability to select an appropriate strategy.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Pattern Interpretation:** The system often misinterprets the underlying patterns in the training examples, leading to the extraction of incorrect rules.\n*   **Inaccurate Rule Application:** Even when the correct pattern is identified, the system struggles to accurately apply the derived rules to the test input.\n*   **Overgeneralization:** The system sometimes overgeneralizes from a few examples, resulting in a rule that doesn't hold true for all cases.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition Accuracy:** The inaccurate recognition of patterns within the grids is the primary bottleneck. The ability to correctly decompose and interpret the transformations is fundamentally flawed.\n*   **Rule Consistency Verification:** Lack of robust verification of extracted rules across all training examples. The system needs to more thoroughly test its extracted rules to ensure consistency.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Reflection Misinterpretation (Sample 2 & 3):** The system tends to misinterpret patterns as simple reflections when more complex transformations are involved.\n*   **Corner Rotation Errors (Sample 0):** Incorrect execution of the seemingly simple \"rotate corners\" transformation.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is **inaccurate pattern interpretation and subsequent rule extraction**. The system frequently identifies patterns that are only partially correct or misinterprets the nature of the transformation (e.g., reflection, rotation, propagation). This leads to the derivation of incorrect rules that fail to generalize to the test input. The analysis of example 0 shows that even relatively simple corner rotation is improperly executed.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Enhance the pattern recognition capabilities to accurately identify complex relationships and transformations within the grids.\n*   **Rule Validation:** Implement a more rigorous rule validation process to ensure the extracted rules are consistent across all training examples. The system needs to explicitly test rules against each training example, rather than assuming their validity after observing only one or two examples.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Improve spatial reasoning abilities to better handle rotations, reflections, and other spatial transformations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Introduce Intermediate Checks:** Add print statements/intermediate outputs within the reasoning process to track the values of variables and the state of the grid at various stages. This will provide greater visibility into the system's reasoning and help identify the exact point where errors occur. The most valuable intermediate outputs would be the \"explicit rule\" at each stage and the transformed grid at each step of processing.\n*   **Implement Rule Verification Function:** Create a function that explicitly checks the validity of a derived rule against all training examples. This function should flag any inconsistencies or contradictions.\n*   **Refine Pattern Extraction Logic:** Re-evaluate the logic used to extract patterns from the grids. Consider incorporating more sophisticated image processing techniques or machine learning models for pattern recognition. This is especially critical because Visual Feature Analysis is not currently working effectively.\n*   **Test Simple Cases First:** Before tackling complex transformations, ensure the system can reliably handle simple transformations like rotations and reflections. Create a set of test cases specifically designed to evaluate these basic spatial reasoning skills.\n*   **Implement Visualization Tools:** Consider implementing tools to visualize the grid transformations. This could help developers better understand the patterns and identify potential errors in the system's reasoning.\n*   **Add Error Logging:** Log any errors or inconsistencies detected during the rule verification process. This will help track the frequency and types of errors that occur.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (Incorrect transformation)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (Did not catch the incorrect transformation)\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (Incorrectly identified key patterns in the grids)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (Generated an incorrect output grid based on the misinterpreted patterns)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (Incorrectly identified a pattern as mirroring, missing other important features)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (Generated the output based on the mirroring interpretation, which was flawed)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Overall Performance:** The AI system achieved an accuracy of 0.00 (0/3). All three provided error samples demonstrate significant issues with pattern recognition, rule extraction, and application of these rules to transform the input grid.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several recurring issues in the system's reasoning and implementation:\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Identification and Rule Derivation:** The system struggles to correctly identify the underlying transformation patterns. The reasoning often jumps to conclusions based on limited observations, leading to the extraction of incorrect rules. For example, in Sample 0, the system initially identifies a corner rotation pattern, but the Python code implementing this rule is flawed (swapping with the *second* element of the row in some cases), and the description of how the code should be executed does not match with the output generated.\n*   **Inconsistent Rule Application:** Even when a potentially correct rule is identified, the system fails to consistently apply it. This suggests a problem with the logic used to translate the extracted rules into code.\n*   **Confabulation and Lack of Self-Verification:** The explanations provided often do not align with the generated output. The system asserts that a specific rule is applied, but the resulting transformed grid does not reflect this application. There's a lack of robust self-verification to ensure the output matches the intended rule.\n*   **Strategy Selection Issues:** While the system attempts to choose an appropriate strategy, the chosen strategies (e.g., Explicit Rule Extraction) are not effectively implemented, highlighting that the system struggles to transform the chosen strategy into correct outputs.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Visual Similarity:** The \"Visual Feature Analysis\" often leads to incorrect assumptions about transformations, particularly when patterns appear similar but have subtle differences.\n*   **Lack of Rigorous Testing of Rules:** The system frequently infers rules from a small subset of the training examples without validating them against the entire dataset. This leads to the extraction of rules that only work in specific cases.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities in solving grid transformation problems. While it attempts to identify patterns and extract rules, it consistently fails to do so accurately or consistently. The primary weakness lies in the inability to accurately interpret patterns and translate these interpretations into correct transformations.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempts to Identify Patterns:** The system's effort to recognize patterns is a positive foundation to build upon.\n*   **Strategy Selection (Conceptual):** The system demonstrates an understanding of different problem-solving strategies, even if it struggles to implement them correctly.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition Accuracy:** The system fundamentally misinterprets patterns, leading to flawed rule extraction.\n*   **Rule Application:** The ability to translate extracted rules into accurate transformations is deficient.\n*   **Rule Validation:** The system lacks a robust mechanism for verifying the consistency of extracted rules across all training examples.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition Accuracy**. Until the system can reliably identify and interpret patterns within the grids, improvements in other areas will be limited.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Pattern Extraction Logic:**\n    *   Re-evaluate the logic used to extract patterns from the grids. The current approach seems overly simplistic and prone to misinterpretation.\n    *   Consider incorporating more sophisticated image processing techniques or machine learning models specifically designed for pattern recognition.\n    *   Implement a more structured approach to pattern decomposition, breaking down complex transformations into simpler, more manageable components (e.g., rotations, reflections, translations).\n    *   Focus on extracting *mathematical* relationships between grid elements, rather than relying solely on visual similarity.\n\n2.  **Implement Rule Verification Function:**\n    *   Create a dedicated function that explicitly checks the validity of a derived rule against **all** training examples.\n    *   This function should flag any inconsistencies or contradictions, providing specific feedback on where the rule fails.\n    *   The rule verification function should be run **before** attempting to apply the rule to the test input.\n\n3.  **Introduce Intermediate Checks and Detailed Logging:**\n    *   Insert print statements/intermediate outputs at various stages of the reasoning process to track the values of variables and the state of the grid.\n    *   Specifically, log the extracted rule at each stage and the transformed grid after each step of processing.\n    *   Implement a comprehensive error logging system to track the frequency and types of errors encountered during rule verification and application.\n\n4.  **Test Simple Cases First:**\n    *   Create a suite of test cases specifically designed to evaluate the system's ability to handle simple transformations like rotations, reflections, and translations.\n    *   Ensure the system can reliably solve these basic problems before tackling more complex transformations.\n\n5.  **Address Implementation Errors:**\n    *   Pay close attention to the correctness of the code generated for implementing the extracted rules. The Sample 0 example clearly demonstrated the system extracting the rotation rule correctly, but it failed to apply that rule correctly. The \"explicit rule\" in the sample is not the rule that the system ultimately executes.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0/3 accuracy), the capability trend is **declining**. The system needs significant improvements to address the identified weaknesses and begin demonstrating consistent progress.\n"

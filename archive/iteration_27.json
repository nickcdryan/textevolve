  "approach_summary": "This script uses multiple LLM-based agents to answer questions with a layered validation approach. The problem is decomposed into search, answer extraction, and validation steps. The agents include a search engine simulator, an answer extractor, a fact validator, a temporal validator, and a source reliability validator.\n\nThe core functions are `call_llm`, `simulate_search`, `extract_answer`, `fact_validator`, `temporal_validator`, `source_reliability_validator`, and `main`. `main` calls `simulate_search` to get results, then `extract_answer` to get an answer and its source. Finally, it calls `fact_validator`, `temporal_validator`, and `source_reliability_validator` to validate the answer.\n\nThe workflow involves simulating a search, extracting an answer, and then validating the answer using multiple specialized validators focusing on factuality, temporal consistency, and source reliability, returning the validated answer or error message.",

This suggests that the errors are primarily logical or knowledge-based, rather than due to code execution issues.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval:** The system successfully retrieves information from external sources, as evidenced by the presence of URLs in the `system_answer` fields (e.g., `onlinelibrary.wiley.com`, `isuresults.com`). This is a core strength.\n2.  **Confidence in Answer:** The system provides a specific answer instead of failing silently, suggesting a level of confidence and an attempt to address the question.\n3.  **Source Attribution:** The system attempts to provide sources for its answers, which is helpful for verification and debugging.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information:** The retrieved information is frequently incorrect, leading to wrong answers. This undermines the benefit of retrieving information in the first place.\n2.  **Lack of Verification:** The system doesn't seem to have a robust mechanism for verifying the accuracy of information retrieved from external sources. It trusts the source without independent confirmation.\n3.  **Placeholder Responses:** In sample_id 0, the system generated a placeholder response because it could not find an answer, but this doesn't explain the reasoning process.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Accuracy/Verification:** The most critical bottleneck is the system's inability to consistently retrieve and verify accurate information from external sources. The sources themselves may be unreliable, or the system may be misinterpreting the information.\n2.  **Lack of Reasoning/Consistency Checks:** The system doesn't appear to perform sufficient consistency checks on retrieved information or cross-reference multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Reliance on Single Source:** The system often appears to rely on a single external source for its answers, making it vulnerable to inaccuracies in that source.\n2.  **No Error Handling for Information Retrieval:** If the initial source is wrong, there is no process to determine if there is a better one or if the information is incorrect.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **lack of a robust information verification process**. The system needs to go beyond simply retrieving information from a source and implement strategies for validating its accuracy, such as cross-referencing multiple sources, applying logical constraints, or using common sense reasoning.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval and Validation:** Improve the accuracy and reliability of information retrieval by implementing validation mechanisms. This involves checking the credibility of sources and cross-referencing data from multiple sources.\n2.  **Reasoning and Consistency Checks:** Incorporate reasoning and consistency checks into the system's decision-making process. This will help identify and correct errors in the retrieved information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Source Approach:** Instead of relying on a single source, query multiple sources and compare the information retrieved.\n2.  **Develop a Source Credibility Ranking:** Assign credibility scores to different sources based on their historical accuracy and reliability. Prioritize information from more credible sources.\n3.  **Implement Data Validation Rules:** Create a set of data validation rules based on common sense reasoning and domain-specific knowledge. Use these rules to filter out obviously incorrect information.\n4.  **Introduce a \"No Answer\" Confidence Threshold:** If after consulting multiple sources, there is still no consensus or the confidence level is below a certain threshold, the system should return a \"No Answer\" response rather than a potentially incorrect answer.\n5. Add intermediate print statements for debugging so that you can understand the exact information being retrieved from the external sources, so the problem can be better understood and addressed.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct apparent visual magnitude.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate the correct numerical answer and defaulted to a placeholder.\n\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Extracted an incorrect year from `onlinelibrary.wiley.com`.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the accuracy of the extracted year.\n\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Extracted an incorrect birthdate from `isuresults.com`.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the accuracy of the extracted birthdate.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System Assessment\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly demonstrate a critical flaw: the system confidently provides incorrect answers. This is exacerbated by the inclusion of source information, which, while intended to improve transparency, actually highlights the system's inability to validate retrieved data.  The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest a structured output format, which is good. However, this structure is useless if the content within is incorrect. The system's over-reliance on potentially unreliable external sources, coupled with a lack of internal validation, results in inaccurate responses. The placeholder response in Sample 0 is preferable to the incorrect answers in Samples 1 and 2. Sample 1 uses an external website while Sample 2 uses a `.htm` format and it could be potentially failing in parsing it because of it's format.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses a basic information retrieval capability, demonstrated by its ability to identify and extract URLs and associated text from external sources. However, its overall capability is severely hampered by its inability to discern accurate information from inaccurate information. The current architecture heavily emphasizes information retrieval but almost completely neglects information validation. This leads to a system that is more likely to spread misinformation than provide correct answers, rendering it practically useless in its current state. The ability to cite sources is positive, but without accuracy, it provides a false sense of reliability.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:** The system can retrieve data from external sources. This is a foundational capability upon which other improvements can be built.\n*   **Structured Output:** The use of \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags indicates a structured approach to generating output, which is beneficial for downstream processing and analysis.\n*   **Source Attribution:** Attempts to attribute answers to sources.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Accuracy:** The system provides demonstrably incorrect answers, which is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Validation:** There is a near-complete absence of mechanisms to validate the accuracy of retrieved information.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Single Sources:** The system seems to trust a single source without cross-referencing or verifying the information.\n*   **Inability to parse different file types:** The system may fail to parse `.htm` files\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **information validation**. Without accurate information, all other capabilities are rendered irrelevant. The system *must* be able to determine the trustworthiness of sources and the veracity of the information retrieved.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Multi-Source Verification:** Modify the information retrieval process to query at least three independent sources for each fact.  Compare the retrieved information and prioritize data that is consistent across multiple sources.  If there are discrepancies, flag the data as potentially unreliable and attempt to resolve the conflict through further investigation or by deferring to a more authoritative source.\n2.  **Develop a Source Credibility Heuristic:** Create a scoring system to assess the credibility of different sources. Consider factors such as the source's reputation, expertise, and historical accuracy. Prioritize information from sources with higher credibility scores. This can be a simple lookup table initially, and iteratively improved as more data becomes available.\n3.  **Implement Data Validation Rules:**  Develop a set of data validation rules based on common sense reasoning, domain-specific knowledge, and logical constraints. For example, if retrieving a birthdate, ensure it falls within a reasonable range.  If retrieving a numerical value, check for outliers or inconsistencies with other known data.  Use these rules to filter out obviously incorrect information.\n4.  **Introduce a Confidence Threshold for \"No Answer\":** If, after consulting multiple sources and applying data validation rules, the system remains uncertain about the accuracy of a fact, it should return a \"No Answer\" response along with an explanation of why it could not provide a definitive answer.  This is preferable to providing incorrect information.\n5.  **Debug with Intermediate Print Statements:** Add detailed print statements within the information retrieval and validation code. These print statements should output the exact queries being sent to external sources, the raw data being retrieved, the results of any validation checks, and the final answer being generated. This will allow you to trace the system's reasoning process and identify the specific points at which errors are occurring. Include checking file type before running parsing to see if `.htm` file is causing errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **declining**. While the system demonstrates the ability to retrieve and present information, its inability to ensure accuracy renders it detrimental. Without significant improvements in information validation, the system's value will continue to decrease.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no explicit runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) reported in the provided 'output' fields. This suggests that the errors are primarily logical or knowledge-based, rather than due to code execution issues.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval:** The system successfully retrieves information from external sources, as evidenced by the presence of URLs in the `system_answer` fields (e.g., `onlinelibrary.wiley.com`, `isuresults.com`). This is a core strength.\n2.  **Confidence in Answer:** The system provides a specific answer instead of failing silently, suggesting a level of confidence and an attempt to address the question.\n3.  **Source Attribution:** The system attempts to provide sources for its answers, which is helpful for verification and debugging.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information:** The retrieved information is frequently incorrect, leading to wrong answers. This undermines the benefit of retrieving information in the first place.\n2.  **Lack of Verification:** The system doesn't seem to have a robust mechanism for verifying the accuracy of information retrieved from external sources. It trusts the source without independent confirmation.\n3.  **Placeholder Responses:** In sample_id 0, the system generated a placeholder response because it could not find an answer, but this doesn't explain the reasoning process.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Accuracy/Verification:** The most critical bottleneck is the system's inability to consistently retrieve and verify accurate information from external sources. The sources themselves may be unreliable, or the system may be misinterpreting the information.\n2.  **Lack of Reasoning/Consistency Checks:** The system doesn't appear to perform sufficient consistency checks on retrieved information or cross-reference multiple sources to ensure accuracy.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Reliance on Single Source:** The system often appears to rely on a single external source for its answers, making it vulnerable to inaccuracies in that source.\n2.  **No Error Handling for Information Retrieval:** If the initial source is wrong, there is no process to determine if there is a better one or if the information is incorrect.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **lack of a robust information verification process**. The system needs to go beyond simply retrieving information from a source and implement strategies for validating its accuracy, such as cross-referencing multiple sources, applying logical constraints, or using common sense reasoning.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval and Validation:** Improve the accuracy and reliability of information retrieval by implementing validation mechanisms. This involves checking the credibility of sources and cross-referencing data from multiple sources.\n2.  **Reasoning and Consistency Checks:** Incorporate reasoning and consistency checks into the system's decision-making process. This will help identify and correct errors in the retrieved information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Source Approach:** Instead of relying on a single source, query multiple sources and compare the information retrieved.\n2.  **Develop a Source Credibility Ranking:** Assign credibility scores to different sources based on their historical accuracy and reliability. Prioritize information from more credible sources.\n3.  **Implement Data Validation Rules:** Create a set of data validation rules based on common sense reasoning and domain-specific knowledge. Use these rules to filter out obviously incorrect information.\n4.  **Introduce a \"No Answer\" Confidence Threshold:** If after consulting multiple sources, there is still no consensus or the confidence level is below a certain threshold, the system should return a \"No Answer\" response rather than a potentially incorrect answer.\n5. Add intermediate print statements for debugging so that you can understand the exact information being retrieved from the external sources, so the problem can be better understood and addressed.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct apparent visual magnitude.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate the correct numerical answer and defaulted to a placeholder.\n\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Extracted an incorrect year from `onlinelibrary.wiley.com`.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the accuracy of the extracted year.\n\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Extracted an incorrect birthdate from `isuresults.com`.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the accuracy of the extracted birthdate.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System Assessment\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly demonstrate a critical flaw: the system confidently provides incorrect answers. This is exacerbated by the inclusion of source information, which, while intended to improve transparency, actually highlights the system's inability to validate retrieved data.  The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest a structured output format, which is good. However, this structure is useless if the content within is incorrect. The system's over-reliance on potentially unreliable external sources, coupled with a lack of internal validation, results in inaccurate responses. The placeholder response in Sample 0 is preferable to the incorrect answers in Samples 1 and 2. Sample 1 uses an external website while Sample 2 uses a `.htm` format and it could be potentially failing in parsing it because of it's format.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses a basic information retrieval capability, demonstrated by its ability to identify and extract URLs and associated text from external sources. However, its overall capability is severely hampered by its inability to discern accurate information from inaccurate information. The current architecture heavily emphasizes information retrieval but almost completely neglects information validation. This leads to a system that is more likely to spread misinformation than provide correct answers, rendering it practically useless in its current state. The ability to cite sources is positive, but without accuracy, it provides a false sense of reliability.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:** The system can retrieve data from external sources. This is a foundational capability upon which other improvements can be built.\n*   **Structured Output:** The use of \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags indicates a structured approach to generating output, which is beneficial for downstream processing and analysis.\n*   **Source Attribution:** Attempts to attribute answers to sources.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Accuracy:** The system provides demonstrably incorrect answers, which is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Lack of Validation:** There is a near-complete absence of mechanisms to validate the accuracy of retrieved information.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Single Sources:** The system seems to trust a single source without cross-referencing or verifying the information.\n*   **Inability to parse different file types:** The system may fail to parse `.htm` files\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **information validation**. Without accurate information, all other capabilities are rendered irrelevant. The system *must* be able to determine the trustworthiness of sources and the veracity of the information retrieved.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Multi-Source Verification:** Modify the information retrieval process to query at least three independent sources for each fact.  Compare the retrieved information and prioritize data that is consistent across multiple sources.  If there are discrepancies, flag the data as potentially unreliable and attempt to resolve the conflict through further investigation or by deferring to a more authoritative source.\n2.  **Develop a Source Credibility Heuristic:** Create a scoring system to assess the credibility of different sources. Consider factors such as the source's reputation, expertise, and historical accuracy. Prioritize information from sources with higher credibility scores. This can be a simple lookup table initially, and iteratively improved as more data becomes available.\n3.  **Implement Data Validation Rules:**  Develop a set of data validation rules based on common sense reasoning, domain-specific knowledge, and logical constraints. For example, if retrieving a birthdate, ensure it falls within a reasonable range.  If retrieving a numerical value, check for outliers or inconsistencies with other known data.  Use these rules to filter out obviously incorrect information.\n4.  **Introduce a Confidence Threshold for \"No Answer\":** If, after consulting multiple sources and applying data validation rules, the system remains uncertain about the accuracy of a fact, it should return a \"No Answer\" response along with an explanation of why it could not provide a definitive answer.  This is preferable to providing incorrect information.\n5.  **Debug with Intermediate Print Statements:** Add detailed print statements within the information retrieval and validation code. These print statements should output the exact queries being sent to external sources, the raw data being retrieved, the results of any validation checks, and the final answer being generated. This will allow you to trace the system's reasoning process and identify the specific points at which errors are occurring. Include checking file type before running parsing to see if `.htm` file is causing errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **declining**. While the system demonstrates the ability to retrieve and present information, its inability to ensure accuracy renders it detrimental. Without significant improvements in information validation, the system's value will continue to decrease.\n"

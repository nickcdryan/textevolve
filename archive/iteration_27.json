  "approach_summary": "The script employs a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions by first analyzing the question type and keywords, then extracting a relevant passage, generating an initial answer, and finally verifying the answer. It decomposes the problem into distinct steps handled by specialized LLM agents (question analyzer, passage extractor, answer generator, and answer verifier), each defined by specific system instructions. The functions `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer` orchestrate these steps, using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API for each stage, and `main` to define the overall workflow.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: There were many factors that made the Bills underdogs before Week 4- an 0-3 start coming off of a demoralizing loss to the New England Patriots, a starting quarterback in Trent Edwards who was starting his very first NFL game, numerous defensive injuries of starters, and an opponent in the New York Jets that had just gotten its first win over the Miami Dolphins. Things started off well for the Bills as Edwards led the offense down into Jets territory, but a Robert Royal fumble caused by Jonathan Vilma ended a promising drive. The Jets could not get any sort of momentum from the turnover, and were forced to punt. In the second quarter, things heated up as the Bills once again managed to gain several first downs, only to see the Jets force another turnover as a deep ball by Edwards meant for Lee Evans was intercepted by Andre Dyson. Three events late in the first half led to a flurry of big plays- Bills safety Donte Whitner tackled Jets RB Leon Washington inbounds to keep the clock running, quarterback Chad Pennington faked a spike and completed a pass to put the Jets in field goal range with a couple of seconds left, and Jets kicker Mike Nugent clanged the ball off the right upright, leaving the game scoreless at the half. The second half saw the Bills take the lead on a 10-yard run by Marshawn Lynch, his second of the year. It was all set up by Edwards going 4 for 4 on the drive. The Jets tied it at 7 on an inspired drive by Pennington, who found Laveranues Coles in the end zone for a touchdown. The fourth quarter saw the Bills take advantage of the Jets when reserve defensive back Jabari Greer intercepted Pennington. The Bills cashed in as Edwards found reserve tight end Michael Gaines on a bootleg 4th down play at the Jets 1-yard line, and once again the Bills got more points when kicker Rian Lindell kicked a 46-yard field goal to make it 17-7. The Jets came right back with points of their own as Leon Washington rambled in to cut the lead to 17-14. After a Buffalo punt with less than 2 minutes remaining, the Jets failed to score as a forced pass by Pennington with 6 seconds left ended up in the acrobatic arms of Terrence McGee, preserving the 17-14 victory. The Bills took over second place in the AFC East at 1-3 because of the win, while the Jets fell to 1-3.\n\nQUESTION: How many wins did the Jets have after this game?",

In 1385, the castle of Ricklingen, where the Mandelslohs resided, was besieged. When a catapult threw a heavy rock at the troops of Duke Albert, he was hit, and died on 28 June 1385. In the wake of his death, Elector Wenceslas appointed Bernard, his brother-in-law, as co-regent involved him in the government. But his younger brother Henry did not agree with this ruling, and after vain attempts to reach an agreement, the fight flared up again in the spring of 1388. Elector Wenceslas had to assemble an army without the help of Bernard, supported by the town of L\u00fcneburg. From Winsen an der Aller, he wanted to attack Celle, which was held by Henry and his mother. During the preparations, however, Elector Wenceslas fell seriously ill and died shortly thereafter. According to legend, he was poisoned. L\u00fcneburg continued the preparations, formed an alliance with the Bishop of Minden and Count of Schaumburg and set up his own army.

      "question": "PASSAGE: In their first home game in nearly a month, the Patriots faced the Broncos, winners of 16 of the last 19 games between the two teams, on Monday Night Football; earlier that day, the Patriots placed Maroney on injured reserve with a shoulder injury after he had missed two of the team's last three games, and activated offensive lineman Stephen Neal from the physically unable to perform list. After winning the coin toss, the Patriots deferred their pick to the start of the second half; the Broncos elected to receive. On the opening series, Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler injured his finger on the first play, but led the Broncos into Patriots territory, where running back Andre Hall, who replaced injured starter Michael Pittman two plays prior, fumbled at the Patriots' 30-yard line; Patriots defensive lineman Le Kevin Smith's recovery gave the Patriots the ball at their own 32-yard line to begin their first drive. A 29-yard reception by Watson brought the Patriots into the Broncos' red zone, where the drive ended and a 31-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. On the fourth play of the Broncos' ensuing drive, Hall fumbled again; this time, a scramble for the ball pushed it 25 yards in the Patriots' favor to the Broncos' 37-yard line, where Mayo recovered it. A Broncos unnecessary roughness penalty on the play gave the ball to the Patriots at the Broncos' 22-yard line, but after failing to make a first down, a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots' lead to 6-0. An exchange of three punts brought the game into the second quarter, where Morris ran for 34 yards on the second play of a Patriots drive to put them in the Broncos' red zone yet again. Four plays later, on 4th-and-1 from the Broncos' 4-yard line, Morris ran for a 4-yard touchdown that gave the Patriots a 13-0 lead. The Broncos' next drive ended with Meriweather intercepting a deep throw by Cutler, setting up the Patriots' next series at their own 16-yard line. After a sack of Cassel put the Patriots even deeper into their own territory, a facemask penalty on Cassel on third down by Broncos linebacker Jamie Winborn gave the Patriots a new set of downs. Five plays later, on another 4th-and-1, Morris ran for 29 yards to give the Patriots a first down from the Broncos' 13-yard line; he ran for a total of 138 yards on 16 carries. On the next play, Moss caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to extend the Patriots' lead to 20-0. The Broncos' next drive began with backup Patrick Ramsey replacing Cutler at quarterback. On the fourth play, defensive lineman Mike Wright sacked Ramsey and forced a fumble, which undrafted free agent linebacker Gary Guyton caught to give the Patriots the ball at midfield. Cassel suffered his fifth sack on the next play, the final of the first half. The Patriots chose to receive the ball to open the second half. Another undrafted rookie, running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis, elevated from the Patriots' practice squad before the Chargers game, replaced Morris, who left the game with a knee injury. A Patriots punt was followed by a Broncos three-and-out; Welker returned the punt 44 yards to give the Patriots the ball at the Broncos' 28-yard line. After two Green-Ellis carries gained one yard, Cassel used a screen play to throw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Moss to extend the Patriots' lead to 27-0. Three completed passes and an unnecessary roughness penalty on Patriots defensive lineman Vince Wilfork moved the Broncos' next drive into Patriots' territory before the Broncos turned the ball over for the fifth and final time, with safety James Sanders intercepting a Cutler pass; a second unnecessary roughness call, originally on Wilfork but later changed to be on Sanders, gave the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line to begin the ensuing drive. Three plays after a 27-yard Welker catch put the Patriots in Broncos territory, Broncos safety Calvin Lowry appeared to have intercepted an errant Cassel throw at the Broncos' 1-yard line, but, when the Patriots challenged, the pass was deemed incomplete, as the ball touched the ground before Lowry had possession. Two plays later, Welker caught his first touchdown pass of the season, this one from 6 yards out, to give the Patriots a 34-0 lead. Four plays later, former Patriots tight end Daniel Graham caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Cutler to cut the Patriots' lead to 34-7. The Patriots' next drive got as far as the Broncos' 33-yard line but eventually ended in a punt. The Broncos, facing 3rd-and-21 on their next drive, had a 21-yard completion by Cutler pushed back by a Broncos holding penalty; Richard Seymour sacked Cutler on the next play, forcing the Broncos to punt on 4th-and-23 with 6:35 left in the game. On the ensuing Patriots drive, two 10-yard runs by Green-Ellis and 16- and 15-yard runs by Faulk put the Patriots in the red zone, where Green-Ellis earned his first NFL touchdown, running in untouched from the 1-yard line, to score the final points of the game. Another Broncos punt gave the Patriots the ball to end the game with a 41-7 victory that took the Patriots' record to 4-2. The Patriots accumulated 257 rushing yards, their largest total since the 1985 season. Cassel, who completed 18 of 24 passes for 185 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, finished with a passer rating of 136.3, one of the ten highest single-game ratings in Patriots history, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. On the final play of the third quarter, as the Broncos were driving into Patriots territory, Harrison was injured while attempting to tackle Cutler. Harrison, whose 2005 and 2006 seasons were cut short by knee injuries that caused ligament damage, suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in his right leg. Harrison was carted off the field and placed on injured reserve two days later. Safety Antwain Spann was then activated from the practice squad. The Broncos also lost players to injury: Ramsey and linebacker Boss Bailey were also placed on injured reserve, while cornerback Champ Bailey was sidelined for several weeks by a torn groin muscle.\n\nQUESTION: How many points were scored in the first quarter?",

Another undrafted rookie, running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis, elevated from the Patriots' practice squad before the Chargers game, replaced Morris, who left the game with a knee injury. A Patriots punt was followed by a Broncos three-and-out; Welker returned the punt 44 yards to give the Patriots the ball at the Broncos' 28-yard line. After two Green-Ellis carries gained one yard, Cassel used a screen play to throw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Moss to extend the Patriots' lead to 27-0. Three completed passes and an unnecessary roughness penalty on Patriots defensive lineman Vince Wilfork moved the Broncos' next drive into Patriots' territory before the Broncos turned the ball over for the fifth and final time, with safety James Sanders intercepting a Cutler pass; a second unnecessary roughness call, originally on Wilfork but later changed to be on Sanders, gave the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line to begin the ensuing drive. Three plays after a 27-yard Welker catch put the Patriots in Broncos territory, Broncos safety Calvin Lowry appeared to have intercepted an errant Cassel throw at the Broncos' 1-yard line, but, when the Patriots challenged, the pass was deemed incomplete, as the ball touched the ground before Lowry had possession. Two plays later, Welker caught his first touchdown pass of the season, this one from 6 yards out, to give the Patriots a 34-0 lead. Four plays later, former Patriots tight end Daniel Graham caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Cutler to cut the Patriots' lead to 34-7. The Patriots' next drive got as far as the Broncos' 33-yard line but eventually ended in a punt. The Broncos, facing 3rd-and-21 on their next drive, had a 21-yard completion by Cutler pushed back by a Broncos holding penalty; Richard Seymour sacked Cutler on the next play, forcing the Broncos to punt on 4th-and-23 with 6:35 left in the game. On the ensuing Patriots drive, two 10-yard runs by Green-Ellis and 16- and 15-yard runs by Faulk put the Patriots in the red zone, where Green-Ellis earned his first NFL touchdown, running in untouched from the 1-yard line, to score the final points of the game. Another Broncos punt gave the Patriots the ball to end the game with a 41-7 victory that took the Patriots' record to 4-2. The Patriots accumulated 257 rushing yards, their largest total since the 1985 season. Cassel, who completed 18 of 24 passes for 185 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, finished with a passer rating of 136.3, one of the ten highest single-game ratings in Patriots history, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. On the final play of the third quarter, as the Broncos were driving into Patriots territory, Harrison was injured while attempting to tackle Cutler. Harrison, whose 2005 and 2006 seasons were cut short by knee injuries that caused ligament damage, suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in his right leg. Harrison was carted off the field and placed on injured reserve two days later. Safety Antwain Spann was then activated from the practice squad. The Broncos also lost players to injury: Ramsey and linebacker Boss Bailey were also placed on injured reserve, while cornerback Champ Bailey was sidelined for several weeks by a torn groin muscle.",

      "original_passage": "There were many factors that made the Bills underdogs before Week 4- an 0-3 start coming off of a demoralizing loss to the New England Patriots, a starting quarterback in Trent Edwards who was starting his very first NFL game, numerous defensive injuries of starters, and an opponent in the New York Jets that had just gotten its first win over the Miami Dolphins. Things started off well for the Bills as Edwards led the offense down into Jets territory, but a Robert Royal fumble caused by Jonathan Vilma ended a promising drive. The Jets could not get any sort of momentum from the turnover, and were forced to punt. In the second quarter, things heated up as the Bills once again managed to gain several first downs, only to see the Jets force another turnover as a deep ball by Edwards meant for Lee Evans was intercepted by Andre Dyson. Three events late in the first half led to a flurry of big plays- Bills safety Donte Whitner tackled Jets RB Leon Washington inbounds to keep the clock running, quarterback Chad Pennington faked a spike and completed a pass to put the Jets in field goal range with a couple of seconds left, and Jets kicker Mike Nugent clanged the ball off the right upright, leaving the game scoreless at the half. The second half saw the Bills take the lead on a 10-yard run by Marshawn Lynch, his second of the year. It was all set up by Edwards going 4 for 4 on the drive. The Jets tied it at 7 on an inspired drive by Pennington, who found Laveranues Coles in the end zone for a touchdown. The fourth quarter saw the Bills take advantage of the Jets when reserve defensive back Jabari Greer intercepted Pennington. The Bills cashed in as Edwards found reserve tight end Michael Gaines on a bootleg 4th down play at the Jets 1-yard line, and once again the Bills got more points when kicker Rian Lindell kicked a 46-yard field goal to make it 17-7. The Jets came right back with points of their own as Leon Washington rambled in to cut the lead to 17-14. After a Buffalo punt with less than 2 minutes remaining, the Jets failed to score as a forced pass by Pennington with 6 seconds left ended up in the acrobatic arms of Terrence McGee, preserving the 17-14 victory. The Bills took over second place in the AFC East at 1-3 because of the win, while the Jets fell to 1-3.",

      "original_passage": "The following year, the feud between the nobility and plundering by robber knights continued. In 1385, the castle of Ricklingen, where the Mandelslohs resided, was besieged. When a catapult threw a heavy rock at the troops of Duke Albert, he was hit, and died on 28 June 1385. In the wake of his death, Elector Wenceslas appointed Bernard, his brother-in-law, as co-regent involved him in the government. But his younger brother Henry did not agree with this ruling, and after vain attempts to reach an agreement, the fight flared up again in the spring of 1388. Elector Wenceslas had to assemble an army without the help of Bernard, supported by the town of L\u00fcneburg. From Winsen an der Aller, he wanted to attack Celle, which was held by Henry and his mother. During the preparations, however, Elector Wenceslas fell seriously ill and died shortly thereafter. According to legend, he was poisoned. L\u00fcneburg continued the preparations, formed an alliance with the Bishop of Minden and Count of Schaumburg and set up his own army. On 28 May 1388, battle was joined at Winsen an der Aller; it ended in victory for Henry. According to the provisions of the Treaty of Hanover from the year 1373, after the death of Wensceslas, the Principality passed to the House of Welf. In 1389, a inheritance agreement between the Welfs and the Ascanians was concluded, the treaty of 1374 was abolished, and the Principality was finally secured for the Welfs.",

      "original_passage": "In their first home game in nearly a month, the Patriots faced the Broncos, winners of 16 of the last 19 games between the two teams, on Monday Night Football; earlier that day, the Patriots placed Maroney on injured reserve with a shoulder injury after he had missed two of the team's last three games, and activated offensive lineman Stephen Neal from the physically unable to perform list. After winning the coin toss, the Patriots deferred their pick to the start of the second half; the Broncos elected to receive. On the opening series, Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler injured his finger on the first play, but led the Broncos into Patriots territory, where running back Andre Hall, who replaced injured starter Michael Pittman two plays prior, fumbled at the Patriots' 30-yard line; Patriots defensive lineman Le Kevin Smith's recovery gave the Patriots the ball at their own 32-yard line to begin their first drive. A 29-yard reception by Watson brought the Patriots into the Broncos' red zone, where the drive ended and a 31-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. On the fourth play of the Broncos' ensuing drive, Hall fumbled again; this time, a scramble for the ball pushed it 25 yards in the Patriots' favor to the Broncos' 37-yard line, where Mayo recovered it. A Broncos unnecessary roughness penalty on the play gave the ball to the Patriots at the Broncos' 22-yard line, but after failing to make a first down, a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots' lead to 6-0. An exchange of three punts brought the game into the second quarter, where Morris ran for 34 yards on the second play of a Patriots drive to put them in the Broncos' red zone yet again. Four plays later, on 4th-and-1 from the Broncos' 4-yard line, Morris ran for a 4-yard touchdown that gave the Patriots a 13-0 lead. The Broncos' next drive ended with Meriweather intercepting a deep throw by Cutler, setting up the Patriots' next series at their own 16-yard line. After a sack of Cassel put the Patriots even deeper into their own territory, a facemask penalty on Cassel on third down by Broncos linebacker Jamie Winborn gave the Patriots a new set of downs. Five plays later, on another 4th-and-1, Morris ran for 29 yards to give the Patriots a first down from the Broncos' 13-yard line; he ran for a total of 138 yards on 16 carries. On the next play, Moss caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to extend the Patriots' lead to 20-0. The Broncos' next drive began with backup Patrick Ramsey replacing Cutler at quarterback. On the fourth play, defensive lineman Mike Wright sacked Ramsey and forced a fumble, which undrafted free agent linebacker Gary Guyton caught to give the Patriots the ball at midfield. Cassel suffered his fifth sack on the next play, the final of the first half. The Patriots chose to receive the ball to open the second half. Another undrafted rookie, running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis, elevated from the Patriots' practice squad before the Chargers game, replaced Morris, who left the game with a knee injury. A Patriots punt was followed by a Broncos three-and-out; Welker returned the punt 44 yards to give the Patriots the ball at the Broncos' 28-yard line. After two Green-Ellis carries gained one yard, Cassel used a screen play to throw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Moss to extend the Patriots' lead to 27-0. Three completed passes and an unnecessary roughness penalty on Patriots defensive lineman Vince Wilfork moved the Broncos' next drive into Patriots' territory before the Broncos turned the ball over for the fifth and final time, with safety James Sanders intercepting a Cutler pass; a second unnecessary roughness call, originally on Wilfork but later changed to be on Sanders, gave the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line to begin the ensuing drive. Three plays after a 27-yard Welker catch put the Patriots in Broncos territory, Broncos safety Calvin Lowry appeared to have intercepted an errant Cassel throw at the Broncos' 1-yard line, but, when the Patriots challenged, the pass was deemed incomplete, as the ball touched the ground before Lowry had possession. Two plays later, Welker caught his first touchdown pass of the season, this one from 6 yards out, to give the Patriots a 34-0 lead. Four plays later, former Patriots tight end Daniel Graham caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Cutler to cut the Patriots' lead to 34-7. The Patriots' next drive got as far as the Broncos' 33-yard line but eventually ended in a punt. The Broncos, facing 3rd-and-21 on their next drive, had a 21-yard completion by Cutler pushed back by a Broncos holding penalty; Richard Seymour sacked Cutler on the next play, forcing the Broncos to punt on 4th-and-23 with 6:35 left in the game. On the ensuing Patriots drive, two 10-yard runs by Green-Ellis and 16- and 15-yard runs by Faulk put the Patriots in the red zone, where Green-Ellis earned his first NFL touchdown, running in untouched from the 1-yard line, to score the final points of the game. Another Broncos punt gave the Patriots the ball to end the game with a 41-7 victory that took the Patriots' record to 4-2. The Patriots accumulated 257 rushing yards, their largest total since the 1985 season. Cassel, who completed 18 of 24 passes for 185 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, finished with a passer rating of 136.3, one of the ten highest single-game ratings in Patriots history, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. On the final play of the third quarter, as the Broncos were driving into Patriots territory, Harrison was injured while attempting to tackle Cutler. Harrison, whose 2005 and 2006 seasons were cut short by knee injuries that caused ligament damage, suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in his right leg. Harrison was carted off the field and placed on injured reserve two days later. Safety Antwain Spann was then activated from the practice squad.

For example, in sample ID 3, it correctly identifies the points scored by each team and the time at which these points were scored to correctly calculate the number of points scored in the first half.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\nSince there are only success cases, identifying weaknesses is not straight-forward. However, some observations can be made:\n\n1.  **Reliance on Exact Matches:** The system may struggle if the answer requires paraphrasing or summarizing information instead of directly extracting it from the text. This cannot be confirmed without seeing the error cases.\n2.  **Potential for Misinterpretation of Context:** Although the system demonstrates contextual understanding in the successful cases, more complex scenarios may be challenging for the current model. Specifically, if the question requires reasoning over multiple sentences, the system might make mistakes.\n3.  **Limited Complex Reasoning:** The successful cases only demonstrate a limited capacity for complex reasoning. Error cases would likely identify limits to reasoning such as comparison, counterfactual, or multi-step inference.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\nWithout error cases, identifying critical bottlenecks is speculative, however these seem most likely:\n\n1.  **Reasoning Complexity:** The primary bottleneck is likely the complexity of reasoning that the system can handle. Successes show that it can perform simple calculations and entity extractions, but it remains unclear how it would handle complex comparison/contrast questions, temporal reasoning, or counterfactuals.\n2.  **Contextual Ambiguity:** Even with the ability to understand simple contexts, the system may get confused if the passages contain ambiguous or contradicting information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nSince only successful samples were provided, there are no error patterns to identify.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nWithout error cases, it is difficult to determine the primary issue. Assuming that the goal is to solve increasingly complex questions, the primary issue is the system's limited ability to perform complex reasoning over the provided text.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Complex Reasoning:** The ability to understand and apply complex reasoning techniques (e.g., comparison, temporal reasoning, causal reasoning) needs significant improvement.\n2.  **Contextual disambiguation:** Improve the ability to determine the correct context when dealing with ambiguous language or contradicting information in the passage.\n3.  **Paraphrasing and Summarization:** Enable the system to paraphrase or summarize relevant information to provide an answer instead of relying on exact matches.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Fine-tune the model on a dataset containing more complex reasoning questions.** This will enable the model to better learn to use complex reasoning techniques.\n2.  **Implement techniques to improve the model's ability to handle ambiguity and contradiction.** This could involve using attention mechanisms to focus on relevant information or incorporating external knowledge sources.\n3.  **Incorporate a paraphrasing module into the system.** This would allow the system to rephrase information in the passage to match the question, even if there is no exact match.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nSince there were no errors, no capabilities failed.

This is good for parsing and automated evaluation. The inclusion of \"Verification:\" within the answer seems like a debugging or confidence-scoring mechanism.\n*   **Numerical Reasoning (Sample 3):** The system successfully extracts numerical values (\"3-point field goal,\" \"3-point field goal\"), performs addition (3 + 3 = 6), and includes the calculation in the output. This is a strong indicator of numerical reasoning ability for simple cases.\n*   **Consistency:** The model appears to be deterministic, which means that given the same input, it produces the same output. This is evident from the consistent structure and content of the answers.\n*   **Potential Redundancy:** The inclusion of \"Verification:\" implies a verification step. Is this necessary in all cases? Could we streamline this by only including it when the confidence score is below a certain threshold, or when there are multiple possible answers?\n*   **Lack of Explanation in Some Cases:** Samples 1 and 2 simply provide a number with the \"Verification:\" tag.  While the number is correct, the system provides no explanation as to *how* it arrived at the answer. This can make it harder to debug issues and understand the system's reasoning process.\n*   **Limited Complexity:** The provided sample outputs only showcase very basic capabilities. While a high accuracy is reported, it's important to acknowledge the limited scope of the test samples.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates strong capabilities in:\n\n*   **Numerical Extraction:**  Accurately identifies numerical values from text.\n*   **Simple Arithmetic:**  Performs basic addition operations.\n*   **Structured Output:** Generates outputs in a predictable and parsable format.\n\nHowever, the system exhibits limitations in:\n\n*   **Explainability:** Lacks explicit reasoning steps for all answers.\n*   **Reasoning Complexity:** Demonstrated capabilities are limited to very basic operations. Its ability to handle more complex logic or multi-step reasoning is unknown.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accuracy in Basic Tasks:**  The system is highly accurate on the tested tasks (simple numerical extraction and addition).\n*   **Structured Output Format:** The clear \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags facilitate integration and evaluation.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Explainability/Transparency:** The limited explanations make it difficult to understand the system's reasoning and identify potential biases or errors.\n*   **Limited Reasoning Depth:** The system's reasoning abilities appear to be shallow. It is unable to perform more complex reasoning tasks.\n*   **Potential Over-reliance on Extraction:** The model seems to rely heavily on direct information extraction, which may limit its ability to handle paraphrased or implied information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Improving Explainability and Reasoning Depth:** The most critical area for improvement is to enhance the system's ability to provide clear explanations for its answers and increase its reasoning capacity to handle more complex scenarios.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Explanation Generation:** Modify the system to include a brief explanation of *how* it arrived at the answer for all cases, not just calculations. For example, in sample 1, the output could be: \"ANSWER_START\\nThe passage states 'Verification: 1'\\nANSWER_END\\n\". This should be done even when the answer is extracted verbatim.\n2.  **Introduce a Confidence Score Threshold for Explanation Inclusion:** Include more detailed reasoning only when the confidence score is below a certain threshold. This would reduce the verbosity of outputs for simple, high-confidence cases while still providing necessary context for more complex or uncertain situations.\n3.  **Expand Training Data with Complex Reasoning Examples:**  Significantly increase the training dataset to include examples that require multi-step reasoning, comparisons, and inference.\n4.  **Incorporate External Knowledge and Common Sense Reasoning:** Explore incorporating external knowledge bases or common sense reasoning modules to enhance the system's ability to handle implicit information and make inferences.\n5.  **Implement a Traceability Mechanism:**  Design the system to be able to trace the steps it takes to arrive at a given answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to determine a clear capability trend. We can say the system is *stable* in its current capabilities, but without a baseline or historical performance data on more complex tasks, we cannot assess whether capabilities are improving or declining. Further testing on a diverse dataset is needed to establish a reliable trend.\n",

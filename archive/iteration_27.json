Ensembling: Applies multiple transformations, and dynamically combining them to create a final hybrid result.\n2.  Dynamic Weighting: Use the LLM to assess and balance the contribution of each transformation technique.\n3. Focus on Local vs Global Strategies: This approach uses and weighs both local and global transformation strategies.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union\n\ndef call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):\n    \"\"\"Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        from google import genai\n        from google.genai import types\n\n        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"))\n\n        if system_instruction:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n                    system_instruction=system_instruction\n                ),\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n        else:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n\n        return response.text\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}\")\n        return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n\ndef extract_grids(question: str) -> Dict:\n    \"\"\"Extracts the training and test grids from the question.\"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are an expert at extracting information from grid transformation problems.\n    Given the following question, extract all training input grids, training output grids, and the test input grid.\n\n    Example:\n    question: === TRAINING EXAMPLES === Example 1: Input Grid: [[1, 2], [3, 4]] Output Grid: [[4, 3], [2, 1]] === TEST INPUT === [[5, 6], [7, 8]] Transform the test input.\n    Extracted Grids: {{\"train_input\": [[[1, 2], [3, 4]]], \"train_output\": [[[4, 3], [2, 1]]], \"test_input\": [[[5, 6], [7, 8]]]}}\n\n\tquestion: === TRAINING EXAMPLES === Example 1: Input Grid: [[0, 0], [0, 4]] Output Grid: [[4, 4], [4, 4]] === TEST INPUT === [[0, 0], [0, 0]] Transform the test input.\n    Extracted Grids: {{\"train_input\": [[[0, 0], [0, 4]]], \"train_output\": [[[4, 4], [4, 4]]], \"test_input\": [[[0, 0], [0, 0]]]}}\n\n    question: {question}\n    Extracted Grids:\n    \"\"\"\n    extracted_grids_str = call_llm(prompt)\n    try:\n        extracted_grids = eval(extracted_grids_str)\n        return extracted_grids\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing extracted grids: {e}\")\n        return {\"train_input\": [], \"train_output\": [], \"test_input\": []}\n\ndef apply_global_transformation(train_input: List, train_output: List, test_input: List) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Applies global transformations such as shifting or rotation to the test input.\"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"You are an expert in global grid transformations.\n    Given the training examples (input and output grids) and the test input grid, identify and apply a global transformation (e.g., shifting, rotation, mirroring) to the test input.\n\n    Example:\n    train_input: [[[1, 2], [3, 4]]]\n    train_output: [[[2, 1], [4, 3]]]\n    test_input: [[[5, 6], [7, 8]]]\n    Global Transformation: The columns are swapped.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses an ensemble approach to grid transformation by combining global and local transformation techniques, with dynamic weighting determined by the LLM. The problem is decomposed into extracting grids, applying global and local transformations using separate LLM calls, determining weights for each transformation, and finally combining them. The script employs an ensemble of LLM-driven agents, including roles such as grid extractor, global transformer, local transformer, weight determiner, and transformation combiner. The functions used are `extract_grids` (extracts grids from the question), `apply_global_transformation` (applies global transformations), `apply_local_transformation` (applies local transformations), `determine_weights` (determines weights for combining transformations), and `combine_transformations` (combines transformations based on weights); `main` orchestrates the calls to the above functions to generate the final transformation. The overall workflow involves extracting relevant grids, applying both global and local transformations, dynamically weighting the transformations, and combining them to produce a final transformed grid.",

This is likely due to improper formatting or an inability to handle the grid's structure correctly.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the lack of successful cases, it is difficult to determine the system's strengths. However, the system attempts to address the prompt, demonstrating some ability in:\n\n1.  **Problem Recognition:** The system recognizes the task as a grid transformation problem.\n2.  **Attempted Information Extraction:** The system attempts to extract grid information from the input.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Grid Parsing/Interpretation:** The most significant weakness is the system's inability to correctly parse and interpret grid data, as evidenced by the recurring \"Error parsing extracted grids: invalid syntax\" error.\n2.  **Pattern Recognition and Application:** The system fails to identify and apply the grid transformation pattern from the training examples to the test input. This could be due to problems with feature extraction, similarity detection, or generalisation.\n3. **Robustness**: The system does not handle input errors gracefully and fails to continue the computation.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Grid Data Parsing:** The inability to correctly parse the input grids is the primary bottleneck, preventing the system from performing any meaningful analysis or transformation.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent Parsing Failure:** The \"Error parsing extracted grids: invalid syntax\" error occurs across all error cases, indicating a systematic problem with the grid data extraction and parsing mechanism.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **failure to correctly parse the input grids**, which is causing a cascading failure that prevents any downstream processing from occurring.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Robust Grid Parsing:** The system needs a more robust and reliable method for extracting and parsing grid data. This might involve stricter input validation, error handling, or using a dedicated library for handling grid structures.\n2.  **Pattern Extraction from examples**: The system needs to be able to extract patterns from the examples, so that it can be applied in the test grid.\n3.  **Generalization capabilities**: The system needs to be able to take the general pattern it extracts and correctly apply it to the test grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a dedicated grid parsing module:** Develop a separate module specifically responsible for parsing grid data from text. This module should include error handling and validation to ensure the data is in the correct format.\n2.  **Add input validation and sanitization:** Before parsing, validate the input string to check for common errors, such as incorrect brackets or missing delimiters. Sanitize the input by removing any extraneous characters that might interfere with parsing.\n3.  **Implement a debugging process**: Add logging statements that show what the system is doing as it proceeds to solve the problem. If it fails, these print statements can be referenced.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed (Could not extract grids correctly).\n    *   constraint\\_handling: N/A (Parsing failed, so constraints weren't considered).\n    *   solution\\_generation: N/A\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: N/A\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed (Could not extract grids correctly).\n    *   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n    *   solution\\_generation: N/A\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: N/A\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed (Could not extract grids correctly).\n    *   constraint\\_handling: N/A\n    *   solution\\_generation: N/A\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: N/A\n",

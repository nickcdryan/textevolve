  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings using an LLM-driven approach with specialized agents and multi-stage verification. It decomposes the problem into information extraction and meeting scheduling, using `extract_meeting_info` and `schedule_meeting` functions, respectively. The `extract_meeting_info` function extracts details, and the `schedule_meeting` function proposes a meeting time, with both functions including verification steps to ensure accuracy. The functions `main`, `extract_meeting_info`, `schedule_meeting`, and `call_llm` work together where `main` orchestrates the process, `extract_meeting_info` extracts data, `schedule_meeting` sets the time, and `call_llm` communicates with the LLM. The overall workflow involves extracting meeting details, scheduling the meeting, and validating the extracted information and proposed meeting times.",

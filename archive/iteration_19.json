  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with LLMs to transform input grids based on patterns observed in training examples. It decomposes the problem into three stages: rule extraction, rule refinement, and rule application, each handled by a dedicated function that acts as an agent with a specific role. The main functions used include `rule_extraction` which extracts the transformation rule, `refine_rule` which refines the extracted rule for accuracy, `apply_rule` which applies the refined rule to the input grid, `call_llm` which is used to call the Gemini LLM, and `main` which orchestrates the entire process. The overall workflow involves extracting a rule from examples, refining it, and then applying it to a test input grid to generate the transformed output.",

The system can generally understand the structure of the input and output grids.\n2.  The system correctly identifies that the task involves transforming the input grid based on patterns learned from training examples.\n3.  The system can output a grid in the correct format.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  The system struggles to identify and apply the precise pattern in the training examples. It seems to be able to recognize the general structure, but fails to identify the specific transformations applied.\n2.  The system sometimes produces output grids that are structurally similar but contain different values than the golden answer.\n3.  The system doesn't consistently replace values in the test grid according to the pattern shown in the training examples.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Pattern Recognition and Application:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to accurately recognize and apply the complex patterns demonstrated in the training examples. This includes identifying which values to change and where in the grid these changes should occur. This is especially noticeable when changes involve numbers beyond simple repetition or mirroring.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Value Substitution Errors:** The system often makes mistakes in substituting values in the output grid. This suggests the pattern recognition module fails to correctly link input values with the corresponding output values within the specific context of row and column positions. This issue is prominent in cases where the transformation goes beyond simple mirroring or repetition.\n2.  **Structural Similarity, Numerical Discrepancy:** The AI generates outputs structurally resembling correct solutions, indicating basic grid format recognition. However, numerical differences reveal an inability to accurately apply learned transformation rules. This suggests the AI struggles to grasp complex relationships between input and output values within grid structures.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the system's flawed pattern recognition and application logic. The AI struggles to internalize the mapping between input and output grids, specifically how values change and are positioned based on the provided training examples. The system fails to understand complex relational mappings that drive the transformation and results in inaccurate substitutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the pattern recognition module to better identify and understand the complex relationships between input and output grids. This should include the ability to recognize value changes and positional dependencies within the grid structure.\n2.  **Value Mapping:** Strengthen the value mapping mechanism, ensuring it can accurately link input values with the corresponding output values based on identified patterns.\n3.  **Constraint Handling:** Enhance constraint handling to ensure the generated output adheres to the rules of transformation learned from the examples.\n4.  **Abstraction and Generalization:** The AI needs to be able to abstract general rules from the specific examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Enhanced Pattern Recognition Training:** Incorporate more training examples that demonstrate a wider variety of transformation patterns, including complex value substitutions and positional dependencies.\n2.  **Attention Mechanism:** Implement an attention mechanism that allows the system to focus on the specific areas of the input grid that are most relevant to the transformation. This could help the system identify the critical features of the pattern and how they relate to the output.\n3.  **Intermediate Representation:** Introduce an intermediate representation that explicitly captures the learned pattern. This representation should include information about value changes, positional dependencies, and any other relevant transformation rules. This can act as debuggable output that makes it easier to determine what rule has been identified.\n4.  **Symbolic Reasoning Integration:** Consider integrating symbolic reasoning techniques to enhance the system's ability to understand and apply logical rules derived from the training examples.\n5.  **Increased Debugging capabilities**: Adding additional debugging information such as print statements and intermediate outputs will make it easier to debug the specific rule that is leading to a wrong answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n**Sample ID: 0**\n*   pattern_recognition: Failed\n*   solution_generation: Failed\n*   solution_verification: Failed\n\n**Sample ID: 1**\n*   pattern_recognition: Failed\n*   solution_generation: Failed\n*   solution_verification: Failed\n\n**Sample ID: 2**\n*   pattern_recognition: Failed\n*   solution_generation: Failed\n*   solution_verification: Failed\n",

This should include the ability to recognize value changes and positional dependencies within the grid structure.\n2.  **Value Mapping:** Strengthen the value mapping mechanism, ensuring it can accurately link input values with the corresponding output values based on identified patterns.\n3.  **Constraint Handling:** Enhance constraint handling to ensure the generated output adheres to the rules of transformation learned from the examples.\n4.  **Abstraction and Generalization:** The AI needs to be able to abstract general rules from the specific examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Enhanced Pattern Recognition Training:** Incorporate more training examples that demonstrate a wider variety of transformation patterns, including complex value substitutions and positional dependencies.\n2.  **Attention Mechanism:** Implement an attention mechanism that allows the system to focus on the specific areas of the input grid that are most relevant to the transformation. This could help the system identify the critical features of the pattern and how they relate to the output.\n3.  **Intermediate Representation:** Introduce an intermediate representation that explicitly captures the learned pattern. This representation should include information about value changes, positional dependencies, and any other relevant transformation rules. This can act as debuggable output that makes it easier to determine what rule has been identified.\n4.  **Symbolic Reasoning Integration:** Consider integrating symbolic reasoning techniques to enhance the system's ability to understand and apply logical rules derived from the training examples.\n5.  **Increased Debugging capabilities**: Adding additional debugging information such as print statements and intermediate outputs will make it easier to debug the specific rule that is leading to a wrong answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n**Sample ID: 0**\n*   pattern_recognition: Failed\n*   solution_generation: Failed\n*   solution_verification: Failed\n\n**Sample ID: 1**\n*   pattern_recognition: Failed\n*   solution_generation: Failed\n*   solution_verification: Failed\n\n**Sample ID: 2**\n*   pattern_recognition: Failed\n*   solution_generation: Failed\n*   solution_verification: Failed\n\n## SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS ANALYSIS\n*   **Sample 0:** The system produces a grid with only the values 4 and 9. This indicates the system is detecting *some* elements of the pattern (perhaps the allowed values), but is failing to place them correctly. The grid's homogeneity suggests a failure to differentiate between different regions or apply positional transformations.\n*   **Sample 1:** The output is a grid mostly filled with zeros, with a scattering of 7s and 4s in a limited area. This suggests a potentially oversimplified or incorrect pattern recognition that struggles with the full complexity of the example. There are hints of positional awareness (the non-zero values are grouped), but the values and their placements are wrong.\n*   **Sample 2:** This output has much more complexity than the others, including a wider range of values. The presence of the values 5 and 8 are there but seemingly placed arbitrarily and not in the correct locations. There are signs of positional awareness, but the substitutions and placement are completely wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\nThe system currently demonstrates *very* limited capability in solving these tasks. While it understands the basic grid structure, it fails entirely at pattern recognition and accurate value substitution. Its outputs show glimpses of understanding specific aspects of the grid, but it can't combine them to generate a correct solution. Its ability to generalize to unseen grids based on examples is virtually non-existent.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n*   **Grid Structure Understanding:** The system understands the basic format and structure of grid-based inputs and outputs. This provides a foundation for more sophisticated logic.\n*   **Task Identification:** The system recognizes that the problem involves pattern-based transformations.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to accurately recognize and abstract complex patterns from the training examples.\n*   **Value Mapping:** It fails to accurately map input values to output values based on identified patterns.\n*   **Generalization:** The system shows almost no ability to generalize from the training examples to new, unseen grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition**. Without accurate pattern recognition, value mapping and output generation will inevitably fail.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n1.  **Focus on Intermediate Representation:** Implement and refine an intermediate representation that explicitly captures the learned pattern. Critically, add debug logging that will show this representation to the engineering team for error diagnosis. This is more important than accuracy in the short-term; it will enable debuggability.\n2.  **Implement a basic attention mechanism:** Start with a very simple attention mechanism that focuses on individual rows/columns in the training example. Train the system to identify the \"active\" rows/columns that dictate the output.\n3.  **Simplify training data:** Create a smaller training set with extremely simple transformations (e.g., inverting colors, simple rotations). If the system can't master these basic tasks, it won't be able to handle more complex patterns.\n4. **Logging:** Add more print statements and logging throughout the execution of the program that make it easy to understand what rule the system is evaluating and why it is coming to a conclusion\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. No progress is being made towards solving the tasks. Improvement will require significant architectural changes and focused training efforts.\n",

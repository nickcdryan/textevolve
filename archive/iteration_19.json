  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions by analyzing the question, extracting a relevant passage, generating an initial answer, and then verifying it. It decomposes the problem into question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification, assigning an \"expert\" role to the LLM in each stage with chain-of-thought prompting. The functions `analyze_question` extracts question type and keywords, `extract_relevant_passage` finds the passage containing the answer, `generate_answer` creates an answer and `verify_answer` confirms the answer using the passage; each of these functions calls `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves sequentially calling these functions, passing the output of one as input to the next, to refine and verify the final answer.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Chargers scored took a 10-0 lead, with quarterback Philip Rivers connecting on a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Hunter Henry, followed in the second quarter by a 37-yard field goal by placekicker Josh Lambo. Chargers' return specialist Travis Benjamin fumbled a punt return at the Chargers' 11-yard line, however, the Broncos did not gain any yardage, and were forced to settle for a 29-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. Three third-quarter field goals by Lambo&#8212;from 21, 31 and 32 yards out&#8212;added to the Chargers' lead. The middle score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Jordan Taylor. McManus missed wide-right on a 56-yard field goal at the end of the third quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, the Broncos' defense forced a Chargers' punt that backed up the Broncos to their own 3-yard line. On the next play from scrimmage, Broncos' offensive tackle Russell Okung was penalized for holding in the end zone that resulted in a safety, extending the Chargers' lead to 21-3. On the ensuing free kick, the Chargers committed another special teams turnover, with guard Kenny Wiggins fumbling the kick near midfield. The Broncos capitalized on this turnover, with a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Trevor Siemian to wide receiver Bennie Fowler. The Broncos' defense forced a three-and-out on the Chargers' next possession with six minutes remaining in the game. On the sixth play of the Broncos' next drive, Siemian connected with running back C. J. Anderson on a 20-yard touchdown, however, another costly holding penalty on Okung negated the scoring play. Two plays later, Siemian connected on a pass completion to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas to the Chargers' 13-yard line, however, Chargers' linebacker Jatavis Brown forced a fumble off Thomas, which was recovered by cornerback Craig Mager, ending the drive with 3:35 remaining. The Broncos' defense forced another three-and-out, but used all three of their team timeouts in the process. A 46-yard field goal by McManus with 32 seconds remaining pulled the Broncos to within a 21-13 deficit. The Broncos recovered the onside kick at their own 46-yard line, however, four plays later, a desperation hail mary pass by Siemian fell short of the end zone. Special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis served as interim head coach, while Gary Kubiak recovered from a migraine condition that he suffered during the previous week. As part of the NFL Color Rush program, the Broncos wore all-orange throwback uniforms. With the loss, the Broncos' NFL-record 15-game road winning streak against division opponents came to an end. This was the Broncos' final game in San Diego, as the Chargers relocated to Los Angeles after the 2016 season.\n\nQUESTION: Where did the Chargers away move from?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Hoping to rebound from their devastating Sunday Night loss to the Cardinals, the Vikings went home and met the Cincinnati Bengals in a Week 14 duel. After a scoreless first quarter, Minnesota took first blood as kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 41-yard field goal. They increased their lead later in the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 9-yard TD pass. Cincinnati responded with quarterback Carson Palmer finding wide receiver Chad Ochocinco on a 15-yard TD pass, however the Vikings quickly scored two field goals by kicker Ryan Longwell (from 23 and 44 yards out) to put the Vikings up 16-7 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Vikings scored the period's only points as running back Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally with kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 22-yard field goal, but the Vikings put the game away with running back Adrian Peterson's 3-yard TD run. With the win, the Vikings not only improved to 11-2 on the season, they also secured a playoff berth for the second consecutive season and improved upon the record from the previous season (10-6).

In May 1275, the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned; that the Burmese evidently had no intention of submitting; and that war was the only way forward. But the emperor rejected an outright invasion. Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign, the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair. He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song; the emperor ordered the Yunnan provincial army to secure the borderlands in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees. He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover. As planned, the Yunnan army proceeded to consolidate the borderlands in 1275-76. Elsewhere, the main Mongol armies had captured most of the Song territory by 1276. By 1277, at least one Burmese vassal state named \"Gold Teeth\"  had submitted to the Mongols.

Chargers' return specialist Travis Benjamin fumbled a punt return at the Chargers' 11-yard line, however, the Broncos did not gain any yardage, and were forced to settle for a 29-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. Three third-quarter field goals by Lambo&#8212;from 21, 31 and 32 yards out&#8212;added to the Chargers' lead. The middle score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Jordan Taylor. McManus missed wide-right on a 56-yard field goal at the end of the third quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, the Broncos' defense forced a Chargers' punt that backed up the Broncos to their own 3-yard line. On the next play from scrimmage, Broncos' offensive tackle Russell Okung was penalized for holding in the end zone that resulted in a safety, extending the Chargers' lead to 21-3. On the ensuing free kick, the Chargers committed another special teams turnover, with guard Kenny Wiggins fumbling the kick near midfield. The Broncos capitalized on this turnover, with a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Trevor Siemian to wide receiver Bennie Fowler. The Broncos' defense forced a three-and-out on the Chargers' next possession with six minutes remaining in the game. On the sixth play of the Broncos' next drive, Siemian connected with running back C. J. Anderson on a 20-yard touchdown, however, another costly holding penalty on Okung negated the scoring play. Two plays later, Siemian connected on a pass completion to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas to the Chargers' 13-yard line, however, Chargers' linebacker Jatavis Brown forced a fumble off Thomas, which was recovered by cornerback Craig Mager, ending the drive with 3:35 remaining. The Broncos' defense forced another three-and-out, but used all three of their team timeouts in the process. A 46-yard field goal by McManus with 32 seconds remaining pulled the Broncos to within a 21-13 deficit. The Broncos recovered the onside kick at their own 46-yard line, however, four plays later, a desperation hail mary pass by Siemian fell short of the end zone. Special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis served as interim head coach, while Gary Kubiak recovered from a migraine condition that he suffered during the previous week. As part of the NFL Color Rush program, the Broncos wore all-orange throwback uniforms. With the loss, the Broncos' NFL-record 15-game road winning streak against division opponents came to an end.

Though it was ultimately under Mongol command, many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were Turkic-speaking peoples or people from the further west: Turks from Samarkand, Bukhara, Merv and Nishapur, but also captive soldiers from the Persian Khwarazmid empire, the Kipchaks, and even Bulgars from the lower Volga.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and other information.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs show the system can extract textual spans from the input passage and enclose them within \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags. This demonstrates a basic capability for information extraction and output formatting. However, the success of this extraction depends heavily on the question type and the complexity of the required reasoning. The provided outputs correspond to the success cases and therefore don't highlight the errors outlined in the error analysis report. To get a full picture, it is necessary to also look at the failed cases.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates the following capabilities:\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system can successfully extract specific pieces of information explicitly mentioned in the provided text.\n*   **Entity Recognition:** The system can identify entities or named objects within the text.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system can format the extracted information by wrapping it in predefined tags.\n\nHowever, the system is severely limited by the following:\n\n*   **Lack of Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system cannot perform basic arithmetic calculations.\n*   **Limited Inference Abilities:** The system struggles with questions that require any form of inference or logical deduction beyond direct extraction.\n*   **Question Understanding Deficiencies:** The system sometimes fails to understand the precise intent of the question.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Direct Information Extraction:** Accurate at extracting explicitly stated information.\n*   **Entity Recognition:** Ability to identify and extract named entities from text.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning:** Completely unable to perform calculations.\n*   **Inference and Reasoning:** Limited to direct extraction, no inference abilities.\n*   **Question Understanding:** Frequent misinterpretations of the question's intent.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Arithmetic Reasoning**. While question understanding and inference are crucial in the long run, the system's complete inability to perform even basic arithmetic creates a fundamental bottleneck. Addressing this immediately will unlock a significant portion of question types and improve overall usefulness.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nImplement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Integrate a Calculator Module:**\n    *   **Functionality:** This module should accept two numerical values and an operator (+, -, \\*, /) as input and return the calculated result.\n    *   **Integration:** Modify the system to identify numerical values within extracted text and use the question to determine the appropriate operator. Pass these to the Calculator Module.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Include error handling for cases where the extracted text does not contain valid numerical values or when an invalid operation is requested. Return a default value or error message in such cases.  For example, if division by zero occurs, return \"undefined\" or a similar placeholder.\n\n2.  **Implement a Simple Rule for Subtraction:**\n    *   **Rule:** If the question contains words like \"difference,\" \"less than,\" or \"how many more,\" assume a subtraction operation is needed.\n    *   **Implementation:** After extracting relevant numerical values, apply this rule to trigger the Calculator Module with the appropriate operands and the subtraction operator.\n\n3.  **Logging and Debugging:** Add more detailed print statements that show the extracted numerical values, identified operator, module output, and final answer. This will help track the system\u2019s reasoning steps and identify failure points during development.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities appear **stable with limitations**. The system excels at direct extraction but lacks more complex reasoning abilities. The suggested improvements aim to initiate an **improving trend**, specifically in arithmetic reasoning, which will have a cascading effect on other related areas.\n",

This may involve techniques such as question classification or query parsing.\n*   **Inference Reasoning:** Introduce a basic inference mechanism that can draw simple conclusions based on the extracted information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n*   **Implement a Calculator Module:** Integrate a dedicated module to handle arithmetic calculations. This module should be able to identify numerical values in the extracted information and perform the required operations.\n*   **Develop Question Classification:** Train a question classification model to categorize questions based on the type of answer expected (e.g., numerical, entity, date, description).\n*   **Introduce Simple Rule-Based Inference:** Implement a set of simple rules to infer new facts from the extracted information. For example, if the question asks for a difference, the system should identify the relevant numerical values and subtract them.\n*   **Add Print Statements:** Add print statements during execution to show what the system is doing at different steps, and add the current values of the relevant variables that will allow debugging later.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 4:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making failed due to inability to perform arithmetic (subtraction).\n*   **Sample 6:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making failed due to inability to perform arithmetic (addition).\n*   **Sample 9:** solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making failed due to misinterpreting the question type.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and other information.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs show the system can extract textual spans from the input passage and enclose them within \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags. This demonstrates a basic capability for information extraction and output formatting. However, the success of this extraction depends heavily on the question type and the complexity of the required reasoning. The provided outputs correspond to the success cases and therefore don't highlight the errors outlined in the error analysis report. To get a full picture, it is necessary to also look at the failed cases.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates the following capabilities:\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system can successfully extract specific pieces of information explicitly mentioned in the provided text.\n*   **Entity Recognition:** The system can identify entities or named objects within the text.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system can format the extracted information by wrapping it in predefined tags.\n\nHowever, the system is severely limited by the following:\n\n*   **Lack of Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system cannot perform basic arithmetic calculations.\n*   **Limited Inference Abilities:** The system struggles with questions that require any form of inference or logical deduction beyond direct extraction.\n*   **Question Understanding Deficiencies:** The system sometimes fails to understand the precise intent of the question.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Direct Information Extraction:** Accurate at extracting explicitly stated information.\n*   **Entity Recognition:** Ability to identify and extract named entities from text.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning:** Completely unable to perform calculations.\n*   **Inference and Reasoning:** Limited to direct extraction, no inference abilities.\n*   **Question Understanding:** Frequent misinterpretations of the question's intent.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Arithmetic Reasoning**. While question understanding and inference are crucial in the long run, the system's complete inability to perform even basic arithmetic creates a fundamental bottleneck. Addressing this immediately will unlock a significant portion of question types and improve overall usefulness.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nImplement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Integrate a Calculator Module:**\n    *   **Functionality:** This module should accept two numerical values and an operator (+, -, \\*, /) as input and return the calculated result.\n    *   **Integration:** Modify the system to identify numerical values within extracted text and use the question to determine the appropriate operator. Pass these to the Calculator Module.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Include error handling for cases where the extracted text does not contain valid numerical values or when an invalid operation is requested. Return a default value or error message in such cases.  For example, if division by zero occurs, return \"undefined\" or a similar placeholder.\n\n2.  **Implement a Simple Rule for Subtraction:**\n    *   **Rule:** If the question contains words like \"difference,\" \"less than,\" or \"how many more,\" assume a subtraction operation is needed.\n    *   **Implementation:** After extracting relevant numerical values, apply this rule to trigger the Calculator Module with the appropriate operands and the subtraction operator.\n\n3.  **Logging and Debugging:** Add more detailed print statements that show the extracted numerical values, identified operator, module output, and final answer. This will help track the system\u2019s reasoning steps and identify failure points during development.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities appear **stable with limitations**. The system excels at direct extraction but lacks more complex reasoning abilities. The suggested improvements aim to initiate an **improving trend**, specifically in arithmetic reasoning, which will have a cascading effect on other related areas.\n"

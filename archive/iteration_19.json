      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**System Version:** (Assume this is v1.0, since no version is specified) v1.0\n\n**Performance Summary:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently demonstrate a failure to generate correct output grids based on input grids and training examples.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The generated grid of `[[0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]` bears no obvious relationship to the expected transformation based on training examples. The presence of values like '1' and '2' seem arbitrary. There is no clear pattern emerging from this output.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The generated grid consists largely of zeroes with a small 3x3 block containing '2' values. This indicates the system might be able to isolate a subsection of the grid, but the values and their arrangement are incorrect. The concentration of zeros also suggests a possible bias or a tendency towards a default output.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** This sample shows a greater variety of numbers (2, 3, 7) than the other samples, but the layout of these values is still seemingly random and unrelated to the expected transformed grid. Again, this suggests a difficulty in translating input features to output features in a predictable way.\n\nNo runtime errors were explicitly present in the output. The errors are purely logical, reflecting a breakdown in the AI's reasoning about the task at hand. The system is generating *something*, but it's fundamentally incorrect. The structure of the output as a matrix is correct, suggesting basic output formatting is functional.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates very limited capabilities in solving the grid transformation task. While it can process input and generate output in the correct format (a grid), its core ability to learn and apply transformation rules is completely absent. It is not able to effectively use training data to extrapolate to the unseen input. The system shows a clear weakness in pattern recognition and generalization.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Input Processing:** Able to successfully parse and process input grid data.\n*   **Output Generation:** Able to consistently generate a grid as output in the correct format.\n*   **Information Extraction**: Able to extract information from the input examples to create the grid output.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** Fails to recognize and generalize complex patterns present in the training examples.\n*   **Rule Extraction:** Unable to extract abstract, high-level transformation rules from the grid examples.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Fails to adhere to implicit constraints on output values as dictated by the transformation pattern.\n*   **Solution Generation:** Generates incorrect solutions.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Since the solutions are incorrect, the system doesn't have an effective solution verification process.\n*   **Decision Making:** The system's decision making ability fails as it is not generating correct output grids based on the input grids and training examples.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization.** Without the ability to identify patterns and generalize them to unseen inputs, the system is fundamentally unable to solve the problem.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nImplement the following changes in the next iteration, prioritizing those most likely to impact pattern recognition and generalization:\n\n1.  **Implement Enhanced Feature Engineering:** Focus on features designed to highlight relationships between input and output grids. Specifically calculate difference grids (output - input) to see what values are added and subtracted. Track the locations of these changes relative to other grid features.\n2.  **Integrate Print Statements for Debugging:** Add detailed print statements, especially in the transformation logic (where the grid is modified), to log intermediate values and decisions. This will be crucial for debugging future failures.\n3.  **Modular Reasoning Implementation:** The suggestion of breaking down the transformation process into smaller, more manageable steps should be investigated and implemented. This will allow the system to solve the individual transformation steps first and then transform the grid in sequence.\n4.  **Augmented Training Data:** This is a future goal, but not something that can be changed for the *next* iteration since the report only includes three examples.\n5.  **Attention Mechanisms:** This is a more advanced technique that can be considered later if simpler strategies don't significantly improve performance.\n6.  **Symbolic Reasoning:** This is a more advanced technique that can be considered later if simpler strategies don't significantly improve performance.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0% accuracy), the capabilities are currently **stable** at a very low level. Without significant architectural or algorithmic changes, no improvement is expected. The next iteration will need to show significant improvement to establish an upward trend.\n",

    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**System Version:** (Assume this is v1.0, since no version is specified) v1.0\n\n**Performance Summary:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently demonstrate a failure to generate correct output grids based on input grids and training examples.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The generated grid of `[[0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]` bears no obvious relationship to the expected transformation based on training examples. The presence of values like '1' and '2' seem arbitrary. There is no clear pattern emerging from this output.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The generated grid consists largely of zeroes with a small 3x3 block containing '2' values. This indicates the system might be able to isolate a subsection of the grid, but the values and their arrangement are incorrect. The concentration of zeros also suggests a possible bias or a tendency towards a default output.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** This sample shows a greater variety of numbers (2, 3, 7) than the other samples, but the layout of these values is still seemingly random and unrelated to the expected transformed grid. Again, this suggests a difficulty in translating input features to output features in a predictable way.\n\nNo runtime errors were explicitly present in the output. The errors are purely logical, reflecting a breakdown in the AI's reasoning about the task at hand. The system is generating *something*, but it's fundamentally incorrect. The structure of the output as a matrix is correct, suggesting basic output formatting is functional.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates very limited capabilities in solving the grid transformation task. While it can process input and generate output in the correct format (a grid), its core ability to learn and apply transformation rules is completely absent. It is not able to effectively use training data to extrapolate to the unseen input. The system shows a clear weakness in pattern recognition and generalization.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Input Processing:** Able to successfully parse and process input grid data.\n*   **Output Generation:** Able to consistently generate a grid as output in the correct format.\n*   **Information Extraction**: Able to extract information from the input examples to create the grid output.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** Fails to recognize and generalize complex patterns present in the training examples.\n*   **Rule Extraction:** Unable to extract abstract, high-level transformation rules from the grid examples.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Fails to adhere to implicit constraints on output values as dictated by the transformation pattern.\n*   **Solution Generation:** Generates incorrect solutions.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Since the solutions are incorrect, the system doesn't have an effective solution verification process.\n*   **Decision Making:** The system's decision making ability fails as it is not generating correct output grids based on the input grids and training examples.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization.** Without the ability to identify patterns and generalize them to unseen inputs, the system is fundamentally unable to solve the problem.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nImplement the following changes in the next iteration, prioritizing those most likely to impact pattern recognition and generalization:\n\n1.  **Implement Enhanced Feature Engineering:** Focus on features designed to highlight relationships between input and output grids. Specifically calculate difference grids (output - input) to see what values are added and subtracted. Track the locations of these changes relative to other grid features.\n2.  **Integrate Print Statements for Debugging:** Add detailed print statements, especially in the transformation logic (where the grid is modified), to log intermediate values and decisions. This will be crucial for debugging future failures.\n3.  **Modular Reasoning Implementation:** The suggestion of breaking down the transformation process into smaller, more manageable steps should be investigated and implemented. This will allow the system to solve the individual transformation steps first and then transform the grid in sequence.\n4.  **Augmented Training Data:** This is a future goal, but not something that can be changed for the *next* iteration since the report only includes three examples.\n5.  **Attention Mechanisms:** This is a more advanced technique that can be considered later if simpler strategies don't significantly improve performance.\n6.  **Symbolic Reasoning:** This is a more advanced technique that can be considered later if simpler strategies don't significantly improve performance.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0% accuracy), the capabilities are currently **stable** at a very low level. Without significant architectural or algorithmic changes, no improvement is expected. The next iteration will need to show significant improvement to establish an upward trend.\n"

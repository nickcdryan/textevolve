  "approach_summary": "The script employs an iterative question expansion and answer distillation technique with dual verification to answer factual questions. It decomposes the problem into question expansion, answer extraction, internal consistency verification, and external plausibility verification, using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini LLM for each step. The agent roles are defined via system instructions, such as \"expert at expanding questions\". The overall workflow involves iteratively expanding the question and extracting potential answers, verifying them internally, and then verifying the final answer externally for plausibility, returning the answer if both verifications pass.\n`call_llm` is used to call the Gemini LLM with different prompts and system instructions. `main` calls `call_llm` multiple times within a loop to iteratively refine the question and answer.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:**\n\n(Same as provided in the prompt)\n\n**SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS:**\n\n(Same as provided in the prompt)\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs highlight several crucial issues.\n\n*   **Lack of Specificity:** The output for Sample 0 is descriptive rather than factual. The prompt asks for *specific years*, but the system returns a verbose, contextual answer. This indicates a failure to narrow down the retrieved information to the precise data point requested. The surrounding \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest that the system is meant to provide an answer, but it is not extracting and providing the right information.\n*   **Misinformation and Imprecision:** The output for Sample 1 shows an attempt to answer, but includes an incorrect detail (\"fifth digits\"), along with other information, leading to an inaccurate response. This points to flaws in the knowledge retrieval and/or the logic used to combine retrieved facts.\n*   **Failure to Retrieve Information:** Sample 2 returns \"No answer,\" suggesting a complete failure in the knowledge retrieval process. While it's acceptable to return \"No answer\" when confidence is low, the root cause of *why* no answer was found needs investigation. Was the information truly absent, or did the query fail to locate existing data? The consistent \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags, even when no answer is provided, is indicative that the system is at least processing and attempting to provide output.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the AI system demonstrates very limited capabilities. Its primary function is to process questions and trigger a response. However, its capacity to provide accurate, specific, and relevant answers is severely lacking. The system shows promise in identifying the *type* of information requested, but consistently fails to extract or formulate the correct answer. It is better at general awareness than targeted accuracy. The primary issue is the unreliable connection between knowledge sources and answers.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Question Processing:** The system can process and interpret questions.\n*   **Information Type Identification:** The system can identify the type of information required to answer the question. (e.g., years of service, physical characteristics, etc.)\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Knowledge Retrieval:** The system often retrieves incorrect or irrelevant information.\n*   **Poor Answer Formulation:** The system fails to provide concise, accurate, and complete answers.\n*   **Lack of Precision:** The system includes extraneous information or fails to provide specific answers.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **knowledge retrieval accuracy**. Without reliably retrieving the correct information, any improvements in answer formulation will be rendered ineffective. This also impacts the ability to determine when to return no answer if there is nothing to retrieve.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Two-Stage Retrieval Process:**\n    *   **Stage 1: Semantic Search:** Use semantic search to identify potentially relevant documents or knowledge snippets based on the question.\n    *   **Stage 2: Targeted Extraction:** Within the retrieved documents, use a more precise information extraction technique (e.g., named entity recognition, relationship extraction, or pattern matching) to identify the specific data points needed to answer the question. This may require training/fine-tuning models specifically on knowledge retrieval.\n\n2.  **Develop a Ranking and Filtering Mechanism:** Implement a system to rank the retrieved data points based on their relevance and confidence. This ranking should consider factors such as the source of the information, the frequency of its occurrence, and its consistency with other sources. Use this ranking to filter out irrelevant or unreliable information.\n3.  **Enhance the Query Formulation Process:** Improve the way the system formulates queries to its knowledge sources. Experiment with different query formulations, including using keywords, synonyms, and related concepts.\n4.  **Implement Unit Tests for Knowledge Retrieval:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically designed to test the accuracy of the knowledge retrieval process. These tests should cover a wide range of questions and knowledge domains. These tests should ensure the retrieval process returns the right information only.\n5. **Review the \"No Answer\" Decision Threshold:** Carefully evaluate when to return 'No Answer' by establishing a confidence score based on the retrieved information's relevance and reliability. Tune the system to provide an answer only when the confidence level surpasses a determined threshold.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable, at a very low level.** Without significant improvements to knowledge retrieval and answer formulation, the system will continue to produce inaccurate or incomplete answers. Implementing the actionable recommendations is crucial to drive a positive trend.\n",

    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:**\n\n(Same as provided in the prompt)\n\n**SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS:**\n\n(Same as provided in the prompt)\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs highlight several crucial issues.\n\n*   **Lack of Specificity:** The output for Sample 0 is descriptive rather than factual. The prompt asks for *specific years*, but the system returns a verbose, contextual answer. This indicates a failure to narrow down the retrieved information to the precise data point requested. The surrounding \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags suggest that the system is meant to provide an answer, but it is not extracting and providing the right information.\n*   **Misinformation and Imprecision:** The output for Sample 1 shows an attempt to answer, but includes an incorrect detail (\"fifth digits\"), along with other information, leading to an inaccurate response. This points to flaws in the knowledge retrieval and/or the logic used to combine retrieved facts.\n*   **Failure to Retrieve Information:** Sample 2 returns \"No answer,\" suggesting a complete failure in the knowledge retrieval process. While it's acceptable to return \"No answer\" when confidence is low, the root cause of *why* no answer was found needs investigation. Was the information truly absent, or did the query fail to locate existing data? The consistent \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags, even when no answer is provided, is indicative that the system is at least processing and attempting to provide output.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the AI system demonstrates very limited capabilities. Its primary function is to process questions and trigger a response. However, its capacity to provide accurate, specific, and relevant answers is severely lacking. The system shows promise in identifying the *type* of information requested, but consistently fails to extract or formulate the correct answer. It is better at general awareness than targeted accuracy. The primary issue is the unreliable connection between knowledge sources and answers.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Question Processing:** The system can process and interpret questions.\n*   **Information Type Identification:** The system can identify the type of information required to answer the question. (e.g., years of service, physical characteristics, etc.)\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Knowledge Retrieval:** The system often retrieves incorrect or irrelevant information.\n*   **Poor Answer Formulation:** The system fails to provide concise, accurate, and complete answers.\n*   **Lack of Precision:** The system includes extraneous information or fails to provide specific answers.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **knowledge retrieval accuracy**. Without reliably retrieving the correct information, any improvements in answer formulation will be rendered ineffective. This also impacts the ability to determine when to return no answer if there is nothing to retrieve.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Two-Stage Retrieval Process:**\n    *   **Stage 1: Semantic Search:** Use semantic search to identify potentially relevant documents or knowledge snippets based on the question.\n    *   **Stage 2: Targeted Extraction:** Within the retrieved documents, use a more precise information extraction technique (e.g., named entity recognition, relationship extraction, or pattern matching) to identify the specific data points needed to answer the question. This may require training/fine-tuning models specifically on knowledge retrieval.\n\n2.  **Develop a Ranking and Filtering Mechanism:** Implement a system to rank the retrieved data points based on their relevance and confidence. This ranking should consider factors such as the source of the information, the frequency of its occurrence, and its consistency with other sources. Use this ranking to filter out irrelevant or unreliable information.\n3.  **Enhance the Query Formulation Process:** Improve the way the system formulates queries to its knowledge sources. Experiment with different query formulations, including using keywords, synonyms, and related concepts.\n4.  **Implement Unit Tests for Knowledge Retrieval:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically designed to test the accuracy of the knowledge retrieval process. These tests should cover a wide range of questions and knowledge domains. These tests should ensure the retrieval process returns the right information only.\n5. **Review the \"No Answer\" Decision Threshold:** Carefully evaluate when to return 'No Answer' by establishing a confidence score based on the retrieved information's relevance and reliability. Tune the system to provide an answer only when the confidence level surpasses a determined threshold.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable, at a very low level.** Without significant improvements to knowledge retrieval and answer formulation, the system will continue to produce inaccurate or incomplete answers. Implementing the actionable recommendations is crucial to drive a positive trend.\n"

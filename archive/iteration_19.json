  "approach_summary": "The script implements a \"Transformation by Rule Extraction and Decomposition with Multi-Agent Reasoning\" approach using two agents: a Rule Extraction Agent and a Rule Decomposition & Application Agent. The problem is decomposed into extracting transformation rules from training examples and then decomposing and applying those rules to a test input. The script uses `preprocess_question` to extract training examples and test input, `extract_transformation_rule` to extract the rule, `decompose_and_apply_rule` to decompose and apply the rule, and `call_llm` to interface with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves extracting data, extracting a rule using one agent, decomposing and applying the rule using another agent, and returning the transformed grid.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and tailored to be specific, actionable, and focused on concrete improvements:\n\n**CAPABILITY REPORT**\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system attempts to decompose the instructions, identify a region, and modify cell values. However, the selection of rows/columns (2 to 10, 4 to 6) and the value to replace (0 with 3) appear arbitrary and unrelated to any pattern in the training data (which wasn't provided, but we can infer from the error report that it's not represented correctly). The identified region also seems to be offset/incorrectly interpreted, leading to a modified grid that bears little resemblance to the expected output. The system hallucinated the existence of '0' values within the grid, triggering the replacement.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system attempts to identify transformation rules from the training examples, listing several examples. However, the interpretations of the transformations are inaccurate and incomplete. For instance, it misinterprets the condition for replacing values and falsely claims there's no '4' or '5' in the grid. When applying the rules it doesn't seem to be referencing the input grid at all and introduces '8's in seemingly random locations. The logic for example 3 is implemented, which replaces '1' with '2' in the specified column.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system aims to determine grid dimensions and creates a new grid based on the left half of the input. However, the resulting grid has a different number of columns than the training examples and the expected output and appears to have collapsed everything into the left half.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates a very low level of capability in solving grid transformation problems. While it shows some ability to decompose the problem into steps and attempt to identify rules, it consistently fails in:\n\n*   **Accurate Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to identify meaningful patterns and relationships within the training data.\n*   **Correct Rule Extraction and Generalization:** The extracted rules are often inaccurate, incomplete, and poorly generalized.\n*   **Consistent Rule Application:** The system is unable to apply the extracted rules consistently and accurately across the entire test grid.\n*   **Adhering to Constraints:** The system often ignores constraints imposed by the training data or the problem statement.\n*   **Dimensional Awareness:** The system struggles to maintain correct grid dimensions after transformations.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Attempt at Decomposition:** The system tries to break down the task into smaller, manageable steps.\n*   **Rule-Based Approach (Attempted):** The system attempts to formulate rules based on training examples, which is a sound strategy.\n*   **Grid Reconstruction:** The system can generate a new grid based on its derived rules.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Recognition and Rule Extraction:** This is the most significant weakness. The system's inability to correctly identify and codify transformation patterns renders the rest of its functionality ineffective.\n*   **Inconsistent Rule Application:** Even with partially correct rules, the system struggles to apply them uniformly and accurately.\n*   **Ignoring Context and Constraints:** The system frequently overlooks the context established by the training examples and disregards constraints.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Instructions:** Demonstrated by problems in following the dimensionality constraints, or hallucinating the existence of cells that don't exist.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Pattern Recognition and Rule Extraction**. Without this, the system cannot effectively solve the problems.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Pattern Recognition:**\n    *   *Details:* Train a CNN specifically designed to identify patterns in grid transformations. The input would be the training grids, and the output would be a set of features or a vector representing the transformation rule.\n    *   *Rationale:* CNNs are highly effective at identifying spatial patterns and relationships in image data, making them well-suited for this task.\n    *   *Implementation Steps:*\n        *   Prepare the training data by encoding each grid as an image.\n        *   Design a CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.\n        *   Train the CNN to predict the transformation rule (represented as a vector or a set of parameters).\n        *   Fine-tune the CNN on a validation set to optimize its performance.\n\n2.  **Develop a Rule Extraction Mechanism Based on Formal Grammar:**\n    *   *Details:* Use a formal grammar to represent the transformation rules. This grammar would define the syntax and semantics of the rules, making them more precise and easier to interpret.\n    *   *Rationale:* A formal grammar provides a structured way to represent transformation rules, ensuring consistency and completeness.\n    *   *Implementation Steps:*\n        *   Define a formal grammar for grid transformations, including elements such as cell selection, value replacement, and region transformations.\n        *   Implement a parser that can extract rules from the training examples and represent them using the formal grammar.\n        *   Create a rule engine that can apply the extracted rules to the test grid.\n\n3.  **Incorporate a Validation Step Using Training Examples:**\n    *   *Details:* Before applying a rule to the test grid, validate it against the training examples to ensure that it produces reasonable results.

    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and tailored to be specific, actionable, and focused on concrete improvements:\n\n**CAPABILITY REPORT**\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system attempts to decompose the instructions, identify a region, and modify cell values. However, the selection of rows/columns (2 to 10, 4 to 6) and the value to replace (0 with 3) appear arbitrary and unrelated to any pattern in the training data (which wasn't provided, but we can infer from the error report that it's not represented correctly). The identified region also seems to be offset/incorrectly interpreted, leading to a modified grid that bears little resemblance to the expected output. The system hallucinated the existence of '0' values within the grid, triggering the replacement.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system attempts to identify transformation rules from the training examples, listing several examples. However, the interpretations of the transformations are inaccurate and incomplete. For instance, it misinterprets the condition for replacing values and falsely claims there's no '4' or '5' in the grid. When applying the rules it doesn't seem to be referencing the input grid at all and introduces '8's in seemingly random locations. The logic for example 3 is implemented, which replaces '1' with '2' in the specified column.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system aims to determine grid dimensions and creates a new grid based on the left half of the input. However, the resulting grid has a different number of columns than the training examples and the expected output and appears to have collapsed everything into the left half.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates a very low level of capability in solving grid transformation problems. While it shows some ability to decompose the problem into steps and attempt to identify rules, it consistently fails in:\n\n*   **Accurate Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to identify meaningful patterns and relationships within the training data.\n*   **Correct Rule Extraction and Generalization:** The extracted rules are often inaccurate, incomplete, and poorly generalized.\n*   **Consistent Rule Application:** The system is unable to apply the extracted rules consistently and accurately across the entire test grid.\n*   **Adhering to Constraints:** The system often ignores constraints imposed by the training data or the problem statement.\n*   **Dimensional Awareness:** The system struggles to maintain correct grid dimensions after transformations.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Attempt at Decomposition:** The system tries to break down the task into smaller, manageable steps.\n*   **Rule-Based Approach (Attempted):** The system attempts to formulate rules based on training examples, which is a sound strategy.\n*   **Grid Reconstruction:** The system can generate a new grid based on its derived rules.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Recognition and Rule Extraction:** This is the most significant weakness. The system's inability to correctly identify and codify transformation patterns renders the rest of its functionality ineffective.\n*   **Inconsistent Rule Application:** Even with partially correct rules, the system struggles to apply them uniformly and accurately.\n*   **Ignoring Context and Constraints:** The system frequently overlooks the context established by the training examples and disregards constraints.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Instructions:** Demonstrated by problems in following the dimensionality constraints, or hallucinating the existence of cells that don't exist.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Pattern Recognition and Rule Extraction**.

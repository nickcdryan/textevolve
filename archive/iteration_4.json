  "approach_summary": "The script uses visual analogy reasoning with structured rule representation to transform a grid. The problem is decomposed into identifying a transformation rule from training examples and applying it to a test input. The agent roles are visual pattern recognition expert and expert grid transformer, both implemented via prompting. Functions include `main` (overall orchestration), `split_question` (splits input), `identify_transformation_rule` (identifies transformation rule using an LLM), `apply_transformation` (applies the rule to the test input using an LLM), and `dummy_call_llm` (a placeholder for the LLM call). The overall workflow involves splitting the input, identifying the transformation rule using the LLM, applying the rule to the test input using the LLM, and returning the transformed grid.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe provided error cases all have the output \"Dummy LLM Output\". This strongly suggests that the underlying Language Model (LLM) is not being properly invoked or is failing to produce meaningful results. There are no specific error messages like JSONDecodeError or TypeError, implying that the problem lies before or after the LLM's execution, or within the LLM itself if it's simply returning a default value on failure. The absence of runtime errors makes debugging more challenging as it masks the underlying cause of the failures.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to identify specific strengths, as all cases resulted in a dummy output. However, we can infer potential strengths:\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding:** The system seems to be able to at least ingest the input, parse the question, and identify the input grid. The fact that a \"Dummy LLM Output\" is generated suggests it understands it *should* be generating something, rather than crashing outright.\n2.  **Infrastructure for execution:** The framework appears to be set up to receive the input, call the LLM, and handle the output, even if the LLM call is currently failing or returning a placeholder.\n3. **Data Handling:** The system is able to load and represent the grid data in a processable format.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **LLM Reasoning/Transformation Failure:** The core weakness is the system's inability to correctly transform the input grid based on the provided examples. The LLM is either not being provided with the right prompt, is incapable of understanding the pattern, or is failing to output a valid grid structure.\n2.  **Error Handling and Debugging:** The \"Dummy LLM Output\" makes it extremely difficult to debug the underlying issue. The system needs more informative error messages or logging to understand where the transformation process is failing. There is no insight into why the LLM is generating this dummy output.\n3. **Lack of Specificity:** The prompt given to the LLM might be too vague or not contain sufficient information about the examples provided. This could cause the LLM to fail to understand the transformation and return the dummy output.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM Pattern Recognition and Transformation:** The most critical bottleneck is the LLM's inability to recognize the underlying patterns in the training examples and apply them to the test input to generate the correct output grid.\n2.  **Insufficient Debugging Information:** The lack of detailed logs or error messages from the LLM hinders debugging and identifying the root cause of the failure.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe primary error pattern is the consistent \"Dummy LLM Output\" across all failed cases. This indicates a systematic issue with the LLM integration or the LLM's ability to solve the problem, rather than individual case-specific errors.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **LLM's failure to perform grid transformations as demonstrated in the training examples, resulting in a placeholder output.** This could be due to a poorly designed prompt, the LLM's limitations, or an incorrect implementation of the transformation logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Design a more effective prompt that clearly conveys the task, the format of the input and output grids, and the desired transformation logic. Experiment with different prompting strategies (e.g., few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting).\n2.  **Debugging and Logging:** Implement detailed logging within the LLM interaction to capture the prompt sent to the LLM, the LLM's response (even if incorrect), and any intermediate steps or errors encountered during the transformation process. This includes logging the model configuration, the raw request and response, and timestamps.\n3.  **Input Representation/Parsing:** Improve the system's ability to parse the grid information into a format easily understood by the LLM.\n4.  **Output Validation:** Implement validation checks to ensure the LLM's output conforms to the expected grid format. If the output is invalid, log an error and potentially re-prompt the LLM with a more specific instruction.\n5.  **Consider alternative reasoning approaches**: Instead of relying entirely on the LLM to understand the reasoning, break down the task into smaller more manageable steps.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Prompt Engineering:**\n    *   **Be Explicit:** Explicitly state in the prompt that the LLM must output a valid grid structure and provide examples of the expected format.\n    *   **Decompose the task:** Break down the transformation into smaller, more manageable steps and guide the LLM through each step. For instance, first ask the LLM to identify the transformation pattern, then ask it to apply the pattern to the test grid.\n    *   **Add constraints:** Add constraints to the prompt, such as \"Maintain the grid size\" or \"Only modify cells based on the identified pattern.\"\n2.  **Debugging and Logging:**\n    *   **Log Prompt and Response:** Log the exact prompt sent to the LLM and the raw response received.\n    *   **Implement Intermediate Logging:** If possible, log intermediate steps performed by the LLM during the transformation process.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Implement specific error handling to catch exceptions during the LLM interaction and log informative error messages.\n3.  **Input/Output Validation:**\n    *   **Validate Output Format:** After receiving the LLM's response, validate that it is a valid grid structure (e.g., a 2D array of numbers).\n    *   **Data Type Validation:** Confirm that data types are correct before and after the LLM invocation.\n4.  **Error output modification** Replace the \"Dummy LLM output\" with an actual error message so that you know exactly what went wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Likely successful (input grid is parsed)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (no constraints appear to be applied)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (dummy output indicates no solution generated)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (dummy output is not a valid solution)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (no decision made)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Likely successful\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed\n    *   solution_generation: Failed\n    *   solution_verification: Failed\n    *   decision_making: Failed\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Likely successful\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed\n    *   solution_generation: Failed\n    *   solution_verification: Failed\n    *   decision_making: Failed\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and my expertise as a System Capability Analyst:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs show a consistent and concerning pattern: every sample resulted in \"Dummy LLM Output\".  The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest a rudimentary framework for isolating the LLM's response, but the content within those markers is completely uninformative.  The presence of these markers *could* indicate successful execution up to the point of receiving the LLM output, but this is not confirmed. The consistent nature of this output points towards a systemic issue, not isolated errors.  The system appears to be able to run the code and give the appropriate \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" but is unable to successfully invoke the LLM.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates **extremely limited capabilities**. While it can ingest input data and likely parse it into a processable format, it utterly fails at the core task of performing grid transformations based on provided examples.  Essentially, it can *receive* information, but cannot *process* it into a meaningful output. Its accuracy is currently 0%, making it unusable in its current state. The framework might be partially functional, but the LLM integration is fundamentally broken or ineffective.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Infrastructure:** The system has a basic infrastructure for receiving input, invoking (or attempting to invoke) the LLM, and producing a structured output (with the start/end markers). This provides a foundation to build upon.\n*   **Potential for Data Handling:** The system is able to load and represent the grid data in a processable format, as indicated by the ability to call the LLM.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Fundamental LLM Failure:** The LLM is consistently failing to perform the required grid transformation. This is the **most critical weakness**.\n*   **Debugging Blindness:** The \"Dummy LLM Output\" provides zero insight into the cause of the failure. This severely hampers debugging efforts.  The lack of detailed logging is a critical deficiency.\n*   **Lack of Output Validation:** There's no mechanism to detect or handle the dummy output, which indicates a missing validation step.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **LLM Reasoning and Transformation**. The system must be able to leverage the LLM to correctly transform the input grid based on the training examples.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, prioritized for maximum impact:\n\n1.  **Implement Detailed Logging:**\n    *   **Log Everything:** Log the exact prompt sent to the LLM, the complete (raw) response received from the LLM (even if it's the dummy output), timestamps for each interaction, and any intermediate steps within the system related to the LLM call.  Include model name/version, and any API keys/credentials used (redacted, if necessary).\n    *   **Structured Logging:** Use a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) to make it easier to analyze logs programmatically.\n    *   **Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to control the verbosity of the logs. Start with DEBUG level logging to capture as much information as possible during the debugging phase.\n2.  **Fix the \"Dummy LLM Output\" Problem:**\n    *   **Identify the Source:** Determine *exactly* where the \"Dummy LLM Output\" is being generated. Is it the LLM itself, or is it a placeholder inserted by your system when the LLM call fails?\n    *   **Replace with Error Message:** Instead of the dummy output, replace it with a descriptive error message that indicates *why* the LLM call failed. For example: \"LLM API timeout\", \"Invalid LLM response format\", \"LLM returned empty response\", \"LLM authentication error\", etc. Use exception handling to display the error.\n3.  **Revise the LLM Prompt:**\n    *   **Detailed Instructions:**  Create a much more explicit and detailed prompt. Clearly define the task, the format of the input and output grids, and the transformation logic.\n    *   **Few-Shot Learning:**  Include more examples in the prompt to demonstrate the desired transformation pattern.\n    *   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Guide the LLM through the reasoning process step-by-step. For example, ask it to first identify the pattern, then explain how the pattern should be applied, and finally generate the transformed grid.\n    *   **Prompt Templates:** Use prompt templates that allow you to easily modify and experiment with different prompting strategies.\n4.  **Implement Output Validation:**\n    *   **Format Validation:**  After receiving the LLM's response, validate that it conforms to the expected grid format (e.g., a 2D array of numbers).\n    *   **Data Type Validation:**  Ensure that the data types are correct (e.g., numbers are actually numbers).\n    *   **Content Validation:**  Implement checks to ensure that the transformed grid is consistent with the identified pattern (e.g., if the pattern is \"add 1 to each cell\", verify that each cell's value has been incremented by 1).\n5. **Check API Credentials:**\n    * Make sure that the API key and credentials for the LLM is correct.\n    * Make sure that the API you are using is up to date.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0% accuracy), the capability trend is **stable at a very low level.** Without significant changes, the system is not improving. The trend will remain flat until the core LLM reasoning and transformation issues are addressed.\n",

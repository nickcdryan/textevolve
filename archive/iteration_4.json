  "approach_summary": "The script addresses grid transformation problems using an LLM with a chain-of-thought approach, incorporating rule extraction, application, and a verification loop. The problem is decomposed into extracting examples/test input, extracting a transformation rule based on positional reasoning, applying the rule, and verifying the output. The agent acts as a rule extractor, transformer, and verifier. The core functions used are `call_llm`, which interfaces with the Gemini model, and `solve_grid_transformation`, which orchestrates the extraction, transformation, and verification steps. The `solve_grid_transformation` function calls `call_llm` multiple times to extract information, derive the transformation rule, apply the rule, and verify the result, refining the rule based on verification feedback in a loop.",

However, the outputs consistently demonstrate a failure to correctly interpret and apply the transformation patterns present in the training examples. This implies logical errors within the reasoning process rather than immediate runtime crashes.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Array/Grid Representation:** The system correctly represents the input and output as 2D arrays/grids.\n2.  **Output Format:** The system successfully provides the output in the required array format, wrapped in `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system fails to accurately identify and replicate the transformation patterns demonstrated in the training examples. It doesn't seem to grasp the relationship between the input and output grids.\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:** The system appears to lack the ability to understand the context and apply the correct transformation rules based on the specific arrangement of numbers in the input grid.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Abstract Pattern Understanding:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to extract and generalize abstract patterns from the training examples. It's failing to move beyond memorization to true pattern comprehension.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Incorrect Transformation:** In all the error cases, the output grid generated by the system bears little to no resemblance to the correct output grid. The numbers are misplaced, the pattern is not followed, and the overall structure is completely different.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the failure to correctly identify and apply the transformation rules illustrated in the training examples. The system is not generalizing from the examples and is producing nonsensical outputs for the test input. This stems from a lack of robust pattern recognition and reasoning capabilities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Implement a more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithm that can analyze the training examples and identify the underlying transformation rules.\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to understand the context of the grid and apply the transformation rules accordingly.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are known for their ability to detect spatial patterns. Consider using a CNN architecture to learn the transformation rules from the training examples.\n2.  **Implement a Rule-Based System:** Design a rule-based system that explicitly defines the transformation rules based on the analysis of the training examples. This could involve identifying specific features in the input grid and applying corresponding transformations to generate the output grid.\n3.  **Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data by creating variations of the existing examples to improve the system's ability to generalize.\n4. **Add Intermediate Steps and Print Statements:** Add a rule based system that attempts to recognize patterns and then implements a series of print statements showing each of the rules that it has determined. This will allow for easier tracing and debugging in the future.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly extracting the transformation pattern)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generating an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (not able to verify that the output is correct)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly extracting the transformation pattern)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generating an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (not able to verify that the output is correct)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly extracting the transformation pattern)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generating an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (not able to verify that the output is correct)\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report based on the performance data you provided:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently demonstrate a profound inability to generalize from training examples to the provided test inputs.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output generates a near-empty grid, primarily filled with zeros. It inserts a few numbers (5, 4, 1) in the bottom rows, seemingly at random locations, which indicates a failure to grasp any meaningful transformation pattern or apply context awareness to those transformations.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The output produces a grid filled with alternating 0s, 3s, and 8s, arranging them in a repeating pattern that doesn't seem related to any underlying transformation. The repeating pattern also suggests it may be following a generic pattern rather than anything specific to the data.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The output creates a grid with scattered 1s, 4s, and 2s. This is a slightly better outcome, though still fails to produce the correct output.\n\nAll outputs lack any correlation to the task's intended transformation. This suggests a fundamental issue with pattern extraction and application. The repetitive nature of some of the incorrect outputs might indicate the system is defaulting to basic, pre-programmed behaviors instead of learning from the data.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently possesses very limited capabilities in the target task. It demonstrates a basic ability to represent the data in the correct format (2D array) and to output the answer within the specified delimiters. However, its core function \u2013 identifying and applying transformations \u2013 is essentially non-existent, resulting in a 0% accuracy rate.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Data Representation:** Ability to represent input and output as 2D arrays.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Adherence to the required output format (using `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags).\n\nThese strengths are foundational but relatively trivial compared to the primary goal of the system.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The system struggles to generalize from training examples and apply learned patterns to new inputs.\n*   **Transformation Logic:** It fails to correctly implement the transformation logic, resulting in completely incorrect outputs.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** The system shows no ability to understand the context of the grid and apply transformations based on the arrangement of numbers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. The system must be able to extract abstract patterns from training data and apply them effectively to unseen inputs. Without this capability, it will continue to produce nonsensical outputs.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement CNN-Based Pattern Recognition:**\n    *   Introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs excel at spatial pattern recognition, making them suitable for identifying transformation patterns within grids.\n    *   *Implementation Details*:\n        *   Reshape the input grids into a format suitable for CNN input.\n        *   Experiment with different CNN architectures, layer configurations, and activation functions.\n        *   Focus on architectures known for image recognition tasks, adapting them to the grid transformation problem.\n        *   Implement a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted output grid and the correct output grid (e.g., Mean Squared Error).\n\n2.  **Introduce a Rule-Based Pattern Detection and Logging System:**\n    *   Implement a component that attempts to recognize specific visual and numerical patterns in the input grid and training examples.\n    *   *Implementation Details*:\n        *   Define a set of pattern recognition rules (e.g., \"If a '5' is adjacent to a '4', replace the '4' with a '2'\").\n        *   Add extensive logging/print statements to trace the identified patterns and the rules being applied.  This is crucial for debugging. Log which rule was triggered and the specific locations it was triggered on.\n        *   This system doesn't have to *solve* the problem initially, but it must *attempt* to recognize patterns and provide a detailed trace of its thought process.\n        *   The rule-based system should operate *before* any other AI models are invoked.  This way, you know what features the rule-based system detected before passing control to the rest of the system.\n\n3.  **Refactor Data Preprocessing:**\n    *   Ensure the input data is preprocessed consistently and effectively.\n    *   *Implementation Details*:\n        *   Normalize the input grid values to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1) to improve CNN performance.\n        *   Standardize the grid sizes to avoid issues with varying input dimensions.\n        *   Consider adding noise or slight variations to the training data during preprocessing to improve robustness.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are currently **stable but critically low**. The system consistently fails to perform the core task, indicating no improvement in pattern recognition or transformation logic. The trend is neither improving nor declining, but rather stuck at a baseline of near-zero functionality. The implementation of the actionable recommendations above will be necessary to shift this trend upward.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError in the provided outputs. However, the outputs consistently demonstrate a failure to correctly interpret and apply the transformation patterns present in the training examples. This implies logical errors within the reasoning process rather than immediate runtime crashes.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Array/Grid Representation:** The system correctly represents the input and output as 2D arrays/grids.\n2.  **Output Format:** The system successfully provides the output in the required array format, wrapped in `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system fails to accurately identify and replicate the transformation patterns demonstrated in the training examples. It doesn't seem to grasp the relationship between the input and output grids.\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:** The system appears to lack the ability to understand the context and apply the correct transformation rules based on the specific arrangement of numbers in the input grid.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Abstract Pattern Understanding:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to extract and generalize abstract patterns from the training examples. It's failing to move beyond memorization to true pattern comprehension.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Incorrect Transformation:** In all the error cases, the output grid generated by the system bears little to no resemblance to the correct output grid. The numbers are misplaced, the pattern is not followed, and the overall structure is completely different.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the failure to correctly identify and apply the transformation rules illustrated in the training examples. The system is not generalizing from the examples and is producing nonsensical outputs for the test input. This stems from a lack of robust pattern recognition and reasoning capabilities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Implement a more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithm that can analyze the training examples and identify the underlying transformation rules.\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to understand the context of the grid and apply the transformation rules accordingly.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are known for their ability to detect spatial patterns. Consider using a CNN architecture to learn the transformation rules from the training examples.\n2.  **Implement a Rule-Based System:** Design a rule-based system that explicitly defines the transformation rules based on the analysis of the training examples. This could involve identifying specific features in the input grid and applying corresponding transformations to generate the output grid.\n3.  **Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data by creating variations of the existing examples to improve the system's ability to generalize.\n4. **Add Intermediate Steps and Print Statements:** Add a rule based system that attempts to recognize patterns and then implements a series of print statements showing each of the rules that it has determined. This will allow for easier tracing and debugging in the future.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly extracting the transformation pattern)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generating an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (not able to verify that the output is correct)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly extracting the transformation pattern)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generating an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (not able to verify that the output is correct)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly extracting the transformation pattern)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generating an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (not able to verify that the output is correct)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report based on the performance data you provided:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently demonstrate a profound inability to generalize from training examples to the provided test inputs.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output generates a near-empty grid, primarily filled with zeros. It inserts a few numbers (5, 4, 1) in the bottom rows, seemingly at random locations, which indicates a failure to grasp any meaningful transformation pattern or apply context awareness to those transformations.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The output produces a grid filled with alternating 0s, 3s, and 8s, arranging them in a repeating pattern that doesn't seem related to any underlying transformation. The repeating pattern also suggests it may be following a generic pattern rather than anything specific to the data.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The output creates a grid with scattered 1s, 4s, and 2s. This is a slightly better outcome, though still fails to produce the correct output.\n\nAll outputs lack any correlation to the task's intended transformation. This suggests a fundamental issue with pattern extraction and application. The repetitive nature of some of the incorrect outputs might indicate the system is defaulting to basic, pre-programmed behaviors instead of learning from the data.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently possesses very limited capabilities in the target task. It demonstrates a basic ability to represent the data in the correct format (2D array) and to output the answer within the specified delimiters. However, its core function \u2013 identifying and applying transformations \u2013 is essentially non-existent, resulting in a 0% accuracy rate.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Data Representation:** Ability to represent input and output as 2D arrays.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Adherence to the required output format (using `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags).\n\nThese strengths are foundational but relatively trivial compared to the primary goal of the system.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The system struggles to generalize from training examples and apply learned patterns to new inputs.\n*   **Transformation Logic:** It fails to correctly implement the transformation logic, resulting in completely incorrect outputs.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** The system shows no ability to understand the context of the grid and apply transformations based on the arrangement of numbers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. The system must be able to extract abstract patterns from training data and apply them effectively to unseen inputs.

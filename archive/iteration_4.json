  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings using LLM-driven techniques, including constraint extraction, verification, and solution finding, by providing examples in the prompts. The problem is decomposed into constraint extraction, verification of the extracted constraints, finding available times based on constraints, and verifying the proposed solution. Several functions are used: `extract_constraints_with_examples` extracts scheduling constraints from the input text, `verify_extracted_constraints` checks the extracted constraints, `find_available_times_with_examples` finds meeting times, and `verify_solution_with_examples` verifies the solution; all of these functions make a call to the `call_llm` function to send the prompt to the LLM. The overall workflow involves extracting constraints, verifying them, finding an available time, verifying the solution, and returning the proposed time or an error message.",

While it can iterate through potential time slots, its conflict detection logic is unreliable, limiting its overall utility. The system requires a focused effort to improve constraint handling and solution verification. Overall, the system shows promise but needs substantial refinement to achieve reliable performance.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accurate Identification of Basic Parameters**: Correctly identifies the available time range (9:00 to 17:00) and the required duration (30 minutes). This shows the base parsing is adequate.\n*   **Iterative Time Slot Processing**: The system attempts to iterate through possible 30-minute slots, indicating a correct general approach.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Schedule Parsing and Conflict Detection**: The system fails to correctly determine whether specific time slots are blocked or available based on the provided schedules, resulting in frequent false negatives.

This directly addresses the primary issue of false negatives in availability detection. This improvement will require better parsing of the schedule and verification of that parsing.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust Verification Agent**: Create an independent verifier agent (using an LLM call) that confirms the availability of each participant for a proposed time slot by re-checking their schedules.

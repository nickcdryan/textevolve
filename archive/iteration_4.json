  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using a two-step LLM approach: spatial encoding and transformation prediction, followed by verification and application. The problem is decomposed into identifying the transformation rule and then applying it to the input grid. The LLM acts as an expert in identifying grid transformation patterns.\n\n`main` calls `solve_grid_transformation` with the input question, which in turn calls `call_llm` to get the predicted and verified transformations. `call_llm` interfaces with the Gemini API. The overall workflow involves prompting the LLM to predict the transformation, verifying the prediction, and then using the LLM again to apply the transformation, with error handling and retries.",

This is the primary bottleneck.\n*   **Constraint Learning and Application:** The system fails to internalize and apply constraints that define where and how numbers should be placed or transformed within the grid.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Inconsistent Transformations:** The system does not apply consistent transformations. Numbers appear to be placed seemingly randomly or with patterns that are not easily discernible from the training data.\n*   **Ignoring Input Values:** In some cases, the initial input values are not correctly reflected or transformed in the output.\n*   **Failure to Replicate Patterns:** Repeated elements and their positions are often inconsistent across examples, suggesting a lack of ability to learn and replicate placement rules.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to recognize and extrapolate the transformation patterns from the training examples to the test input. The learned transformations are either non-existent or are misapplied, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Enhance the system's ability to recognize complex spatial patterns and relationships within the input and output grids.\n*   **Constraint Learning:** Improve the capability to learn and represent constraints derived from the examples and apply them to the test case.\n*   **Generalization:** Improve the system's ability to generalize from a small number of examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n*   **Introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Given that the task is grid-based, CNNs are well-suited for pattern recognition and feature extraction. Incorporate CNN layers to identify spatial relationships and patterns in the grids.\n*   **Attention Mechanisms:** Add attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant parts of the input grid when generating the output.\n*   **Constraint Encoding:** Explicitly encode learned constraints in the model. For example, one could add a module which, given an input-output pair, determines rules like \"if there is a '3' at (x, y) in input, add an '8' at (x+1, y+1) in the output\".\n*   **Meta-Learning or Few-Shot Learning Techniques:** Explore meta-learning approaches that are specifically designed for learning from a limited number of examples.\n*   **Increase Training Data:** If possible, augment the training data with more examples or variations of existing examples.\n*   **Simplify the Transformation Logic:** Simplify the transformations (e.g., only shifting values or duplicating patterns) and progressively increase complexity to make it easier to debug and understand the system's behavior.\n*   **Intermediate Visualizations:** Add code to visualize the intermediate states of the grid during transformation.

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis. The system generates valid grid structures (2D arrays) and occasionally places numbers within the grid. However, the number placement appears arbitrary and unrelated to the patterns present in training data (not provided, but assumed from the Error Analysis). There's no discernible logic connecting input to output. The diversity of errors across the three samples further suggests an inability to generalize or learn from the few available examples. The system fails to reliably replicate even simple elements or placements. The outputs consist of either mostly zeros or random arrangements of numbers, demonstrating a complete breakdown in transformation logic.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates a very low level of capability in solving the given grid transformation task. It possesses a rudimentary understanding of the data structure (2D arrays) but fails entirely at the core objective of recognizing and applying patterns to transform input grids into desired output grids. It lacks the essential pattern recognition, constraint handling, and generalization skills required for this task.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Grid Structure Generation:** The system can generate a valid grid structure in the correct format. This is a basic structural capability that should be maintained as the system evolves.\n*   **Partial Number Placement:** The system can place some numbers in the grid. This suggests some rudimentary understanding of placing values within a grid structure.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition Failure:** The system consistently fails to recognize and extrapolate transformation patterns.\n*   **Constraint Violation:** The system doesn't adhere to any discernible constraints when generating the output.\n*   **Generalization Deficiency:** The system is unable to generalize from a small number of training examples (presumed).\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition**. Without the ability to reliably identify and understand the transformation patterns, the system cannot perform the task. All other improvements depend on this foundational capability.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Introduce Convolutional Layers:** Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as the core pattern recognition component. Start with a simple CNN architecture and progressively increase its complexity. Focus on learning spatial relationships.\n2.  **Visualize Intermediate Representations:** Add visualization tools to expose the intermediate outputs of the CNN layers. This will help in understanding what features the CNN is learning (or failing to learn) from the input grids.\n3.  **Data Augmentation:** Even with a small dataset, explore data augmentation techniques specific to grids, such as rotations (90, 180, 270 degrees), mirroring (horizontal and vertical), small translations, and adding noise (introducing minor variations to values).\n4.  **Simplified Task Decomposition:** Initially train the system on simpler transformations (e.g., shifting all numbers one position to the right, or adding a constant value to all numbers). This will help isolate whether the CNN component is functioning correctly before tackling more complex patterns.\n5.  **Implement a Loss Function That Encourages Pattern Similarity:** Instead of a generic loss function (like mean squared error), design a loss function that specifically encourages the output grid to reflect patterns similar to those observed in the training examples.\n6. **Increase Training Data:** If possible, augment the training data with more examples or variations of existing examples.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable at a very low level**. There is no indication of improvement or decline, as the system consistently fails to learn the underlying patterns. The proposed recommendations aim to initiate an upward trend in capability by directly addressing the pattern recognition weakness.\n",

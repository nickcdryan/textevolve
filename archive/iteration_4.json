  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with examples to answer questions based on supporting documents using the Gemini LLM. The problem is decomposed into extracting relevant information from documents and reasoning through examples before addressing the specific question. The script doesn't explicitly define agent roles but implicitly acts as a question-answering agent.\n\nThe script utilizes two functions: `call_llm`, which interacts with the Gemini API to generate responses based on prompts and system instructions, and `main`, which constructs the prompt with chain-of-thought examples and supporting documents, calls the LLM via `call_llm`, and verifies the response. The overall workflow involves constructing a detailed prompt with examples and supporting documents, sending it to the LLM, and returning the generated answer after a basic verification step.",

Started in 1954, and completed in 1988, it is navigable over much of its 1375 km length, and carries 13 km3 of water annually from the Amu-Darya River across the Karakum Desert in Turkmenistan. The canal opened up huge new tracts of land to agriculture, especially to cotton monoculture heavily promoted by the Soviet Union, and supplying Ashgabat with a major source of water. Unfortunately, the primitive construction of the canal allows almost 50\u00a0percent of the water to escape en route, creating lakes and ponds along the canal, and a rise in groundwater leading to widespread soil salinization problems. The canal is also a major factor leading to the Aral Sea environmental disaster. \n\n=== Document 8: New River (Broward County, Florida) ===\nThe New River is a tidal estuary in South Florida, United States.

Between 1984 and 1989 three of the Kaplan turbines were upgraded from 35 MW to 45 MW. Two of the turbines in the 240 MW power station discharge water into a canal on the left bank of the river. Water from this canal serves to irrigate but also supplies the 29.9 MW Perepadnaya and 15.1 MW Centralnaya Hydroelectric Power Plants located further down. The reservoir has a design storage volume of 96000000 m3 by an estimated 80 percent of this is now silt. \n\n=== Document 10: Riverside Canal (El Paso) ===\nThe Riverside Canal is an irrigation canal in El Paso County beginning southeast of El Paso, Texas. The canal acquires water from the Riverside Diversion Dam on the Rio Grande 15 mi southeast of El Paso. The canal is managed by the US Bureau of Reclamation.

Briggs and Thomas were at the time working with Armstrong's performing group, the Sunset Stompers. \n\n=== Document 8: Saint Louis Blues (song) ===\n\"Saint Louis Blues\" is a popular American song composed by W. C. Handy in the blues style and published in September 1914. It remains a fundamental part of jazz musicians' repertoire. It was also one of the first blues songs to succeed as a pop song. It has been performed by numerous musicians in various styles, including Louis Armstrong, Bessie Smith, Count Basie, Glenn Miller, Guy Lombardo, and the Boston Pops Orchestra. It has been called \"the jazzman's \"Hamlet\".\" The 1925 version sung by Bessie Smith, with Louis Armstrong on cornet, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1993. The 1929 version by Louis Armstrong & His Orchestra (with Red Allen) was inducted in 2008. \n\n=== Document 9: Potato Head Blues ===\n\"Potato Head Blues\" is a Louis Armstrong composition regarded as one of his finest recordings. It was made by Louis Armstrong and his Hot Seven for Okeh Records in Chicago, Illinois on May 10, 1927. It was recorded during a remarkably productive week in which Armstrong's usual Hot Five was temporarily expanded to seven players by the addition of tuba and drums; over five sessions the group recorded twelve sides. \n\n=== Document 10: Danny Barcelona ===\nDanny Barcelona (July 23, 1929 \u2013 April 1, 2007) was a jazz drummer best known for his years with Louis Armstrong's All-Stars. He was a Filipino-American born in Waipahu, a community of Honolulu, Hawaii. He was also frequently introduced to audiences by Louis Armstrong as The Little Filipino Boy. Armstrong usually followed up by calling himself \"the little Arabian boy\". \n\n\nProvide your answer based on the information in the supporting documents.",

Therefore, we cannot evaluate the AI's core problem-solving capabilities.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show the same `TypeError`, which highlights a fundamental problem with how the `main()` function is being invoked. The traceback clearly indicates that the `supporting_documents` argument is missing during the function call in `test_script_4.py`. The repeated occurrence of this error across all samples indicates a systematic issue in the test setup rather than a sporadic failure.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nDue to the consistently failing test script, a true capability assessment is impossible. The AI system's ability to process questions and utilize supporting documents to generate answers *cannot* be evaluated. We can only assess the *test infrastructure* which is currently inadequate. The `information_extraction` capability cannot even be tested because the data isn't making it *to* the model for evaluation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\nCurrently, there are no discernible strengths to report.

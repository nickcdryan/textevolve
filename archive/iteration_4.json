  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings using LLM-driven extraction and verification combined with deterministic Python logic. It decomposes the problem into extraction, verification, schedule generation, and final verification stages, relying on the `extract_meeting_info` function for structured data extraction, `verify_extracted_info` for completeness checks, `generate_candidate_schedule` for generating the candidate schedule, and `verify_final_schedule` for final validation, using a series of LLM calls through the `call_llm` function. The overall workflow involves extracting meeting details, verifying their accuracy, generating a candidate schedule (currently a placeholder), and performing a final verification before returning the schedule. The `call_llm` function handles the interaction with the Gemini API.",

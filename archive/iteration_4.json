  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using an LLM to extract meeting details, validate the extracted data, and find a valid meeting time. The problem is decomposed into three stages: `extract_meeting_data`, `validate_extracted_data`, and `find_meeting_time`. Each stage utilizes the `call_llm` function to interact with the LLM. The workflow is sequential: the `main` function calls `extract_meeting_data`, then `validate_extracted_data`, and finally `find_meeting_time`, returning the suggested meeting time or an error message.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your specified sections.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal a few key issues:\n\n*   **Format Consistency:** The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags confirm the system maintains a consistent output format, as noted in the \"STRENGTHS\" section of the error analysis. This is a positive aspect.\n*   **Constraint Violations (Inferred):** Without the input examples used to generate the outputs, we must infer constraint violations from the Error Analysis. The outputs, in isolation, *appear* valid. Therefore, the constraint violation is likely subtle: the proposed times likely conflict with some participants' explicit schedules or preferences.\n*   **Limited Time Range:** The very limited output sample of three results suggests that this assessment involves very simple scheduling problems.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a basic capability for proposing meeting times, but its constraint handling and preference integration are significantly flawed. This renders the proposed solutions unreliable and practically unusable. The core issue appears to be an insufficient understanding of the input constraints or a failure to properly translate them into actionable scheduling rules.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Consistent Output Formatting:** This facilitates parsing and integration with other systems. This should be maintained in future iterations.\n*   **Constraint Awareness (Partial):** The system *attempts* to consider constraints.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Unreliable Constraint Handling:** The system's inability to consistently adhere to explicit scheduling constraints is a critical flaw. This is by far the most significant issue.\n*   **Preference Ignoring:** Ignoring user preferences degrades the quality of the proposed schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**.  Accurate constraint handling is foundational for a functional scheduling system. Without it, the system produces incorrect results, no matter how efficiently it may operate.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, focusing on constraint handling:\n\n1.  **Implement Information Extraction Agent & Schema:**\n    *   **Create:** A specialized information extraction agent designed for scheduling.\n    *   **Focus:** Extracting and structuring participants, existing meetings, blocked time slots (with days and times), and stated preferences (days/times to avoid, preferred durations).\n    *   **Output:** Define a rigorous schema for the information extraction agent to use that structures data as:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"participants\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"string\",\n                \"blocked_timeslots\": [\n                    {\"day\": \"string\", \"start_time\": \"string\", \"end_time\": \"string\"},\n                    ...\n                ],\n                \"preferences\": {\n                    \"avoid_days\": [\"string\"],\n                    \"preferred_duration\": \"integer\"\n                }\n            },\n            ...\n        ],\n        \"meeting_duration\": \"integer\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** Use chain-of-thought prompting so that the LLM justifies why it's extracting and structuring entities.\n    *   **Verification:** Design a parsing-verification agent that checks if the structure follows the schema, and fails/succeeds depending on if the structure adheres to the schema.\n2.  **Develop Explicit Constraint Verification Agent:**\n    *   **Create:** A constraint verification agent that takes a *proposed* meeting time and the extracted schedule information (from the information extraction agent) as inputs.\n    *   **Function:**  This agent rigorously checks whether the proposed time violates *any* constraint (blocked time slots, day preferences).\n    *   **Output:** Binary output (VALID/INVALID) + a detailed explanation of *why* the time is invalid if it violates a constraint.\n    *   **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide the agent with several diverse examples of both valid and invalid times and the reasons why.\n3.  **Implement \"Re-Rank Possible Solutions\" During Solution Generation:**\n    *   **During Solution Generation:** Instead of generating times without explicit checks, generate a wider range of *possible* times, then use the new Constraint Verification Agent to ruthlessly filter out any invalid options.\n    *   **Preference Integration:** Incorporate a scoring mechanism that gives slightly higher scores to times that align with participant preferences (e.g., if someone prefers mornings, slightly favor morning slots).\n    *   **Output:** A much-narrowed set of VALID proposed meeting times that adheres to all constraints with preference scoring as described above.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, given the significant weaknesses in constraint handling, it's likely the system's capabilities are currently **stable (at a low level)**. Improvement requires addressing the fundamental flaws in constraint processing. The proposed recommendations, if implemented effectively, should lead to a positive trend.\n",

This is a positive aspect.\n*   **Constraint Violations (Inferred):** Without the input examples used to generate the outputs, we must infer constraint violations from the Error Analysis. The outputs, in isolation, *appear* valid. Therefore, the constraint violation is likely subtle: the proposed times likely conflict with some participants' explicit schedules or preferences.\n*   **Limited Time Range:** The very limited output sample of three results suggests that this assessment involves very simple scheduling problems.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a basic capability for proposing meeting times, but its constraint handling and preference integration are significantly flawed. This renders the proposed solutions unreliable and practically unusable. The core issue appears to be an insufficient understanding of the input constraints or a failure to properly translate them into actionable scheduling rules.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Consistent Output Formatting:** This facilitates parsing and integration with other systems. This should be maintained in future iterations.\n*   **Constraint Awareness (Partial):** The system *attempts* to consider constraints.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Unreliable Constraint Handling:** The system's inability to consistently adhere to explicit scheduling constraints is a critical flaw. This is by far the most significant issue.\n*   **Preference Ignoring:** Ignoring user preferences degrades the quality of the proposed schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**.  Accurate constraint handling is foundational for a functional scheduling system. Without it, the system produces incorrect results, no matter how efficiently it may operate.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, focusing on constraint handling:\n\n1.  **Implement Information Extraction Agent & Schema:**\n    *   **Create:** A specialized information extraction agent designed for scheduling.\n    *   **Focus:** Extracting and structuring participants, existing meetings, blocked time slots (with days and times), and stated preferences (days/times to avoid, preferred durations).\n    *   **Output:** Define a rigorous schema for the information extraction agent to use that structures data as:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"participants\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"string\",\n                \"blocked_timeslots\": [\n                    {\"day\": \"string\", \"start_time\": \"string\", \"end_time\": \"string\"},\n                    ...\n                ],\n                \"preferences\": {\n                    \"avoid_days\": [\"string\"],\n                    \"preferred_duration\": \"integer\"\n                }\n            },\n            ...\n        ],\n        \"meeting_duration\": \"integer\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    *   **Reasoning:** Use chain-of-thought prompting so that the LLM justifies why it's extracting and structuring entities.\n    *   **Verification:** Design a parsing-verification agent that checks if the structure follows the schema, and fails/succeeds depending on if the structure adheres to the schema.\n2.  **Develop Explicit Constraint Verification Agent:**\n    *   **Create:** A constraint verification agent that takes a *proposed* meeting time and the extracted schedule information (from the information extraction agent) as inputs.\n    *   **Function:**  This agent rigorously checks whether the proposed time violates *any* constraint (blocked time slots, day preferences).\n    *   **Output:** Binary output (VALID/INVALID) + a detailed explanation of *why* the time is invalid if it violates a constraint.\n    *   **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide the agent with several diverse examples of both valid and invalid times and the reasons why.\n3.  **Implement \"Re-Rank Possible Solutions\" During Solution Generation:**\n    *   **During Solution Generation:** Instead of generating times without explicit checks, generate a wider range of *possible* times, then use the new Constraint Verification Agent to ruthlessly filter out any invalid options.\n    *   **Preference Integration:** Incorporate a scoring mechanism that gives slightly higher scores to times that align with participant preferences (e.g., if someone prefers mornings, slightly favor morning slots).\n    *   **Output:** A much-narrowed set of VALID proposed meeting times that adheres to all constraints with preference scoring as described above.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, given the significant weaknesses in constraint handling, it's likely the system's capabilities are currently **stable (at a low level)**. Improvement requires addressing the fundamental flaws in constraint processing. The proposed recommendations, if implemented effectively, should lead to a positive trend.\n"

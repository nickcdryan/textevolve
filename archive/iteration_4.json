  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach, decomposing a question into sub-questions, extracting information, and then synthesizing an answer. It employs three distinct agent roles: a question decomposer, an information extraction expert, and an answer synthesis expert. It leverages the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model using specifically crafted prompts for each agent, and incorporates validation steps after each stage to ensure correctness. The script begins with the `main` function, which orchestrates the calls to `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, and `synthesize_answer`; these functions in turn use `call_llm` to generate responses which undergo validation at each step.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: This Week 12 showdown between the Colts and Eagles was originally scheduled for 1:00 ET, but due to the NFL's \"flexible-scheduling\" system this year, the NFL moved the game to Sunday night at 8:15 ET. This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game. During this game, the Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea, TE Dallas Clark and OT Ryan Diem all to injuries in the first half, and they did not return.\n\nQUESTION: How many touchdowns did Joseph Addai score in the first half?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Following a shocking loss to the 3-7 Kansas City Chiefs the previous week, the Steelers traveled to M&T Bank Stadium for another divisional game. Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off.

In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line.

On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game. During this game, the Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea, TE Dallas Clark and OT Ryan Diem all to injuries in the first half, and they did not return.",

      "original_passage": "Following a shocking loss to the 3-7 Kansas City Chiefs the previous week, the Steelers traveled to M&T Bank Stadium for another divisional game. Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game. With their second consecutive overtime loss, the Steelers fell to 6-5.",

Pittsburgh would strike first in the first quarter with kicker Jeff Reed's 19-yard field goal and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's 27-yard touchdown pass to running back Willie Parker.  The Steelers would add onto their lead in the second quarter as Reed made a 34-yard field goal.  The Bengals would close out the half with kicker Shayne Graham's 34-yard field goal. Cincinnati would creep closer in the third quarter as cornerback Johnathan Joseph returned an interception 30&#160;yards for a touchdown (with a failed PAT), yet Pittsburgh answered with Roethlisberger's 1-yard touchdown run.  However, in the fourth quarter, the Bengals took the lead with running back Cedric Benson's 23-yard touchdown run (with a failed 2-point conversion) and quarterback Carson Palmer's 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Andre Caldwell (with a successful 2-point conversion pass to running back Brian Leonard).  The Steelers tried to rally, but Roethlisberger's last-second hail mary pass was incomplete, preserving the defeat. With the loss, Pittsburgh fell to 1-2 and 3rd place in the AFC North.  This would also become the team's first 1-2 start since 2006. Wide receiver Hines Ward (4 receptions, 82&#160;yards) would become the 21st player in NFL history to surpass 800 career receptions and 10,000 receiving yards.",

However, the brevity of the answers reveals a potential for missing context.  For example, \"38\" might be a correct numerical answer, but without context (e.g., \"38 years old\", \"38 kilometers\"), it's incomplete.  The consistency of the tags implies a structured response generation process, which is good, but the *content* within the tags needs enrichment.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses a strong foundation in information extraction, demonstrating high accuracy in the limited dataset provided. However, its ability to generate complete and contextually rich answers is limited, hindering its potential for real-world applications where nuanced understanding is crucial.  The system excels at *identifying* the correct information but falls short in *presenting* it effectively.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **High Accuracy:** Consistent accuracy (100% in the test set) in information retrieval.\n*   **Structured Output:** Well-defined output format (ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END).\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Contextual Completeness:** Answers often lack essential units, qualifiers, or surrounding context. This is the most critical area to improve.\n*   **Limited Inferential Reasoning:** Reliant on explicit information rather than combining or inferring meaning.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Answer Completeness:**  This is the single most important capability to focus on.  Improving the system's ability to generate complete, self-contained answers will significantly increase its usability and effectiveness.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Unit/Context Completion Module:** This module should be triggered after the initial answer extraction. It should:\n    *   **Identify Potential Units:** Analyze the question and surrounding passage to identify potential units of measurement (e.g., \"years\", \"km\", \"$\").\n    *   **Contextual Keywords:**  Identify relevant keywords in the question and passage that provide context (e.g., \"age\", \"distance\", \"price\").\n    *   **Append Units/Context:**  Append the identified units and/or contextual keywords to the extracted answer if they are missing.  For example, if the extracted answer is \"38\" and the question asks about age, the module should transform the answer to \"38 years old\".  Use a similarity metric to find related context in the passage.\n2.  **Train on a Dataset with Negative Examples:** Create a dataset specifically designed to highlight the importance of complete answers. This dataset should include examples where the core information is correct, but the answer is marked as incorrect because it lacks units or context.\n3.  **Refine the ANSWER_START/ANSWER_END Tagging:**  While the tags are useful, consider adding a metadata section within the tags to explicitly identify the type of answer extracted (e.g., entity, numerical value, date). This will allow for more targeted post-processing.\n4.  **Experiment with Chain of Thought Prompting (if applicable):** If the system is based on a large language model, experiment with chain-of-thought prompting techniques to encourage it to justify its answer and provide more context.\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, it is difficult to determine a capability trend. While accuracy is high, the limited scope of the evaluation prevents a comprehensive assessment. To establish a trend, the system needs to be evaluated on a more diverse and challenging dataset, with specific attention paid to the identified weaknesses. Future evaluations should track metrics related to answer completeness and contextual understanding.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "Okay, I will perform a thorough forensic analysis of the provided successful problem-solving cases.\n\n## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo runtime errors were identified in the provided successful cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Numerical Extraction and Calculation:** The system demonstrates a strong ability to extract numerical values from the passage and perform simple arithmetic operations like addition (e.g., sample ID 3 and 9).\n2.  **Entity Recognition:** The system correctly identifies and extracts specific entities mentioned in the passage (e.g., players' names, city names), particularly when directly stated in the passage (e.g., sample IDs 1 and 8).\n3.  **Direct Answer Extraction:** The system can directly extract the answer from the passage when the question is straightforward and requires finding a specific piece of information.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Lack of Precise Unit Handling:** The system sometimes fails to include units in its answers, even when they are explicitly given in the golden answer (e.g., sample ID 2). While the core information is correct, the answer is incomplete.\n2.  **Dependence on Explicit Information:** The system's reasoning is often limited to directly extracting information presented in the passage. It does not demonstrate significant inferential reasoning or the ability to combine information from different parts of the passage to arrive at an answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Incomplete Answer Generation:** The system does not always include all relevant details in its answers (e.g., omitting units, failing to provide sufficient context).\n2.  **Limited Inferential Reasoning:** The system struggles with questions that require more than direct extraction and simple calculations.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe success cases lack error patterns as the system has answered all questions correctly.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to provide fully complete answers, which sometimes lack essential context, units, or modifiers that are present in the golden answer. While the extracted information is often accurate, the completeness of the response is not always guaranteed.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Answer Completeness:** Enhance the system's ability to provide comprehensive answers, including all relevant details and units mentioned in the passage.\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to consider context and infer implicit information when constructing its answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Post-processing of Answer:** Implement a post-processing step that checks the generated answer against the question and passage to ensure that all necessary units, modifiers, and contextual details are included.\n2.  **Contextual Awareness Module:** Introduce a module that specifically focuses on understanding the context of the question and passage to identify and incorporate implicit information into the answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nSince all samples were answered correctly, there were no capability failures.\n",

This suggests the dataset is not challenging enough or that the system is very strong in certain limited contexts.\n\n**PRIMARY ISSUE:** Incomplete answers, lacking essential context, units, or modifiers present in the source text. While extracted information is often accurate, the completeness of the response is not consistently guaranteed.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT AREAS:**\n\n1.  **Answer Completeness:** Improve the system's ability to provide comprehensive answers, including all relevant details and units mentioned in the passage.\n2.  **Contextual Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to consider context and infer implicit information when constructing its answers.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:**\n\n1.  **Post-processing of Answer:** Implement a post-processing step that checks the generated answer against the question and passage to ensure that all necessary units, modifiers, and contextual details are included.\n2.  **Contextual Awareness Module:** Introduce a module that specifically focuses on understanding the context of the question and passage to identify and incorporate implicit information into the answer.\n\n**CAPABILITY MAPPING:** No capability failures observed in the provided sample data.\n\n### SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS:\n\n```\n[\n  \"ANSWER_START\\nAbenakis\\n\\nANSWER_END\\n\",\n  \"ANSWER_START\\nSydney\\n\\nANSWER_END\\n\",\n  \"ANSWER_START\\n38\\n\\nANSWER_END\\n\"\n]\n```\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs demonstrate a consistent formatting convention (ANSWER_START / ANSWER_END tags), which is beneficial for parsing and downstream use.  However, the brevity of the answers reveals a potential for missing context.  For example, \"38\" might be a correct numerical answer, but without context (e.g., \"38 years old\", \"38 kilometers\"), it's incomplete.

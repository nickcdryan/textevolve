This time, components are isolated and tested separately.\n# We will test this approach and add verification steps to deduce if the changes are helpful.\n# This strategy is also aligned with the findings on structured questions and limited scope of constraints, letting us make assumptions that may speed up the process.\n# The script contains several functions, including decompose_problem, satisfy_constraints, match_schedules and generate_solution.\n# This approach will use multi-example prompting and incorporate validation loops throughout the process.\n\n# THIS IS KEY: The API error has been fixed.

  "approach_summary": "The script implements a \"decompose and conquer\" strategy for scheduling meetings, using the Gemini LLM to break down the problem, extract information, satisfy constraints, match schedules, and generate a solution. The script leverages functions such as `decompose_problem`, `satisfy_constraints`, `match_schedules`, `generate_solution`, and `extract_info`, each responsible for a specific sub-task and employing validation loops. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow, using `extract_info` to gather details, then orchestrating calls to the other functions to refine potential solutions until a result is generated. Each of the functions, like `decompose_problem` and `satisfy_constraints` make independent calls to the LLM to perform their respective jobs with iterative validation.",

    "error_analysis": {
      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error observed across all samples is:\n\n`module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'`\n\nThis error indicates a fundamental issue with the environment or setup of the `google.genai` library, which is likely used for interacting with the Gemini API.  This suggests that the library either isn't installed, is an older version that doesn't have the `configure` attribute, or that the environment isn't properly configured to access the API. This is preventing any of the LLM calls from functioning, cascading into a complete system failure.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the problem descriptions and the goal of the system, here are a few potential strengths (though the current errors prevent them from being demonstrated):\n\n1.  **Decomposition Approach (Potentially):** The error message \"Failed to decompose problem after multiple attempts\" *suggests* an attempt to break down the scheduling task into smaller, more manageable steps. This is a generally good strategy for complex problems.\n2.  **Constraint Awareness (Potentially):** The system attempts to extract constraints, as evidenced by the output \"Extracted constraints:\". If this extraction worked correctly, the system would be able to reason about constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Dependency on External API:** The reliance on `google.genai` and the Gemini API creates a critical point of failure. If the API is unavailable, misconfigured, or experiences changes, the entire system breaks down.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** While the system detects a decomposition failure, the handling is inadequate. The system simply returns a generic error message instead of attempting alternative strategies, providing more informative feedback, or gracefully handling API errors.\n3.  **Vulnerability to Setup Issues:** The system is highly vulnerable to environment setup issues.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Gemini API Configuration:** The inability to configure the `google.genai` library is the single most critical bottleneck. This prevents the entire system from functioning.\n2.  **Lack of Fallback Strategies:** The system lacks alternative solution paths when the primary approach (decomposition) fails.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is the `module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'` error. This indicates that the fundamental integration with the LLM API is broken. All errors stem directly from this issue. The attempt to decompose is likely a valid strategy, but the API failure prevents further progress.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the failure to properly configure or access the `google.genai` library, which prevents any communication with the Gemini API. This is a fatal flaw that prevents all other functionality from being tested.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **API Configuration:**  Fix the `google.genai` configuration issue. This may involve installing the correct version of the library, setting up authentication credentials, or resolving environment-specific issues.\n2.  **Robust Error Handling for API Calls:** Implement comprehensive error handling around all calls to the Gemini API. Catch specific exceptions (like `APIConnectionError`, `APIError`, `RateLimitError`) and handle them gracefully. This might involve retrying failed requests, switching to a different API endpoint, or providing informative error messages.\n3. **Implement Offline Debugging:** Add the ability to run the system in a debugging mode that substitutes dummy LLM responses for real API calls. This is critical for iterative development and debugging when the API is unavailable.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Verify `google.genai` Installation and Version:** Ensure the `google.genai` library is installed correctly and that the version is compatible with the code. Use `pip show google-generativeai` or a similar command to verify.\n2.  **Check API Credentials:** Confirm that the necessary API keys or credentials are set up correctly in the environment. The authentication setup depends on how the API is intended to be used.\n3.  **Implement a Wrapper Function for API Calls:** Create a function (e.g., `call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None)`) that handles all interactions with the Gemini API. This wrapper should include error handling, retry logic, and logging.\n4.  **Add Fallback Decomposition Strategies:** If the initial decomposition strategy fails, explore alternative decomposition methods or attempt to solve the problem directly without decomposition.\n5. **Add Logging and Detailed Error Messages:** Improve logging and provide more specific error messages to aid in debugging. Include details about the input, the failing component, and the exception that was raised.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nAll samples failed due to the same root cause: the `google.genai` configuration error.

Every output is dominated by the error message: `module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'`. This indicates that the system is unable to initialize its connection to the Gemini API, rendering all subsequent steps useless.

However, based on the design, here are some potential strengths to maintain once the API issue is resolved:\n\n1.  **Structured Problem Decomposition:** The system attempts to break down the scheduling task.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error observed across all samples is:\n\n`module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'`\n\nThis error indicates a fundamental issue with the environment or setup of the `google.genai` library, which is likely used for interacting with the Gemini API.  This suggests that the library either isn't installed, is an older version that doesn't have the `configure` attribute, or that the environment isn't properly configured to access the API. This is preventing any of the LLM calls from functioning, cascading into a complete system failure.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the problem descriptions and the goal of the system, here are a few potential strengths (though the current errors prevent them from being demonstrated):\n\n1.  **Decomposition Approach (Potentially):** The error message \"Failed to decompose problem after multiple attempts\" *suggests* an attempt to break down the scheduling task into smaller, more manageable steps. This is a generally good strategy for complex problems.\n2.  **Constraint Awareness (Potentially):** The system attempts to extract constraints, as evidenced by the output \"Extracted constraints:\". If this extraction worked correctly, the system would be able to reason about constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Dependency on External API:** The reliance on `google.genai` and the Gemini API creates a critical point of failure. If the API is unavailable, misconfigured, or experiences changes, the entire system breaks down.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** While the system detects a decomposition failure, the handling is inadequate. The system simply returns a generic error message instead of attempting alternative strategies, providing more informative feedback, or gracefully handling API errors.\n3.  **Vulnerability to Setup Issues:** The system is highly vulnerable to environment setup issues.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Gemini API Configuration:** The inability to configure the `google.genai` library is the single most critical bottleneck. This prevents the entire system from functioning.\n2.  **Lack of Fallback Strategies:** The system lacks alternative solution paths when the primary approach (decomposition) fails.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is the `module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'` error. This indicates that the fundamental integration with the LLM API is broken. All errors stem directly from this issue. The attempt to decompose is likely a valid strategy, but the API failure prevents further progress.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the failure to properly configure or access the `google.genai` library, which prevents any communication with the Gemini API. This is a fatal flaw that prevents all other functionality from being tested.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **API Configuration:**  Fix the `google.genai` configuration issue. This may involve installing the correct version of the library, setting up authentication credentials, or resolving environment-specific issues.\n2.  **Robust Error Handling for API Calls:** Implement comprehensive error handling around all calls to the Gemini API. Catch specific exceptions (like `APIConnectionError`, `APIError`, `RateLimitError`) and handle them gracefully. This might involve retrying failed requests, switching to a different API endpoint, or providing informative error messages.\n3. **Implement Offline Debugging:** Add the ability to run the system in a debugging mode that substitutes dummy LLM responses for real API calls.

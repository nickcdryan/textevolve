  "approach_summary": "The script uses a ReAct agent (`schedule_react_agent`) to solve meeting scheduling problems by iteratively reasoning and acting, using the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini LLM. The `schedule_react_agent` parses constraints, finds available slots, and verifies solutions within a set number of iterations, returning a proposed meeting time. The `main` function serves as an entry point, calling the `schedule_react_agent` with the input question to find a suitable time. The `call_llm` function takes a prompt and system instruction to call the Gemini LLM and return the generated output.",

This points to a flaw in the logic that combines individual schedules to find a common free slot.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is an inaccurate constraint handling mechanism. The system does not reliably cross-reference the provided schedule data for all participants to identify mutually available time slots within the given work hours. This likely stems from either incorrect extraction of available times or faulty logic when checking proposed times against the schedules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The most crucial area for improvement is the system's ability to identify and respect scheduling constraints for multiple participants.\n*   **Information Extraction:** Ensure that all scheduling information is correctly extracted, parsed, and represented in a format that facilitates accurate conflict detection.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Implement a robust verification step to check the proposed meeting time against each participant's schedule to ensure it's conflict-free.\n*   **Decision Making:** Add some mechanism to sort available times and choose the \"earliest\".\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n*   **Implement a structured data representation for schedules:** Instead of processing schedules as free-form text, convert the schedule information into a structured format (e.g., a list of blocked time intervals for each participant) immediately after extraction. This will enable easier programmatic manipulation and conflict detection.\n*   **Develop a conflict-detection algorithm:** Implement a dedicated algorithm to check whether a proposed meeting time conflicts with any participant's blocked schedule intervals.\n*   **Introduce a verification step with negative constraints:** Before suggesting a meeting time, verify that it *doesn't* fall within any participant's blocked time intervals. This will serve as a double-check and help catch errors.\n*   **Refine the prompt for LLM:** Use few-shot examples and clarify the required output format (e.g., start and end time) to avoid time parsing errors. Provide example blocked times and how to properly exclude them from potential times.\n*   **Hybrid Approach:** Implement a function that programmatically iterates through time slots and excludes those that are taken by any participant. Then have the LLM present that result back to the user in a readable format.\n*   **Improve LLM extraction prompt**: Add instructions to return an explicit list of available slots.

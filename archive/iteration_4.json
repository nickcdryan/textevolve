  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by decomposing the task into extraction, hypothesis generation, and application. It employs LLMs for each of these steps, using specific prompts and system instructions to guide the LLM's behavior in each role. The `extract_grid_info` function extracts structured data, `hypothesize_transformation` generates transformation hypotheses, and `apply_hypothesis` applies the first hypothesis to the test input; all of these functions use the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model. The `main` function orchestrates the overall workflow by calling these functions sequentially and handling potential errors.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of grid-based input/output and the ability to generate simple hypotheses about grid transformations. However, it fails to consistently generate correct hypotheses, accurately apply them, and manage computational complexity, resulting in a very low accuracy rate. The system shows promise in pattern recognition, but this capacity is not being effectively translated into reliable performance.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Hypothesis Generation (Rudimentary):**  The system *attempts* to identify patterns and formulate hypotheses, which is a foundational capability.\n*   **Grid Processing:** Can process grid-based input and output in JSON format.\n*   **Rule Application (Attempts):** The system attempts to translate generated hypotheses into explicit steps for grid transformation.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Hypothesis Accuracy:** Generates incorrect or irrelevant hypotheses for grid transformations.\n*   **Hypothesis Verification:** Lacks a mechanism to validate hypotheses before application.\n*   **Application Errors:**  Makes errors in translating hypotheses into concrete grid transformations (inaccurate execution of transformation rules).\n*   **Computational Efficiency:** Suffers from timeout errors due to inefficient code.\n*   **Output Size Management:** Fails to produce outputs of the correct dimensions.\n*    **Limited Generalization:** Current rule application is very rigid and unable to manage unforeseen examples.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Hypothesis Accuracy and Verification**.  Accurate hypotheses are the foundation for correct solutions. Without them, even flawless execution is meaningless. Implementing a mechanism to verify hypotheses BEFORE applying them will prevent the system from wasting time and resources on incorrect paths.\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (Timeout):** The \"Script execution timed out (60 seconds)\" error indicates a significant performance bottleneck. This could be caused by an infinite loop, inefficient algorithms, or excessively complex computations. The system fails to produce any output.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The generated hypothesis is entirely disconnected from the example grid transformations. The system incorrectly identifies a pattern related to row insertion and duplication. The system creates rows of \"8\" when it does not need to, and adds the incorrect amount of rows to the final output.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system failed to produce a non-error output for this test. We can likely assume it followed the same pattern as Sample ID 1, as that pattern was not specific to a single input.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Hypothesis Verification:**\n    *   **Training Set Validation:** Before applying a hypothesis to the test input, apply it to the training inputs.  Calculate the percentage of training examples for which the hypothesis produces the correct output.\n    *   **Accuracy Threshold:** Set an accuracy threshold (e.g., 80%). If the hypothesis's accuracy on the training set is below the threshold, discard it and try a different hypothesis generation strategy.\n    *   **Consider Partial Matches:** Allow partial credit or weighting for hypotheses that correctly transform *some* elements or regions of the grid, rather than requiring perfect matches.\n2.  **Refine Pattern Recognition and Feature Extraction:**\n    *   **Feature-Based Hypotheses:** Move beyond simple row/column-based patterns. Implement feature extraction (e.g., identifying specific number arrangements, shapes, or lines within the grid). Hypotheses should be based on these features.\n    *   **Spatial Relationship Analysis:** Add logic to analyze the spatial relationships between features.  For example, \"If number 'X' is in the top-left corner, then number 'Y' is always in the bottom-right corner.\"\n    *   **Implement Symmetry Detection:** A common pattern in grid problems is symmetry. Implement a symmetry detection module and include symmetry as a potential element in the hypotheses.\n3.  **Optimize Code Execution:**\n    *   **Profiling:** Use a code profiler to identify the most time-consuming sections of the grid transformation code.\n    *   **Algorithm Optimization:** Review the algorithms used for grid manipulation.  Look for opportunities to reduce computational complexity (e.g., avoiding unnecessary loops or redundant calculations).\n    *   **Early Exit Conditions:** Add early exit conditions to loops or recursive functions. For example, if the system detects that the hypothesis is leading to an invalid state (e.g., an infinite loop), it should terminate the execution.\n4.  **Improve Output Size Management:**\n    *   **Output Size Prediction:** Attempt to predict the size of the output grid based on the training examples and the generated hypothesis. Enforce constraints on the output size to match the expected dimensions.\n    *   **Padding/Truncation:** If the transformed grid is larger than the expected output size, implement a padding or truncation strategy to ensure the output conforms to the required dimensions.\n5.  **Detailed Logging/Debugging:**\n    *   **Extensive Logging:** Add detailed logging statements to track the execution of the system, including the generated hypotheses, the transformations applied, and the intermediate grid states. This will help identify the source of errors.\n\n**CAPABILITY MAPPING (Updated):**\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: **Failed** (Timeout)\n    *   solution\\_generation: **Failed** (Timeout)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: **Partial** (Identified some, but incorrect, patterns)\n    *   solution\\_generation: **Failed** (Incorrect solution)\n    *   solution\\_verification: **Failed** (No verification)\n    *   decision\\_making: **Failed** (Based on flawed hypothesis)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: **Partial** (Likely followed Sample ID 1's pattern)\n    *   solution\\_generation: **Failed** (Incorrect solution)\n    *   solution\\_verification: **Failed** (No verification)\n    *   decision\\_making: **Failed** (Based on flawed hypothesis)\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **Stable (Very Low)**.  The system consistently fails, but demonstrates rudimentary abilities. Improvements in hypothesis generation and verification are crucial for seeing any positive trend.  Without these core improvements, any further development will be built on a faulty foundation. Significant improvement is expected following the implementation of the above recommendations, assuming proper testing.\n",

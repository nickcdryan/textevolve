  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by extracting constraints from a question, proposing a meeting time, and verifying the solution using LLMs. It uses a chain-of-thought approach with few-shot examples in prompts to guide the LLM's reasoning. The main agent roles are: constraint extractor, time proposer, and solution verifier, implemented as functions that call the `call_llm` function, which acts as a simple interface to the Gemini API. The workflow involves `extract_meeting_constraints` to get constraints, `propose_meeting_time` to find a time, and `verify_solution` to check validity, with the `main` function orchestrating the process.",

The system should be able to select the \"best\" solution considering a wider range of factors, potentially including minimizing the total inconvenience for all participants.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Cost Function:** Develop a cost function that quantifies the \"inconvenience\" of a meeting time for each participant (e.g., based on proximity to existing meetings, expressed preferences, etc.). The system should then aim to minimize the total cost across all participants.\n\n2.  **Introduce Optimization Step:** After identifying all feasible meeting times, add an optimization step where the system evaluates each candidate solution based on the cost function and selects the one with the lowest total cost.\n3.  **Develop conflict resolution strategy**: Develop a strategy to handle meeting planning in which at least one party needs to have some level of inconvenience. This could either involve providing several potential solutions that might arise depending on whether one individual gets their wishes met over another, or some other strategy that would meet these requirements.\n4.  **Strengthen Reasoning for Solution Selection**: The logic and reasoning for why the final solution was selected over alternative possible solutions needs to be more fleshed out.\n5.  **Handle No Solution scenarios**: Develop code that can determine scenarios in which no meeting time is possible without someone's preferences needing to be ignored.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the perfect accuracy score and lack of errors, the system's capability appears to be **stable at a high level.** However, the recommendations above are aimed at pushing the system beyond its current capabilities and addressing potential limitations.\n",

The system's ability to articulate the reasoning process is also commendable.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accurate Constraint Parsing:** The system accurately identifies and interprets scheduling constraints from the input text.\n*   **Logical Reasoning:** The system uses clear and logical reasoning to deduce suitable meeting times based on the parsed constraints.\n*   **Comprehensive Search:** The system appears to comprehensively search for valid meeting times, considering the schedules of all participants.\n*   **Clear Articulation:** The system effectively communicates the reasoning behind its proposed solution, enhancing transparency.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Limited Constraint Complexity:** While the system handles basic constraints well, it might struggle with more complex constraints, such as tiered preferences, dependencies between participants, or resource limitations.\n*   **Limited Optimization:** The system finds *a* valid solution, but doesn't necessarily optimize for the *best* solution (e.g., minimizing the disruption to everyone's schedule). The system is not able to handle scenarios in which no solution is possible without someone having to be inconvenienced.\n*   **Black Box Determination of Best Solution**: While the AI system is identifying what the best solution is, there is not clear reasoning to show why that particular solution is the best solution.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **optimization of the proposed solution**. The system should be able to select the \"best\" solution considering a wider range of factors, potentially including minimizing the total inconvenience for all participants.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Cost Function:** Develop a cost function that quantifies the \"inconvenience\" of a meeting time for each participant (e.g., based on proximity to existing meetings, expressed preferences, etc.). The system should then aim to minimize the total cost across all participants.\n\n2.  **Introduce Optimization Step:** After identifying all feasible meeting times, add an optimization step where the system evaluates each candidate solution based on the cost function and selects the one with the lowest total cost.\n3.  **Develop conflict resolution strategy**: Develop a strategy to handle meeting planning in which at least one party needs to have some level of inconvenience. This could either involve providing several potential solutions that might arise depending on whether one individual gets their wishes met over another, or some other strategy that would meet these requirements.\n4.  **Strengthen Reasoning for Solution Selection**: The logic and reasoning for why the final solution was selected over alternative possible solutions needs to be more fleshed out.\n5.  **Handle No Solution scenarios**: Develop code that can determine scenarios in which no meeting time is possible without someone's preferences needing to be ignored.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the perfect accuracy score and lack of errors, the system's capability appears to be **stable at a high level.** However, the recommendations above are aimed at pushing the system beyond its current capabilities and addressing potential limitations.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script employs a multi-stage, LLM-driven approach to answer questions by identifying the question type and keywords, extracting a relevant passage from the given text, generating an answer based on the extracted passage, and then verifying the answer for correctness. It decomposes the problem into four distinct stages, each handled by a specific function acting as an agent. The functions involved are `main` which orchestrates the process, `analyze_question` which determines the question type and keywords, `extract_relevant_passage` which retrieves pertinent text, `generate_answer` which formulates the answer, `verify_answer` which checks the answer, and `call_llm` which interfaces with the Gemini LLM. The workflow begins with `main` calling `analyze_question`, followed by `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and finally `verify_answer`, with each function passing its output as input to the next, using `call_llm` to interact with the LLM in each step.",

Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Following a shocking loss to the 3-7 Kansas City Chiefs the previous week, the Steelers traveled to M&T Bank Stadium for another divisional game. Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game.

      "original_passage": "Following a shocking loss to the 3-7 Kansas City Chiefs the previous week, the Steelers traveled to M&T Bank Stadium for another divisional game. Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game. With their second consecutive overtime loss, the Steelers fell to 6-5.",

Pittsburgh would strike first in the first quarter with kicker Jeff Reed's 19-yard field goal and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's 27-yard touchdown pass to running back Willie Parker.  The Steelers would add onto their lead in the second quarter as Reed made a 34-yard field goal.  The Bengals would close out the half with kicker Shayne Graham's 34-yard field goal. Cincinnati would creep closer in the third quarter as cornerback Johnathan Joseph returned an interception 30&#160;yards for a touchdown (with a failed PAT), yet Pittsburgh answered with Roethlisberger's 1-yard touchdown run.  However, in the fourth quarter, the Bengals took the lead with running back Cedric Benson's 23-yard touchdown run (with a failed 2-point conversion) and quarterback Carson Palmer's 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Andre Caldwell (with a successful 2-point conversion pass to running back Brian Leonard).  The Steelers tried to rally, but Roethlisberger's last-second hail mary pass was incomplete, preserving the defeat. With the loss, Pittsburgh fell to 1-2 and 3rd place in the AFC North.  This would also become the team's first 1-2 start since 2006. Wide receiver Hines Ward (4 receptions, 82&#160;yards) would become the 21st player in NFL history to surpass 800 career receptions and 10,000 receiving yards.",

This is evident in the success cases where it correctly identifies and extracts the necessary information to answer the questions (e.g., identifying player names, quantities of yards, etc.).\n*   **Simple Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system can perform simple arithmetic operations, such as subtraction, when the necessary information is explicitly present in the passage. Sample ID 5 in the success cases demonstrates this capability.\n*   **Direct Answer Identification:** In many cases, the system is capable of correctly identifying and extracting the answer when it is directly stated within the passage. This is shown across the success cases, such as identifying who had the longest touchdown reception in Sample ID 8.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n*   **Complex Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system struggles with questions that require more complex arithmetic reasoning, such as calculating the difference between two scores when those scores are not directly given in the passage. This is highlighted in Error Case 7, where the system fails to determine the final scores and compute the point difference.\n*   **Inability to Track Multiple Events:** The system demonstrates difficulty in tracking multiple scoring events throughout the passage and aggregating them into a final score for each team.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Lack of Score Tracking/Aggregation:** The inability to track and aggregate multiple scoring events (touchdowns, field goals, etc.) from the passage to calculate team scores.\n*   **Limited Arithmetic Deduction:** Inability to perform simple arithmetic reasoning when the information is distributed throughout the text and requires multiple steps to derive the answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   The primary error pattern is the inability to synthesize information spread across the text to derive a numerical answer, especially when the answer requires arithmetic calculations or score tracking.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the system's inability to track and calculate the final scores of teams based on individual scoring plays described in the passage. This stems from a limitation in complex arithmetic reasoning and score aggregation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Complex Arithmetic Reasoning:** Improve the ability to perform arithmetic calculations that involve combining information from different parts of the passage.\n*   **Score Tracking Capability:** Implement a mechanism for tracking and updating team scores based on the game events described in the passage.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a Score Tracking Module:** Design a module that can parse the passage for scoring plays (touchdowns, field goals, etc.), assign points to the appropriate team, and maintain a running tally of each team's score. This module should be capable of handling various ways scoring plays are described (e.g., \"a 7-yard TD run,\" \"a 30-yard field goal\").\n2.  **Enhance Arithmetic Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to perform arithmetic calculations. For example, after extracting all scoring plays, the system should be able to sum the scores to find the total or subtract scores to find the difference. Introduce intermediate variables to hold each team's score and make them accessible for calculations.\n3.  **Break Down Question into Sub-Questions:** Before answering the main question, have the system identify sub-questions to answer. For example, if the question is \"How many more points did the Ravens score than the Steelers?\", the sub-questions are \"What was the Ravens' final score?\" and \"What was the Steelers' final score?\". By breaking the problem down, the system is more likely to solve the problem correctly.\n4. Add more print statements or intermediate outputs to provide a step-by-step analysis of the system's reasoning when it tries to compute the score.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 7:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracted some scoring plays but not all or didn't associate them with teams)\n    *   constraint_handling: N/A\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (could not generate final scores)\n    *   solution_verification: N/A\n    *   decision_making: Incorrect (stated not enough information)\n",

The outputs are clean and adhere to the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` format. However, without the questions corresponding to these outputs, it's difficult to assess the *correctness* of the answers beyond the information that they are extracting information. The lack of diversity in the output format suggests the system might be relying on simple pattern matching or direct extraction, which aligns with the weaknesses identified in the error analysis. There is no obvious reason to assume issues given the information, however it is impossible to be sure.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system possesses a baseline capability for information extraction and direct answer identification from text. It struggles with tasks that require arithmetic reasoning, information synthesis, and tracking events to arrive at a numerical answer. The system correctly answers 9/10 questions, and demonstrates an ability to extract information such as player names, quantities of yards, and named entities, but struggles when the answer requires more complex mathmatical reasoning. The system could benefit from the incorporation of new modules to track scores and synthesize information throughout the text.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Direct Information Extraction:** The system excels at identifying and extracting answers explicitly stated in the passage. This is a foundational capability that can be leveraged.\n*   **Numerical Value Identification:** The system can identify and extract numerical values, a core requirement for tasks involving arithmetic.\n*   **Named Entity Recognition:** The system demonstrates the capability to recognize Named Entities, such as players, teams, and cities.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Complex Arithmetic Reasoning & Calculation:** This is the most significant weakness, as the system struggles to perform calculations when the numbers are not directly presented in the answer.\n*   **Score Tracking & Aggregation:** The inability to track and update team scores dynamically is a critical limitation.\n*   **Information Synthesis:** The system cannot combine information from across the text to derive the answer.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **Complex Arithmetic Reasoning and Score Tracking/Aggregation**. Addressing this will unlock the system's ability to answer a broader range of questions and handle more complex scenarios.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nBased on the error analysis and improvement suggestions, here's a set of specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement the Score Tracking Module:** Prioritize the development of a module that can parse the passage for scoring plays, associate points with teams, and maintain a running tally. This requires robust parsing and entity recognition.\n2.  **Enhance Arithmetic Reasoning with Intermediate Variables:** Modify the system to use intermediate variables to store team scores.  After extracting scoring plays, use these variables to accumulate the scores. This promotes modularity and clarity in the calculation process.\n3.  **Implement a \"Question Decomposition\" Pre-processing Step:**  Before attempting to answer the main question, have the system identify and answer sub-questions first. For example, for a question about the score difference, the sub-questions would be: \"What was Team A's final score?\" and \"What was Team B's final score?\". Store these intermediate answers.\n4.  **Introduce Detailed Logging and Intermediate Outputs:** Add print statements (or logging) at each stage of the score tracking and calculation process. This will allow for easier debugging and identification of specific points of failure. For example, log each extracted scoring play, the updated team scores, and the final calculated difference.\n5. **Test-Driven Development:** Establish a suite of test cases that explicitly test the scoring tracking and complex reasoning capabilities. These tests should include scenarios with multiple scoring plays, different types of scoring (TDs, field goals), and questions that require calculating score differences.\n\n**Example Implementation Steps for Score Tracking Module:**\n\n*   **Scoring Play Detection:** Use regular expressions or pattern matching to identify phrases indicating scoring plays (e.g., \"a 7-yard TD run,\" \"a 30-yard field goal\").\n*   **Team Association:** Implement logic to associate the scoring play with the correct team.  This might involve looking for team names mentioned near the scoring play.\n*   **Point Assignment:**  Assign the correct number of points based on the type of score (e.g., 6 points for a touchdown, 3 points for a field goal).\n*   **Score Update:** Update the team scores using intermediate variables.\n*   **Use more advanced models to better recognize and infer scores, like transformers.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the provided information, the capability trend is currently **stable but limited**. The system performs well on simple tasks but lacks the advanced reasoning capabilities needed for more complex scenarios. The proposed improvements are expected to lead to a significant **improvement** in the system's overall capabilities.\n",

This stems from a limitation in complex arithmetic reasoning and score aggregation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Complex Arithmetic Reasoning:** Improve the ability to perform arithmetic calculations that involve combining information from different parts of the passage.\n*   **Score Tracking Capability:** Implement a mechanism for tracking and updating team scores based on the game events described in the passage.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a Score Tracking Module:** Design a module that can parse the passage for scoring plays (touchdowns, field goals, etc.), assign points to the appropriate team, and maintain a running tally of each team's score. This module should be capable of handling various ways scoring plays are described (e.g., \"a 7-yard TD run,\" \"a 30-yard field goal\").\n2.  **Enhance Arithmetic Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to perform arithmetic calculations. For example, after extracting all scoring plays, the system should be able to sum the scores to find the total or subtract scores to find the difference. Introduce intermediate variables to hold each team's score and make them accessible for calculations.\n3.  **Break Down Question into Sub-Questions:** Before answering the main question, have the system identify sub-questions to answer. For example, if the question is \"How many more points did the Ravens score than the Steelers?\", the sub-questions are \"What was the Ravens' final score?\" and \"What was the Steelers' final score?\". By breaking the problem down, the system is more likely to solve the problem correctly.\n4. Add more print statements or intermediate outputs to provide a step-by-step analysis of the system's reasoning when it tries to compute the score.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 7:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (extracted some scoring plays but not all or didn't associate them with teams)\n    *   constraint_handling: N/A\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (could not generate final scores)\n    *   solution_verification: N/A\n    *   decision_making: Incorrect (stated not enough information)\n",

The outputs are clean and adhere to the `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` format. However, without the questions corresponding to these outputs, it's difficult to assess the *correctness* of the answers beyond the information that they are extracting information. The lack of diversity in the output format suggests the system might be relying on simple pattern matching or direct extraction, which aligns with the weaknesses identified in the error analysis. There is no obvious reason to assume issues given the information, however it is impossible to be sure.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system possesses a baseline capability for information extraction and direct answer identification from text.

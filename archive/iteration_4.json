  "approach_summary": "The script uses a decompose-and-generate approach to answer questions by classifying the question type, extracting relevant information, and then generating the final answer using the Gemini LLM. It uses in-context learning with examples to guide the LLM in each step. There are three distinct agent roles: a question type classifier, an information extractor, and an answer generator.\n\nThe `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, and `generate_answer` sequentially; these functions formulate specific prompts for the LLM. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini LLM, sending prompts and receiving responses.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Frederick had been King of Jerusalem\u2014and as such claimed suzerainty over Cyprus\u2014in right of his wife Isabella II until her death in 1228. That year he arrived first in Cyprus, where he antagonised the nobles, and then in Jerusalem, where he stayed until 1229, leaving in humiliating circumstances after having produced an anti-imperialist reaction in the people. In 1231 he sent Riccardo Filangieri as his marshal. His attempt to assert his authority was opposed by John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, who had been regent until Frederick's arrival. On John's death in 1236 the war was taken up by his son Balian. In 1239 Philip of Montfort assumed the leadership of the opposition. Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. He also held the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, which had been negotiated away from the Saracens by Frederick. So long as the Ibelins controlled the opposition, Filangieri could count on the support of their enemies as well. The Italian cities were also divided between the two factions: Pisa supported Filangieri and Genoa the Ibelins. The Ibelins controlled Beirut, Arsuf, and Caesarea as well as the old capital of Acre. In 1231 the citizens of Acre formed a commune with their headquarters at the church of Saint Andrew's in order to unify their opposition to Filangieri. In 1232 John of Ibelin was elected its mayor.\n\nQUESTION: Who died first John of Ibelin or Isabella II?",

That year he arrived first in Cyprus, where he antagonised the nobles, and then in Jerusalem, where he stayed until 1229, leaving in humiliating circumstances after having produced an anti-imperialist reaction in the people. In 1231 he sent Riccardo Filangieri as his marshal. His attempt to assert his authority was opposed by John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, who had been regent until Frederick's arrival. On John's death in 1236 the war was taken up by his son Balian. In 1239 Philip of Montfort assumed the leadership of the opposition. Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. He also held the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, which had been negotiated away from the Saracens by Frederick. So long as the Ibelins controlled the opposition, Filangieri could count on the support of their enemies as well. The Italian cities were also divided between the two factions: Pisa supported Filangieri and Genoa the Ibelins. The Ibelins controlled Beirut, Arsuf, and Caesarea as well as the old capital of Acre. In 1231 the citizens of Acre formed a commune with their headquarters at the church of Saint Andrew's in order to unify their opposition to Filangieri. In 1232 John of Ibelin was elected its mayor.",

The first serious attempt of the Ottoman government to suppress the revolt resulted with the Battle of De\u00e7iq. Terenzio Tocci gathered the Mirdite chieftains on 26 April 1911 in Orosh, proclaimed the independence of Albania, raised the flag of Albania  and established the provisional government. Shefqet Turgut Pasha wanted to meet this threat and returned to the region with 8.000 soldiers. As soon as he reached Shkod\u00ebr on 11 May, he issued a general proclamation which declared martial law and offered an amnesty for all rebels  if they immediately return to their homes. After Ottoman troops entered the area Tocci fled the empire abandoning his activities. On 14 May, three days after his poclamation, Shefqet Turgut Pasha ordered his troops to seize De\u010di\u0107, hill that overlooked Tuzi. Sixty Albanian chieftains rejected Turgut Pasha's proclamation on their meeting in Podgorica on 18 May. After almost a month of intense fightings rebels were trapped and their only choices were either to die fighting, to surrender or to flee to Montenegro. Most of the rebels chose to flee to Montenegro which became a base for large number of rebels determined to attack the Ottoman Empire. Ismail Kemal Bey and Tiranli Cemal bey traveled from Italy to Montenegro at the end of May and met the rebels to convince them to adopt the nationalistic agenda which they eventually did.

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive assessment of the AI system based on its performance data. It outlines strengths, weaknesses, critical bottlenecks, and offers actionable recommendations for improvement.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs reveal the following:\n\n*   **Varied Output Formats:** The format \"ANSWER\\_START\\\\n...\\\\n\\\\nANSWER\\_END\\\\n\" is consistently used, which is positive for post-processing and result extraction.\n*   **Arithmetic Capability Visible:** One output shows a simple subtraction operation (37 - 24 = 13 points), confirming the arithmetic ability.\n*   **Contextual Answers:** One answer (\"Married couples living together\") suggests the system can extract relevant phrases from the context.\n*   **Lack of Detailed Reasoning:** While the answers are provided, there's no insight into the system's reasoning process. This makes debugging difficult.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates moderate question-answering capabilities, particularly in information extraction and basic arithmetic. However, it struggles with complex reasoning, especially temporal reasoning and understanding relationships between entities. The system shows consistency in output formatting, which aids in post-processing. Overall, the system is operating at a level capable of answering simple, fact-based questions directly from the text.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system's ability to identify and extract relevant information from the passage is a key strength. It can pinpoint specific phrases or entities needed for the answer.\n*   **Basic Arithmetic:**  The system demonstrates competency in performing simple arithmetic operations to derive answers.\n*   **Consistent Output Formatting:** The consistent use of \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END\" tags simplifies result parsing.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Temporal Reasoning:**  The system consistently fails when questions require precise temporal calculations or reasoning about time differences. This is highlighted in the error analysis and remains a critical weakness.\n*   **Relationship Extraction:** The system struggles to understand and represent the relationships between entities in the passage. This impacts its ability to answer questions that require nuanced understanding of context.\n*   **Lack of Transparency in Reasoning:** The system's lack of transparency in its reasoning process makes it difficult to identify the root cause of errors and hinders targeted debugging.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Temporal Reasoning**. Addressing this bottleneck will significantly enhance the system's ability to handle a wider range of questions and improve its overall accuracy. The error analysis clearly identifies this as the primary area for improvement.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Date Parsing and Calculation Module:** Prioritize the integration of a dedicated module for date parsing and calculation.  Use libraries like `dateutil` or `arrow` in Python for robust date handling. Ensure the module can handle various date formats present in the text. The module should expose functions for:\n    *   Extracting all date-like strings from the text.\n    *   Parsing each string into a canonical date object.\n    *   Calculating the difference between two date objects in months, days, and years.\n2.  **Implement Step-by-Step Temporal Reasoning Debugging:** When the system encounters a temporal question, force it to:\n    *   Identify the relevant dates in the passage.\n    *   Output the parsed dates in a standardized format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).\n    *   Show the calculation performed to determine the time difference.\n    *   Output the final answer with units (e.g., \"12 months\").\n    This intermediate output will help pinpoint whether the error lies in date extraction, parsing, or the calculation itself.\n3.  **Curate a Temporal Reasoning Training Dataset:**  Create a dataset specifically designed to improve temporal reasoning. This dataset should include passages with various date formats and questions that require calculating time differences, determining temporal order, and reasoning about events happening before or after specific dates.  Use this dataset to fine-tune the model.\n4. **Prioritize Error Case 1 and 2 in Retraining:** Ensure Error Case 1 (temporal reasoning) and Error Case 2 (relationship understanding) are addressed with targeted retraining data and modified architecture (as suggested above).\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the error analysis and execution outputs, the system's capabilities are currently **stable with room to grow with improvement focus**. The system demonstrates consistent performance within its current capabilities, but the identified weaknesses are significant enough to warrant immediate attention. Implementing the recommendations should lead to a positive capability trend.\n",

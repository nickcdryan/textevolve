  "approach_summary": "The script implements a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to answer questions using an LLM. It decomposes the problem into query generation, search snippet validation, and answer generation. The `generate_query_and_validate` function uses an LLM with the \"expert at generating effective search queries\" role to create a search query and then validates the query using another LLM call with the role \"expert at validating search snippets\" before proceeding; It uses a few-shot validation technique. The `generate_answer_with_snippets` function uses an LLM with the role \"expert at answering questions given relevant search snippets\" to formulate an answer based on the validated search snippets.\n\nThe overall workflow begins in `main` which calls `generate_query_and_validate` with a question, which in turn uses `call_llm` to generate a search query and validate the results. `main` then calls `generate_answer_with_snippets` with the original question and the validated search snippets, which in turn uses `call_llm` to generate the final answer. The `call_llm` function is used throughout the script to interface with the Gemini LLM for query generation, snippet validation, and answer generation.",

Specifically in the first error case, it fails to find the losses of Adolf Anderssen in his 1864 chess match against Berthold Suhle.\n*   **Inability to Handle Negations/Absence of Information:** The system struggles to differentiate between \"information not present\" and a definitive answer (e.g., the answer is zero). It returns \"Information...not present\" when it needs to be able to use an LLM to extract the correct answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Poor Information Retrieval:** The inability to retrieve relevant information from search snippets is the biggest bottleneck. The system needs more robust techniques for searching and identifying the correct information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   The primary error pattern is the system stating information is not present in search snippets when it is likely present but not being effectively extracted or found.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe single most critical problem is the **inadequate retrieval of relevant information from search snippets**. The search queries and information extraction methods used by the system are not specific or robust enough to find the required details, leading to \"information not present\" answers even when the information is potentially available.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Significantly improve the system's ability to find and extract relevant information from search snippets. This includes refining search queries and improving the text parsing/extraction methods.\n*   **Knowledge Generation:** The system should try to derive a reasonable answer from the available information or from pre-existing knowledge before defaulting to \"information not present\". If an exact answer cannot be found, a best estimate or range should be considered.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Refine Search Queries:** Implement more sophisticated search query generation techniques. Use techniques like keyword expansion, query relaxation, and query reformulation to broaden and refine the search. For example, include variations of the entity name, and related terms.\n2.  **Improve Snippet Parsing:** Improve how the system parses and understands the meaning of search snippets. The system should leverage more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information even if it's not explicitly stated in a simple format. Specifically, look for mentions of \"losses\" when \"chess match\" and the two players names appear in the same snippet.\n3.  **Implement Multi-Hop Reasoning:** The system should be capable of performing multi-hop reasoning to synthesize information from multiple snippets or sources. It needs to link pieces of information together to answer complex questions.\n4.  **Integrate External Knowledge:** Supplement the search snippet information with external knowledge sources (e.g., a chess database) to help answer questions when information retrieval is limited. This will help if the precise match records are not returned via a simple search.\n5. **Implement Intermediate Output Logging:** Add print statements to log intermediate steps, especially the search queries, retrieved snippets, and extracted information before the answer generation step. This allows for retrospective debugging.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction failed, decision_making failed. The system incorrectly determined that the information was not present.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System Assessment\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Overall Pattern:** The system demonstrates partial success in information extraction and answering but falters significantly when precise information retrieval is required or when dealing with potentially incomplete information. The \"Information not present\" response is a recurring issue, even when the information seems retrievable with more robust techniques.\n*   **Successful Examples:** The first two examples showcase accurate information extraction and answer generation when the relevant information is readily available in the retrieved snippets.\n*   **Failure Analysis:** The third example clearly demonstrates the critical weakness. The system fails to identify and extract the number of losses from the search snippets, defaulting to a canned \"Information not present\" response. The prompt directs the system to use an LLM to try to extract a correct answer.\n*   **Intermediate Logging Needed:** Without intermediate logging (search queries, retrieved snippets), it's impossible to pinpoint *exactly* where the failure occurs. Is the *correct* snippet not being retrieved? Is the snippet being retrieved, but the relevant information is not being extracted? The \"Information not present\" answer does not help in debugging.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system has a moderate level of capability in question answering when the required information is directly and easily accessible. However, its ability to handle more complex queries, especially those requiring nuanced information retrieval or inference, is limited. The system demonstrates a significant reliance on explicit information presence in search snippets and lacks the ability to intelligently reason or leverage external knowledge to compensate for incomplete information.\n\n* **Accuracy:** Demonstrates roughly 67% accuracy based on the provided data. This indicates a significant room for improvement.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction and Answer Generation:** The system can accurately extract and present information when it is readily available and easily identifiable in the retrieved snippets.\n*   **Partial Information Extraction:** The system can extract key information like names and dates.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval Bottleneck:** The inability to retrieve relevant information from search snippets, even when the information is likely present.\n*   **Lack of Reasoning/Inference:** The system cannot effectively reason about the context of the question or make inferences to fill in missing information. It cannot determine an answer based on the *absence* of information.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Explicit Information:** The system relies too heavily on explicit information being present in the snippets, lacking the ability to synthesize or derive answers.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Retrieval**. Specifically, improving the precision and recall of the information retrieval process to ensure relevant snippets are consistently retrieved and the required information is extracted from those snippets.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Refined Search Query Generation:**\n    *   **Action:** Modify the search query generation logic to include keyword expansion, query relaxation (e.g., using synonyms), and query reformulation (e.g., breaking down complex queries into simpler ones).\n    *   **Example:** For the chess question, try queries like: `\"Adolf Anderssen Berthold Suhle 1864 chess match losses\"`, `\"Anderssen Suhle 1864 chess results\"`, `\"Anderssen vs Suhle 1864 score\"`\n2.  **Enhance Snippet Parsing with NLP Techniques:**\n    *   **Action:** Integrate more advanced NLP techniques to extract relevant information from snippets. Specifically:\n        *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Improve identification of key entities (players, dates, types of games, etc.).\n        *   **Relationship Extraction:** Identify relationships between entities (e.g., \"Adolf Anderssen *lost* X games to Berthold Suhle\").\n        *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the sentiment of sentences to infer negative information (e.g., \"Anderssen *suffered* several losses\").\n    *   **Focus on Context:** When parsing snippets, pay close attention to the surrounding context of keywords to improve the accuracy of information extraction.\n3.  **Implement \"Absence of Evidence\" Handling:**\n    *   **Action:** Train the system to handle the absence of information more intelligently. Instead of immediately stating \"Information not present,\" implement a mechanism to:\n        *   **Evaluate Confidence:** Assess the confidence level in the search results. If confidence is low, attempt alternative search strategies or utilize external knowledge sources.\n        *   **Default to Reasonable Estimates:** If definitive information cannot be found, attempt to derive a reasonable estimate based on available data or pre-existing knowledge (e.g., using the LLM to make an educated guess).\n4.  **Implement Intermediate Output Logging (CRITICAL):**\n    *   **Action:** Add detailed logging of the entire process, including:\n        *   **Generated Search Queries:** Log the exact search queries used.\n        *   **Retrieved Snippets:** Log the full text of the retrieved snippets.\n        *   **Extracted Information:** Log the information extracted from each snippet *before* the answer generation step.\n    *   **Purpose:** This will enable detailed debugging and pinpoint exactly where the system is failing.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, the recurring \"Information not present\" error suggests that capabilities are likely **stable with a significant room for improvement**. The trend will become clearer as more data points and iterations are available. The implementation of Intermediate Output Logging is a critical step to providing useful data for determining the capability trend.\n",

Specifically in the first error case, it fails to find the losses of Adolf Anderssen in his 1864 chess match against Berthold Suhle.\n*   **Inability to Handle Negations/Absence of Information:** The system struggles to differentiate between \"information not present\" and a definitive answer (e.g., the answer is zero). It returns \"Information...not present\" when it needs to be able to use an LLM to extract the correct answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Poor Information Retrieval:** The inability to retrieve relevant information from search snippets is the biggest bottleneck. The system needs more robust techniques for searching and identifying the correct information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   The primary error pattern is the system stating information is not present in search snippets when it is likely present but not being effectively extracted or found.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe single most critical problem is the **inadequate retrieval of relevant information from search snippets**. The search queries and information extraction methods used by the system are not specific or robust enough to find the required details, leading to \"information not present\" answers even when the information is potentially available.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Significantly improve the system's ability to find and extract relevant information from search snippets. This includes refining search queries and improving the text parsing/extraction methods.\n*   **Knowledge Generation:** The system should try to derive a reasonable answer from the available information or from pre-existing knowledge before defaulting to \"information not present\". If an exact answer cannot be found, a best estimate or range should be considered.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Refine Search Queries:** Implement more sophisticated search query generation techniques. Use techniques like keyword expansion, query relaxation, and query reformulation to broaden and refine the search. For example, include variations of the entity name, and related terms.\n2.  **Improve Snippet Parsing:** Improve how the system parses and understands the meaning of search snippets. The system should leverage more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract relevant information even if it's not explicitly stated in a simple format. Specifically, look for mentions of \"losses\" when \"chess match\" and the two players names appear in the same snippet.\n3.  **Implement Multi-Hop Reasoning:** The system should be capable of performing multi-hop reasoning to synthesize information from multiple snippets or sources. It needs to link pieces of information together to answer complex questions.\n4.  **Integrate External Knowledge:** Supplement the search snippet information with external knowledge sources (e.g., a chess database) to help answer questions when information retrieval is limited. This will help if the precise match records are not returned via a simple search.\n5. **Implement Intermediate Output Logging:** Add print statements to log intermediate steps, especially the search queries, retrieved snippets, and extracted information before the answer generation step. This allows for retrospective debugging.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction failed, decision_making failed. The system incorrectly determined that the information was not present.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System Assessment\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Overall Pattern:** The system demonstrates partial success in information extraction and answering but falters significantly when precise information retrieval is required or when dealing with potentially incomplete information. The \"Information not present\" response is a recurring issue, even when the information seems retrievable with more robust techniques.\n*   **Successful Examples:** The first two examples showcase accurate information extraction and answer generation when the relevant information is readily available in the retrieved snippets.\n*   **Failure Analysis:** The third example clearly demonstrates the critical weakness. The system fails to identify and extract the number of losses from the search snippets, defaulting to a canned \"Information not present\" response. The prompt directs the system to use an LLM to try to extract a correct answer.\n*   **Intermediate Logging Needed:** Without intermediate logging (search queries, retrieved snippets), it's impossible to pinpoint *exactly* where the failure occurs. Is the *correct* snippet not being retrieved? Is the snippet being retrieved, but the relevant information is not being extracted? The \"Information not present\" answer does not help in debugging.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system has a moderate level of capability in question answering when the required information is directly and easily accessible. However, its ability to handle more complex queries, especially those requiring nuanced information retrieval or inference, is limited. The system demonstrates a significant reliance on explicit information presence in search snippets and lacks the ability to intelligently reason or leverage external knowledge to compensate for incomplete information.\n\n* **Accuracy:** Demonstrates roughly 67% accuracy based on the provided data. This indicates a significant room for improvement.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Information Extraction and Answer Generation:** The system can accurately extract and present information when it is readily available and easily identifiable in the retrieved snippets.\n*   **Partial Information Extraction:** The system can extract key information like names and dates.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Information Retrieval Bottleneck:** The inability to retrieve relevant information from search snippets, even when the information is likely present.\n*   **Lack of Reasoning/Inference:** The system cannot effectively reason about the context of the question or make inferences to fill in missing information. It cannot determine an answer based on the *absence* of information.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Explicit Information:** The system relies too heavily on explicit information being present in the snippets, lacking the ability to synthesize or derive answers.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Retrieval**.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a classification-based approach to transform grids, leveraging an LLM to first identify the transformation type (arithmetic, mirroring, or neighbor-based). Based on the identified type, a specialized function is called, which uses the LLM with a specific prompt to apply the corresponding transformation. The script involves an agent role as an expert in classifying grid transformations. The functions used are `main`, `identify_transformation_type`, `apply_arithmetic_transformation`, `apply_mirroring_transformation`, `apply_neighbor_based_transformation`, and `call_llm`; `main` orchestrates the process, `identify_transformation_type` classifies the transformation, the `apply_*` functions apply the transformation, and `call_llm` interacts with the LLM. The overall workflow is: identify transformation type -> apply corresponding transformation -> validate output format.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe runtime error observed across all three error cases is: \"[[ERROR: The returned grid did not start with '[[' and end with ']]']]\". This indicates that the system failed to generate a valid grid output formatted as a list of lists enclosed in square brackets. This is not a typical Python error like JSONDecodeError or TypeError, but rather an error message generated by the system itself, likely during a post-processing or validation step after the grid generation process.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the limited data (only error cases), it's difficult to identify specific strengths. However, we can infer some potential strengths:\n\n1. **Error Detection:** The system correctly identifies that its output is not in the expected format (a list of lists enclosed in square brackets). This shows it has some form of output validation.\n2. **Problem Decomposition:** The system is designed to tackle grid transformation tasks, which suggests an ability to understand and decompose the problem into manageable steps.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1. **Grid Generation:** The system consistently fails to generate a valid grid output, as indicated by the prevalent error message. This is a fundamental weakness.\n2. **Pattern Recognition/Extrapolation:** Even with multiple training examples, the system is unable to extrapolate the underlying transformation pattern to the test input.\n3. **Robustness:** The system appears fragile, as it errors out completely instead of producing a potentially imperfect but still usable output.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1. **Pattern Understanding and Application:** The primary bottleneck appears to be the system's inability to correctly understand and apply the transformation pattern learned from the training examples to the test input.\n2. **Output Formatting:** A secondary bottleneck is the system's failure to produce a correctly formatted grid, even when potentially having derived the correct numerical values for the grid. This suggest a disconnect between the reasoning engine and the output formatting component.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is the \"[[ERROR: The returned grid did not start with '[[' and end with ']]']]\". This suggests a systematic failure in the final stage of processing, where the generated grid data is formatted into the expected string representation. This could stem from an error in the construction of the list of lists, an incorrect serialization step, or a complete failure to generate grid data in the first place.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to *consistently and reliably* generate valid grid outputs that conform to the problem requirements.  This manifests as a failure to both correctly *deduce* the grid transformation pattern and *format* the resulting data into the desired `[[...]]` structure.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1. **Pattern Learning:** Improve the system's ability to learn and generalize transformation patterns from the training examples. This might involve exploring different machine learning models, feature extraction techniques, or reasoning algorithms.\n2. **Output Formatting:** Enhance the output formatting module to ensure that the generated grid data is always correctly formatted as a list of lists enclosed in square brackets.\n3. **Debugging/Error Reporting:** Implement more detailed logging and error reporting to provide insights into the system's reasoning process and the specific steps that lead to failure. Adding print statements to show intermediate outputs can be useful.\n4. **Constraint handling**: It's unclear from the current error message how constraints related to grid size and numbers are being handled.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Implement a more robust pattern learning algorithm.** Consider using sequence-to-sequence models or graph neural networks to learn the grid transformations. Experiment with different hyperparameter settings and regularization techniques.\n2. **Introduce unit tests for the output formatting module.** These tests should verify that the module can correctly format various grid data structures into the expected `[[...]]` format.\n3. **Add detailed logging and error reporting throughout the system.** Log intermediate results, decisions, and potential errors to help diagnose the root cause of the failures. Include input grid size and other key parameters in the log.\n4. **Implement a \"sanity check\" before formatting the output.** Ensure the output grid is not empty, contains only allowed characters and that the dimensions are right, before formatting it to the expected format.\n5. **Implement a rule-based transformation engine as a fallback.** If the pattern learning algorithm fails to produce a confident prediction, fall back to a simpler rule-based engine that can handle basic grid transformations.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID: 0**\n- pattern_understanding: Failure\n- solution_generation: Failure\n- solution_verification: Failure\n- output_formatting: Failure (due to error in grid data).\n\n**Sample ID: 1**\n- pattern_understanding: Failure\n- solution_generation: Failure\n- solution_verification: Failure\n- output_formatting: Failure (due to error in grid data).\n\n**Sample ID: 2**\n- pattern_understanding: Failure\n- solution_generation: Failure\n- solution_verification: Failure\n- output_formatting: Failure (due to error in grid data).\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**System Name:** AI Grid Transformer\n\n**Version:** 1.0 (Based on the provided data)\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs consistently show the same error message: \"[[ERROR: The returned grid did not start with '[[' and end with ']]']]\". This indicates a complete failure in the final output formatting stage.  The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` markers suggest the system *attempts* to produce an answer, but it consistently fails to generate a valid grid structure. There's no indication of any intermediate results or variations in the error, suggesting a systematic and deterministic failure rather than a random one. The consistency of the error points towards a problem in the system's fundamental architecture, or a significant bug in its final processing stages.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates very limited capabilities.  While it has *some* capacity for problem decomposition (implied by its design to handle grid transformations), it fails to perform the core function of generating a valid grid output. Its accuracy is 0%, indicating a complete inability to solve the given tasks.  The error detection mechanism is functional but doesn't compensate for the lack of successful grid generation.  Essentially, the system can identify its own failures, but it cannot recover from them.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Error Detection:** The system correctly identifies and flags incorrectly formatted outputs.  This provides a mechanism for debugging and improvement. (Though not an end in itself.)\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Grid Generation & Pattern Recognition:** The system fundamentally fails to generate valid grid outputs. This stems from a failure to identify and apply grid transformation patterns.\n*   **Output Formatting:** Even if the correct grid values were derived, the system fails to properly format them into the expected `[[...]]` structure. This is a critical weakness, as it renders the entire system unusable.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** The system lacks robustness, completely failing instead of attempting to produce a partially correct or approximate solution.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Grid Generation and Pattern Recognition**. Without the ability to generate even a single correct grid, the system is essentially useless. Addressing the output formatting issue, while important, is secondary to solving the core pattern recognition and transformation problem.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Debugging Focus: Implement detailed logging and intermediate output prints.** Add print statements to log:\n    *   Input grid sizes and values.\n    *   Any intermediate grids generated during processing.\n    *   The inferred transformation pattern (if any).\n    *   The state of the grid data just *before* the output formatting stage.\n    This level of detail is essential to pinpoint where the failure occurs.\n2.  **Simplify the Output Formatting:** Replace the complex output formatting logic with a simple, directly-coded function that takes a Python list of lists and converts it into the `[[...]]` string format.  Ensure this simplified function is thoroughly unit tested.  This will help isolate whether the problem lies in the generation of the grid *data* or the formatting *process*. Start with a hard coded solution.\n3.  **Implement a \"Basic Grid Generator\" Subsystem:** Create a separate, simpler subsystem designed to handle only the *simplest* possible grid transformations (e.g., identity transformation, a simple rotation, or a basic addition of a constant value to each cell). Test this subsystem extensively and ensure it produces correctly formatted outputs *before* reintegrating with the main pattern learning algorithm. This will provide a known-good baseline to build upon.\n4.  **Investigate Alternative Pattern Learning Approaches:** Given the failure of the current approach, explore alternative pattern learning techniques.  Consider:\n    *   **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Models:** These models are commonly used for translation tasks and could be adapted to learn grid transformations as a sequence-to-sequence mapping.\n    *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs excel at image recognition and may be useful for identifying patterns within the grid data. Consider using a CNN to extract features from the input grid and then using a separate model to generate the output grid.\n5.  **Data Augmentation (If Feasible):**  If the dataset is limited, explore data augmentation techniques to artificially increase the number of training examples.  This might involve creating rotated, flipped, or slightly modified versions of the existing grids. *But focus on getting even one task to succeed first before augmenting data.*\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining.**  Based on the provided data, the system's capabilities are non-existent and show no signs of improvement. This indicates a fundamental problem in the system's architecture or implementation. Until the core issue of grid generation and output formatting is addressed, the trend will remain negative.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting structured meeting information (participants, duration, time constraints, and existing schedules) using the `extract_structured_meeting_info` function, which uses the LLM to extract information in JSON format from the prompt. The `find_meeting_slot_with_react` function then uses the ReAct pattern to find a valid meeting slot, where the LLM reasons about potential slots, proposes a slot as an action, and observes for conflicts based on participant schedules until a suitable slot is found or no slot can be found. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `extract_structured_meeting_info` to parse the question, then uses `find_meeting_slot_with_react` to determine the best slot, and finally returns the found meeting slot or an error message if it failed.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error patterns identified in the error analysis report. Specifically:\n\n*   **Missed Valid Solutions:** The outputs show that in at least two cases (\"Sample 1\" and \"Sample 2\"), the system found a valid meeting slot, as evidenced by the presence of a specific time within `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags. However, in \"Sample 4\", the system incorrectly reports \"No valid meeting slot found.\" This directly confirms the primary issue of the system failing to identify valid solutions.\n*   **String Formatting:** The presence of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` suggests that the formatting is at least partially working, allowing for parsing of the answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a *limited* capability in scheduling meetings with constraints. It can process relatively complex scenarios, but struggles with accurately applying the constraints, especially when those constraints require deeper reasoning or exhaustive search. The system appears to have a basic framework for scheduling, but the core constraint evaluation and solution generation logic are flawed.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Scenario Processing:** The system can ingest and process relatively complex scheduling scenarios with multiple participants and time blocks.\n*   **Partial Formatting:** The formatting is mostly working, indicating an ability to generate structured output.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The system consistently fails to accurately interpret and apply constraints related to busy schedules. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Premature Search Termination:** The system seems to prematurely terminate its search for valid slots, leading to missed opportunities.\n*   **Lack of Transparency (Reasoning Trace):** The absence of a reasoning trace makes debugging extremely difficult.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**. Correctly interpreting and applying constraints is the foundation of any successful scheduling system. Without accurate constraint handling, the system will continue to produce incorrect results, regardless of improvements in other areas.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, directly addressing the identified weaknesses and improvement focus:\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Availability Matrix:** Create an explicit availability matrix for each participant, representing their availability in small time increments (e.g., 15-minute intervals). This should be implemented in code, not just as a conceptual idea. This will also help the LLM focus on the reasoning/slot-selection aspects, and reduce its burden from parsing constraints.\n\n    *   *Implementation Detail:* The matrix should be a data structure (e.g., a list of lists or a pandas DataFrame) that can be easily accessed and manipulated by the system.\n2.  **Implement Constraint Checking Function:** Develop a dedicated function, `is_slot_available(slot, participants, availability_matrix)`, that checks whether a given time slot satisfies all constraints based on the availability matrix.  This will focus the logic and make it easier to test and validate.\n\n    *   *Implementation Detail:* This function should take a time slot, a list of participants, and the availability matrix as input. It should return `True` if the slot is available for all participants and `False` otherwise. Test this function *independently* with various scenarios.\n3.  **Implement Iterative Slot Search with Backtracking:** Implement a systematic slot search algorithm, incorporating iterative search and backtracking. Start with the earliest possible slot, and increment the time in small steps (e.g., 15 minutes). If a conflict is found, increment the time again. When the end of the day is reached, go to the next day and repeat.\n\n    *   *Implementation Detail:* This algorithm should use the `is_slot_available()` function to check the availability of each slot. If a slot is unavailable, the algorithm should *increment* the time slot until a valid time is found or the end of the search period is reached.\n4.  **Add Detailed Logging to *ALL* Parts of the System:**  Introduce granular logging at all stages, especially within the constraint checking function and the slot search algorithm. Log the constraints being considered, the slots being evaluated, the results of the `is_slot_available()` function, and the reasons for accepting or rejecting each slot.\n    *   *Implementation Detail:* Use a proper logging library (e.g., `logging` in Python) to manage the logging output.  Make sure the log messages are clear, informative, and easily searchable.\n5. **Modify Prompting Strategy:**\n    * Rather than directly asking to find a final solution, make the prompt a step-by-step reasoning task.\n    * Break the prompt into discrete steps: `1. Extract constraints`, `2. Generate potential slots`, `3. Filter slots based on constraints`, `4. Output valid slots`\n    * Use a ReAct approach to give the LLM iterative attempts at reasoning.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the capability trend is currently **stable at a low level**. While the system can process scheduling scenarios, its inability to accurately handle constraints prevents it from providing reliable results. These proposed improvements should lead to a sharp increase in accuracy.\n",

The system appears to complete execution without crashing, but it arrives at incorrect conclusions.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n- The system attempts to follow the scheduling instructions and considers constraints.\n- The system is able to process relatively complex scheduling scenarios with multiple participants and time blocks.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n- **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The system struggles with accurately interpreting and applying constraints related to busy schedules. This is evident in cases where valid meeting slots are missed.\n- **Limited Reasoning Depth:** The system lacks the reasoning depth necessary to fully explore all possible meeting slots and accurately determine availability.\n- **Lack of Explicit Reasoning Trace:** There is no explicit log of the system's reasoning process, making it difficult to pinpoint exactly where the errors occur.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Constraint Evaluation:** Accurately evaluating whether a given time slot satisfies all constraints.\n- **Exhaustive Slot Search:** Thoroughly searching for all possible meeting slots, especially when dealing with multiple participants and busy schedules.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- **Missed Valid Solutions:** In all error cases, the system fails to identify a valid meeting slot that is presented in the golden answer.\n- **Binary Output:** The system returns a binary output (\"Valid slot found\" or \"No valid slot found\"), which does not give insight into the decision making.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to accurately evaluate time slot availability, leading to missed valid solutions. This suggests a flaw in the core constraint handling logic. The system seems to prematurely terminate the search for valid slots before exploring all possibilities, or misinterprets participants' availabilities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Constraint Handling:** Develop more robust and accurate constraint handling logic to ensure that all constraints are correctly applied. This should include careful consideration of edge cases and potential conflicts.\n- **Solution Generation:** Improve the solution generation process to explore all possible meeting slots systematically and exhaustively.\n- **Reasoning Trace:** Add detailed logging to trace reasoning process, which can provide better insight into the decision making process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Explicit Availability Matrix:** Create an explicit availability matrix for each participant, representing their availability in small time increments (e.g., 15-minute intervals).

    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error patterns identified in the error analysis report. Specifically:\n\n*   **Missed Valid Solutions:** The outputs show that in at least two cases (\"Sample 1\" and \"Sample 2\"), the system found a valid meeting slot, as evidenced by the presence of a specific time within `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags. However, in \"Sample 4\", the system incorrectly reports \"No valid meeting slot found.\" This directly confirms the primary issue of the system failing to identify valid solutions.\n*   **String Formatting:** The presence of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` suggests that the formatting is at least partially working, allowing for parsing of the answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a *limited* capability in scheduling meetings with constraints. It can process relatively complex scenarios, but struggles with accurately applying the constraints, especially when those constraints require deeper reasoning or exhaustive search. The system appears to have a basic framework for scheduling, but the core constraint evaluation and solution generation logic are flawed.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Scenario Processing:** The system can ingest and process relatively complex scheduling scenarios with multiple participants and time blocks.\n*   **Partial Formatting:** The formatting is mostly working, indicating an ability to generate structured output.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The system consistently fails to accurately interpret and apply constraints related to busy schedules. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Premature Search Termination:** The system seems to prematurely terminate its search for valid slots, leading to missed opportunities.\n*   **Lack of Transparency (Reasoning Trace):** The absence of a reasoning trace makes debugging extremely difficult.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**. Correctly interpreting and applying constraints is the foundation of any successful scheduling system. Without accurate constraint handling, the system will continue to produce incorrect results, regardless of improvements in other areas.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, directly addressing the identified weaknesses and improvement focus:\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Availability Matrix:** Create an explicit availability matrix for each participant, representing their availability in small time increments (e.g., 15-minute intervals). This should be implemented in code, not just as a conceptual idea. This will also help the LLM focus on the reasoning/slot-selection aspects, and reduce its burden from parsing constraints.\n\n    *   *Implementation Detail:* The matrix should be a data structure (e.g., a list of lists or a pandas DataFrame) that can be easily accessed and manipulated by the system.\n2.  **Implement Constraint Checking Function:** Develop a dedicated function, `is_slot_available(slot, participants, availability_matrix)`, that checks whether a given time slot satisfies all constraints based on the availability matrix.  This will focus the logic and make it easier to test and validate.\n\n    *   *Implementation Detail:* This function should take a time slot, a list of participants, and the availability matrix as input. It should return `True` if the slot is available for all participants and `False` otherwise. Test this function *independently* with various scenarios.\n3.  **Implement Iterative Slot Search with Backtracking:** Implement a systematic slot search algorithm, incorporating iterative search and backtracking. Start with the earliest possible slot, and increment the time in small steps (e.g., 15 minutes). If a conflict is found, increment the time again. When the end of the day is reached, go to the next day and repeat.\n\n    *   *Implementation Detail:* This algorithm should use the `is_slot_available()` function to check the availability of each slot. If a slot is unavailable, the algorithm should *increment* the time slot until a valid time is found or the end of the search period is reached.\n4.  **Add Detailed Logging to *ALL* Parts of the System:**  Introduce granular logging at all stages, especially within the constraint checking function and the slot search algorithm. Log the constraints being considered, the slots being evaluated, the results of the `is_slot_available()` function, and the reasons for accepting or rejecting each slot.\n    *   *Implementation Detail:* Use a proper logging library (e.g., `logging` in Python) to manage the logging output.  Make sure the log messages are clear, informative, and easily searchable.\n5. **Modify Prompting Strategy:**\n    * Rather than directly asking to find a final solution, make the prompt a step-by-step reasoning task.\n    * Break the prompt into discrete steps: `1. Extract constraints`, `2. Generate potential slots`, `3. Filter slots based on constraints`, `4. Output valid slots`\n    * Use a ReAct approach to give the LLM iterative attempts at reasoning.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the capability trend is currently **stable at a low level**. While the system can process scheduling scenarios, its inability to accurately handle constraints prevents it from providing reliable results. These proposed improvements should lead to a sharp increase in accuracy.\n"

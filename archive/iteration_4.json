        "**Prompting Strategy**: Modify the prompt to explicitly demand a final answer in a specific format. For example, add 'Conclude with a line that states: 'Here is the proposed time: [DAY], [START_TIME] - [END_TIME]''.",
        "**Chain-of-Thought Reinforcement**: Add stronger wording to encourage completion of each step of reasoning. Add an explicit instruction at the end of the prompt: 'After analyzing the schedules, you MUST provide the proposed meeting time.'",
        "**Multi-Agent Architecture**: Implement a 'Solution Proposer' agent that is *explicitly* responsible for generating the final time proposal, following an 'Availability Analyzer' agent. This adds a separate step and reinforces the necessity of a final proposal.",
        "**Output Verification Agent**: Design a verification agent that checks if the output contains a concrete time proposal. If not, it should send the original problem back to the LLM with a message saying, 'You did not provide a final proposed meeting time. Please provide the time in the format specified before.'",

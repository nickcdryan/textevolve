If the system cannot understand the input, it cannot perform any other task.\n*   **Lack of LLM-Driven Approach:** The error message indicates that the parsing is probably rule or regex-based. It does not seem to use the LLM for more advanced parsing and reasoning.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Consistent Parsing Error:** The same parsing error appears across all samples, which suggests a systemic issue rather than isolated bugs.\n*   **Failure to Extract Information:** Since the system fails to parse, it also fails to extract the number of participants, schedules, constraints, etc.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **failure to parse the input using an LLM-driven approach**, resulting in a JSON parsing error. This indicates that the system is likely using a rigid, rule-based parser (possibly with `json.loads()`) that cannot handle the problem input, instead of an LLM call. The most critical problem is to rewrite the core parser to use the LLM to extract the relevant information from the question and put it into the correct format.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system needs a robust and flexible information extraction module that can reliably extract participant names, schedules, and constraints from the input text. It should use LLM calls instead of rule-based parsers.\n*   **Error Handling:** The system should provide more informative error messages that help diagnose the source of the problem. Error messages such as \"failed to extract participant names\" instead of a generic JSON parsing error will be much more helpful.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Replace Rule-Based Parsing with LLM-Driven Extraction:** Instead of using `json.loads()` or similar rule-based parsing, use an LLM to extract the necessary information from the problem description. Use a targeted prompt like:\n    ```python\n    def extract_info(problem_description):\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        You are an information extraction expert.

Ideally, the LLM should be able to recover from parsing errors.\n    ```python\n    try:\n        data = json.loads(response)\n    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(f\"Error decoding JSON: {e}\")\n        # Attempt LLM-based recovery or return a user-friendly error\n        return None\n    ```\n3. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**\n    * Decompose the scheduling problem into explicit reasoning steps using the LLM.\n    * Implement a verification agent that checks the work of the main scheduling agent.\n    * Example: `reason_step_by_step(problem, \"Let's think through this scheduling problem one step at a time...\")`\n4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**\n    * Employ specialized agents for different parts of the problem.\n    * Implement a critic agent that reviews and improves initial solutions.\n    * Example: `parser_agent(text)`, `schedule_finder_agent(constraints)`, `solution_verifier_agent(proposed_time, constraints)`\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information_extraction\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system, based on the performance summary, error analysis report, and improvement suggestions you provided.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system, in its current state, possesses **extremely limited capabilities**. It fails to correctly process and respond to any of the provided test cases, primarily due to a critical failure in parsing the input. While the design intentions show promise (e.g., aiming to handle scheduling constraints and use an expert persona), the fundamental inability to understand the problem renders these intentions irrelevant. The system is currently non-functional.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Intent to Handle Scheduling Constraints:** The problem description suggests the system is designed to handle scheduling constraints, which is a worthwhile goal. This indicates a correct high-level understanding of the problem's nature.\n*   **Prompt Engineering Considerations:** The inclusion of instructions for the system to adopt an expert persona suggests an awareness of prompt engineering techniques to guide the LLM's reasoning.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complete Parsing Failure:** The system's inability to parse input is the most significant and debilitating weakness. This prevents any further processing or reasoning. The reliance on brittle parsing methods completely undermines its potential.\n*   **Lack of LLM-Driven Processing:** The failure stems from not leveraging the LLM for understanding the problem, extracting information, and formatting. The system is not making effective use of its core asset.\n*   **Absence of Core Techniques:** Chain-of-thought reasoning, verification agents, and multi-agent collaboration\u2014all crucial for robust problem-solving\u2014are entirely absent.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **information extraction using LLM-driven parsing**. The system *must* be able to reliably extract relevant data (participants, schedules, constraints) from the input text before it can even begin to solve the scheduling problem.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nImplement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Replace ALL Rule-Based Parsing with LLM-Driven Information Extraction:** Immediately abandon any attempts to use `json.loads()` or similar rule-based parsers. Adopt the suggested LLM-based extraction method, adapting the prompt as necessary to suit the specific input format. The provided example:\n    ```python\n    def extract_info(problem_description):\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        You are an information extraction expert. Extract the following information from the text:\n\n        - participants: A list of participant names.\n        - schedules: A dictionary where the keys are participant names and the values are lists of their blocked time slots (e.g., \"9:00 to 10:00\").\n        - duration: The duration of the meeting in minutes.\n        - work_hours: The start and end times of the work day (e.g., \"9:00 to 17:00\").\n        - day: The day of the week the meeting should be scheduled on.\n\n        Here is the text:\n        {problem_description}\n\n        Return a JSON object containing this information.\n        \"\"\"\n        response = call_llm(prompt)  # Call LLM with the prompt\n        return json.loads(response)   # Load JSON from response\n\n    ```\n     is a great starting point.  Refine it based on your particular model. The `json.loads` is only used *after* the LLM extracts and structures the information.\n\n2.  **Implement Initial Error Handling and Fallback:** While the LLM *should* be robust, include a `try...except` block around the `json.loads()` call *after* the LLM extraction.  If the LLM returns something still unparsable, have the `except` block trigger a re-prompt to the LLM with a specific request to correct the JSON format. *Do not* attempt to fix it with code. The LLM should fix it, and that's where your effort should be spent.\n\n3.  **Simple End-to-End Test:** Once information extraction is implemented, create a single, *extremely simple* end-to-end test case. Focus on getting this case to work from input to (even a basic, placeholder) output. This will provide a baseline to build upon.\n\n4.  **Log Intermediate Steps:** Log the LLM's response to the information extraction prompt *before* attempting to parse it as JSON. This will be invaluable for debugging and refining the prompt.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining.** The system is currently non-functional, rendering its capabilities at the lowest possible level. Without fundamental changes to address the parsing failure, the trend will remain negative. Fixing the parsing will immediately raise the system to a usable state.\n",

The system is currently non-functional.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Intent to Handle Scheduling Constraints:** The problem description suggests the system is designed to handle scheduling constraints, which is a worthwhile goal. This indicates a correct high-level understanding of the problem's nature.\n*   **Prompt Engineering Considerations:** The inclusion of instructions for the system to adopt an expert persona suggests an awareness of prompt engineering techniques to guide the LLM's reasoning.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complete Parsing Failure:** The system's inability to parse input is the most significant and debilitating weakness. This prevents any further processing or reasoning. The reliance on brittle parsing methods completely undermines its potential.\n*   **Lack of LLM-Driven Processing:** The failure stems from not leveraging the LLM for understanding the problem, extracting information, and formatting. The system is not making effective use of its core asset.\n*   **Absence of Core Techniques:** Chain-of-thought reasoning, verification agents, and multi-agent collaboration\u2014all crucial for robust problem-solving\u2014are entirely absent.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **information extraction using LLM-driven parsing**. The system *must* be able to reliably extract relevant data (participants, schedules, constraints) from the input text before it can even begin to solve the scheduling problem.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nImplement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Replace ALL Rule-Based Parsing with LLM-Driven Information Extraction:** Immediately abandon any attempts to use `json.loads()` or similar rule-based parsers. Adopt the suggested LLM-based extraction method, adapting the prompt as necessary to suit the specific input format. The provided example:\n    ```python\n    def extract_info(problem_description):\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        You are an information extraction expert. Extract the following information from the text:\n\n        - participants: A list of participant names.\n        - schedules: A dictionary where the keys are participant names and the values are lists of their blocked time slots (e.g., \"9:00 to 10:00\").\n        - duration: The duration of the meeting in minutes.\n        - work_hours: The start and end times of the work day (e.g., \"9:00 to 17:00\").\n        - day: The day of the week the meeting should be scheduled on.\n\n        Here is the text:\n        {problem_description}\n\n        Return a JSON object containing this information.\n        \"\"\"\n        response = call_llm(prompt)  # Call LLM with the prompt\n        return json.loads(response)   # Load JSON from response\n\n    ```\n     is a great starting point.  Refine it based on your particular model. The `json.loads` is only used *after* the LLM extracts and structures the information.\n\n2.  **Implement Initial Error Handling and Fallback:** While the LLM *should* be robust, include a `try...except` block around the `json.loads()` call *after* the LLM extraction.  If the LLM returns something still unparsable, have the `except` block trigger a re-prompt to the LLM with a specific request to correct the JSON format. *Do not* attempt to fix it with code. The LLM should fix it, and that's where your effort should be spent.\n\n3.  **Simple End-to-End Test:** Once information extraction is implemented, create a single, *extremely simple* end-to-end test case. Focus on getting this case to work from input to (even a basic, placeholder) output. This will provide a baseline to build upon.\n\n4.  **Log Intermediate Steps:** Log the LLM's response to the information extraction prompt *before* attempting to parse it as JSON. This will be invaluable for debugging and refining the prompt.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining.** The system is currently non-functional, rendering its capabilities at the lowest possible level. Without fundamental changes to address the parsing failure, the trend will remain negative. Fixing the parsing will immediately raise the system to a usable state.\n"

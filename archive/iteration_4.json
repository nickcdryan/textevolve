  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using LLMs to extract constraints, generate potential time slots, and filter for a valid meeting time. It decomposes the problem into constraint extraction with validation, time slot generation, and time slot filtering. `extract_constraints_with_validation` extracts and validates meeting constraints and uses `call_llm` to extract and validate, while `generate_time_slots` generates potential time slots and uses `call_llm` for generation, and `filter_time_slots` filters slots and also uses `call_llm`. The overall workflow involves extracting constraints, generating time slots, filtering for a valid time, and reporting the result, with validation feedback used in the first step for increased reliability.",

      "text_report": "Okay, I will provide a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and the prompt instructions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs clearly show that the system is consistently failing at the first step: extracting and validating constraints. The error message \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" indicates that the LLM is returning an empty string or a non-JSON string where valid JSON is expected. The consistent failure across all samples highlights a fundamental problem in either the prompt design or the LLM's ability to follow the instructions. This suggests that the reliance on JSON is a flawed approach, at least in its current implementation.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has extremely limited capabilities. While the design aims for complex scheduling, the inability to extract constraints renders it completely non-functional. The system can be said to have successfully *attempted* to implement a scheduling solution, but the core dependency of JSON output has not succeeded in any case.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Ambitious Design:** The system attempts to address a complex real-world problem (scheduling with constraints).\n*   **Structured Output Goal:** The intention to use JSON for structured output is good in principle (for downstream processing), but needs a better approach.\n*   **Example-Based Prompting:** The use of examples in the prompt is a valid strategy.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complete Failure in Constraint Extraction:** The system *always* fails to extract constraints, making it unusable.\n*   **Brittle JSON Dependency:** The system's reliance on perfect JSON output is a major point of failure.\n*   **Inadequate Error Handling:** The error messages are generic and do not provide enough information for debugging.\n*   **Over-Reliance on LLM**: Relies too much on a single LLM call instead of breaking the problem into smaller, verifiable steps.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**, specifically extracting the constraints from the input text. This is the critical bottleneck that prevents the entire system from functioning. The goal should be to reliably extract constraint information from the input text, even if it isn't perfectly formatted.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Move Away from Strict JSON Output:** Abandon the requirement for the LLM to output *only* JSON. Instead, instruct the LLM to extract constraints in a more natural language format or a simpler format like a comma-separated list, followed by Python code to parse this into structured variables. This drastically reduces the likelihood of complete failure due to JSON parsing errors.\n\n2.  **Implement a Multi-Stage Information Extraction Process:**\n    *   **Stage 1: Constraint Identification:** First, instruct the LLM to simply identify the sentences in the input that contain constraints.\n    *   **Stage 2: Constraint Extraction:** Then, instruct it to extract the specific constraints from those sentences. This simplifies the task and makes it more manageable for the LLM.\n\n3.  **Refine the Prompt with Negative Examples:** Include examples of *incorrect* JSON output (or other formats) and explicitly instruct the LLM to avoid these patterns. This can help to guide the LLM towards the desired output format.\n\n4.  **Implement a Robust Parsing Function with Fallbacks:**\n    *   Write Python code to parse the LLM's output.\n    *   Use regular expressions or string manipulation to extract the constraint information, even if the format isn't perfect.\n    *   Provide default constraints if the extraction fails completely.\n\n5.  **Improve Error Handling with Specific Messages:** Replace the generic \"Could not extract valid constraints\" message with more informative messages that indicate the specific parsing error and the problematic input.\n\n6.  **Limit LLM complexity by splitting into separate calls**: Remove the large prompt and split it into separate steps with separate calls to the LLM to improve reliability.\n\n7.  **Implement a Multi-Agent Approach**: Create a specialized agent for constraint extraction and another for solution generation, with a verifier agent to check that the constraints extracted are valid.\n\n8.  **Test the Extraction Logic Thoroughly**: Create a dedicated test suite with a variety of input examples (including edge cases) to ensure that the constraint extraction logic is robust.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable (at zero)**. The system consistently fails to perform the core task of constraint extraction. It needs significant modifications to become functional.\n\nBy implementing these actionable recommendations, the next iteration should see a marked improvement in the system's ability to extract constraints and, consequently, its overall performance. The key is to move away from the brittle JSON dependency and adopt a more robust and flexible approach to information extraction.\n",

The error message \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" indicates that the LLM is returning an empty string or a non-JSON string where valid JSON is expected. The consistent failure across all samples highlights a fundamental problem in either the prompt design or the LLM's ability to follow the instructions. This suggests that the reliance on JSON is a flawed approach, at least in its current implementation.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has extremely limited capabilities. While the design aims for complex scheduling, the inability to extract constraints renders it completely non-functional. The system can be said to have successfully *attempted* to implement a scheduling solution, but the core dependency of JSON output has not succeeded in any case.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Ambitious Design:** The system attempts to address a complex real-world problem (scheduling with constraints).\n*   **Structured Output Goal:** The intention to use JSON for structured output is good in principle (for downstream processing), but needs a better approach.\n*   **Example-Based Prompting:** The use of examples in the prompt is a valid strategy.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complete Failure in Constraint Extraction:** The system *always* fails to extract constraints, making it unusable.\n*   **Brittle JSON Dependency:** The system's reliance on perfect JSON output is a major point of failure.\n*   **Inadequate Error Handling:** The error messages are generic and do not provide enough information for debugging.\n*   **Over-Reliance on LLM**: Relies too much on a single LLM call instead of breaking the problem into smaller, verifiable steps.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**, specifically extracting the constraints from the input text. This is the critical bottleneck that prevents the entire system from functioning. The goal should be to reliably extract constraint information from the input text, even if it isn't perfectly formatted.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Move Away from Strict JSON Output:** Abandon the requirement for the LLM to output *only* JSON. Instead, instruct the LLM to extract constraints in a more natural language format or a simpler format like a comma-separated list, followed by Python code to parse this into structured variables. This drastically reduces the likelihood of complete failure due to JSON parsing errors.\n\n2.  **Implement a Multi-Stage Information Extraction Process:**\n    *   **Stage 1: Constraint Identification:** First, instruct the LLM to simply identify the sentences in the input that contain constraints.\n    *   **Stage 2: Constraint Extraction:** Then, instruct it to extract the specific constraints from those sentences. This simplifies the task and makes it more manageable for the LLM.\n\n3.  **Refine the Prompt with Negative Examples:** Include examples of *incorrect* JSON output (or other formats) and explicitly instruct the LLM to avoid these patterns. This can help to guide the LLM towards the desired output format.\n\n4.  **Implement a Robust Parsing Function with Fallbacks:**\n    *   Write Python code to parse the LLM's output.\n    *   Use regular expressions or string manipulation to extract the constraint information, even if the format isn't perfect.\n    *   Provide default constraints if the extraction fails completely.\n\n5.  **Improve Error Handling with Specific Messages:** Replace the generic \"Could not extract valid constraints\" message with more informative messages that indicate the specific parsing error and the problematic input.\n\n6.  **Limit LLM complexity by splitting into separate calls**: Remove the large prompt and split it into separate steps with separate calls to the LLM to improve reliability.\n\n7.  **Implement a Multi-Agent Approach**: Create a specialized agent for constraint extraction and another for solution generation, with a verifier agent to check that the constraints extracted are valid.\n\n8.  **Test the Extraction Logic Thoroughly**: Create a dedicated test suite with a variety of input examples (including edge cases) to ensure that the constraint extraction logic is robust.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable (at zero)**. The system consistently fails to perform the core task of constraint extraction. It needs significant modifications to become functional.\n\nBy implementing these actionable recommendations, the next iteration should see a marked improvement in the system's ability to extract constraints and, consequently, its overall performance. The key is to move away from the brittle JSON dependency and adopt a more robust and flexible approach to information extraction.\n"

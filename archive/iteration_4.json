  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-based techniques to solve grid transformation problems by first extracting the transformation rule and then applying it to the test grid, using validation steps to ensure accuracy. The problem is decomposed into rule extraction and grid transformation, each with its own validation step. Two implicit agent roles are used: a grid transformation expert for rule extraction and a meticulous grid transformer for applying the rule. The function `call_llm` sends prompts to the LLM, `extract_transformation_with_validation` extracts the rule, `transform_grid_with_validation` applies the rule, `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates rule extraction and grid transformation, and `main` serves as the entry point. The overall workflow involves extracting a transformation rule from training examples, validating the extracted rule, applying the rule to a test grid, and validating the transformed grid.",

While some non-zero elements exist, their placement does not reflect the patterns observed in training examples for this task (which is to generate a grid matching a sample grid that was provided in JSON format). The pattern is not picked up at all.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The code attempts expansion, substitution, and row insertion. The logic for expansion is present but doesn't produce the correct result. The intended expansion is to duplicate columns, but the generated output suggests issues with the logic to perform this grid transformation. The substitution intended to replace some values with '8' introduces errors. The inserted rows of '8' are also incorrect.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The code attempts to mirror non-zero elements across the vertical center. The implementation has a critical flaw: it doesn't check if the mirrored cell is already non-zero *before* assigning the mirrored value. This overwrites existing numbers, corrupting the pattern, which goes against the prompt. The output is a modified grid, but with unintended modifications to existing non-zero elements.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a *very low* level of capability in grid transformation tasks. While it can generate code that attempts to address the problem, the code consistently contains logical errors and fails to accurately implement the intended transformations. The system struggles with pattern recognition, generalizing from training examples, and handling constraints. The current accuracy is 0%, indicating a need for significant improvement.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation for Transformations:** The system can generate Python code to perform grid transformations.  This is a foundational capability.\n*   **Attempt at Pattern Extraction:** The system attempts to learn and apply patterns from training examples, even if the application is flawed.\n*   **Modular Attempts:** In the second sample, the system tries to break the transformation down into expansion, substitution, and insertion, which is a good start.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system fails to accurately recognize and generalize patterns from training examples.\n*   **Code Logic:** The generated code contains logical errors that prevent accurate transformations. Indexing, conditional statements, and iterative processes are frequently incorrect.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system often violates constraints, such as overwriting existing values, indicating a lack of robust constraint management.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system does not verify that the solution matches the expected pattern after transformation.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Accurate Code Generation**. The system needs to learn to correctly identify patterns in the input data and then translate those patterns into logically sound, executable code.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Feature Extraction:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace or augment the current pattern recognition module with a CNN. Train the CNN on a large dataset of grid transformation examples. The CNN should output parameters or instructions that guide code generation.\n    *   **Rationale:** CNNs are effective at automatically learning spatial features from images, which is directly applicable to grid-based patterns.\n2.  **Develop a Code Verification/Validation Module:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement a module that *symbolically executes* the generated code against sample inputs from the training data *before* execution. The symbolic execution engine should flag any violations of the transformation rules.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will prevent flawed code from being deployed and provide feedback for the code generation module.\n3.  **Refactor Code Generation with Parameterized Templates:**\n    *   **Action:** Shift from free-form code generation to a template-based approach. Define templates for common grid transformations (e.g., mirroring, rotation, expansion). The CNN (or pattern recognition module) should output parameters that fill in these templates.\n    *   **Rationale:** Templates reduce the risk of logical errors and ensure more structured code.\n4.  **Implement a more comprehensive test suite:**\n    *   **Action:** Augment the test suite with more examples. Include examples where the transformation rules are more complex or nested.\n    *   **Rationale:** Testing the output of the system against the expected output allows you to identify and address the areas in which the system is failing.\n5.  **Enhance Debugging Capabilities:**\n    *   **Action:** Add print statements (or logging) to intermediate steps in the code generation and execution process.  This allows for tracing the system's reasoning and identifying where errors occur.\n    *   **Rationale:** Improved visibility into the system's internal workings facilitates debugging and understanding failure modes.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level**. Without significant architectural changes and targeted improvements, the system is unlikely to improve substantially. The implementation of the above recommendations should be monitored closely to assess whether the capabilities are improving.\n",

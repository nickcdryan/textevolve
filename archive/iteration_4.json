  "approach_summary": "The script uses a fact verification approach with multi-source integration, leveraging the Gemini LLM to answer factual questions. It decomposes the problem into generating multiple search queries, simulating context retrieval from these queries while verifying their relevance, extracting answers from each context, synthesizing a final answer, and validating that final answer. The agent roles include an expert at generating diverse search queries, an agent for validating retrieved context, an expert at extracting and synthesizing answers, and an expert answer validator. The functions used are `call_llm` which interacts with the Gemini LLM, and `main` which orchestrates the overall workflow involving prompt generation, LLM calls, and result validation.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nHere's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and other contextual information.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample outputs reveal a consistent pattern: the system relies almost exclusively on the provided context. When context is absent or insufficient, it defaults to \"cannot answer\" rather than attempting to retrieve the necessary information. This is evident in all three sample executions.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system correctly identifies the lack of context but makes no attempt to find the missing information (the year Etta Cone last visited Europe).\n*   **Sample ID 1:** This is the only successful execution.  The system acknowledges the lack of real context but, critically, goes on to *hypothesize* about what a real answer *might* be and how it would determine it. This indicates some reasoning ability, even though it is reliant on a hypothetical.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** Similar to Sample ID 0, the system identifies the missing context (the architect who completed the chapel) and states that it cannot extract an answer.\n\nThere are no apparent runtime errors, suggesting the core information extraction module is functioning correctly when it has sufficient input. The issue is upstream of that module: the system needs a mechanism to *obtain* relevant input in the first place. The mapping suggests \"information\\_extraction\" and \"solution\\_generation\" should be strengths, but their usage is severely limited by the lack of initial information retrieval.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates limited capabilities in its current state. While it can parse questions, identify missing information, and even reason hypothetically, its inability to access external knowledge severely restricts its performance. The system essentially functions as a sophisticated lookup tool, but it fails when the information is not readily available within the provided context. It gets 1/3 accurate, but it is also important to recognize in the successful case it makes a *hypothetical* answer.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Question Understanding:** The system accurately parses questions and identifies the required information.\n*   **Awareness of Contextual Insufficiency:** It correctly recognizes when the provided context is insufficient to answer a question.\n*   **Hypothetical Reasoning (Limited):** Demonstrates rudimentary reasoning and answer construction skills when presented with a hypothetical scenario (Sample ID 1).  *This is the most promising strength*.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complete Reliance on Provided Context:**  The system's inability to access external knowledge is its most critical weakness.\n*   **Passive Behavior:** The system defaults to \"cannot answer\" instead of actively seeking the missing information.\n*   **Lack of Information Retrieval Capabilities:** There is no mechanism to retrieve information from external sources.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Retrieval**.  The system *must* be able to access and utilize external knowledge sources to overcome its dependence on provided context.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Search Module (Priority):**\n    *   Integrate a search API (e.g., Google Search API, Bing Search API) into the system. This is the most crucial step.\n    *   Start with a simple implementation that focuses on retrieving relevant search results based on a generated query.\n2.  **Develop a Query Formulation Module (Priority):**\n    *   Design a module that can automatically generate search queries based on the original question and any available context.\n    *   Start with basic keyword extraction from the question and gradually refine the module to incorporate more sophisticated query formulation techniques.\n3.  **Develop a Basic Information Aggregator:**\n    *   Create a simple module that ingests a list of returned search snippets, and extract out the common information.\n4.  **Retrain using the successful case as positive reinforcement:**\n    *   Use the successful case where hypothetical reasoning was correctly applied as a model to train further interactions.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable but fundamentally limited.** The system performs consistently within its restricted scope (provided context only), but its overall usefulness is low. Improving the Information Retrieval capability will be a dramatic improvement.\n",

It acknowledges the lack of information but doesn't take steps to rectify it.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Reliance on Provided Context Only:** The most critical bottleneck is the system's complete dependence on the provided context and its inability to leverage external knowledge or search to fill in gaps.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **\"Cannot Answer\" Default:**  A recurring pattern is the system's response of \"cannot answer\" whenever the answer is not explicitly present within the provided context.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's passive behavior when faced with insufficient information. It needs to be augmented with the capability to actively seek out the necessary information via external knowledge sources (e.g., internet search). It needs a mechanism to detect if information is lacking, formulate a relevant query, retrieve information, extract the answer, and then respond to the original question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Information Retrieval:** Integrate a mechanism for retrieving external information when the initial context is insufficient.\n2.  **Answer Synthesis from External Sources:** Develop the capability to synthesize answers from multiple external sources to improve accuracy and reliability.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a Search Module:** Integrate a search API (e.g., Google Search API) into the system.\n2.  **Develop a Query Formulation Module:** Create a module that can automatically formulate relevant search queries based on the question and the available context.\n3.  **Enhance Answer Extraction:** Improve the answer extraction module to identify and extract answers from the retrieved search results.\n4.  **Develop a Confidence Scoring Mechanism:** Implement a system for scoring the confidence level of the extracted answer, taking into account the source's reliability and the consistency of information across multiple sources. This would allow the system to provide answers with associated confidence levels, or to abstain from answering if the confidence is too low.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nHere's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and other contextual information.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample outputs reveal a consistent pattern: the system relies almost exclusively on the provided context. When context is absent or insufficient, it defaults to \"cannot answer\" rather than attempting to retrieve the necessary information. This is evident in all three sample executions.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system correctly identifies the lack of context but makes no attempt to find the missing information (the year Etta Cone last visited Europe).\n*   **Sample ID 1:** This is the only successful execution.  The system acknowledges the lack of real context but, critically, goes on to *hypothesize* about what a real answer *might* be and how it would determine it. This indicates some reasoning ability, even though it is reliant on a hypothetical.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** Similar to Sample ID 0, the system identifies the missing context (the architect who completed the chapel) and states that it cannot extract an answer.\n\nThere are no apparent runtime errors, suggesting the core information extraction module is functioning correctly when it has sufficient input. The issue is upstream of that module: the system needs a mechanism to *obtain* relevant input in the first place. The mapping suggests \"information\\_extraction\" and \"solution\\_generation\" should be strengths, but their usage is severely limited by the lack of initial information retrieval.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates limited capabilities in its current state. While it can parse questions, identify missing information, and even reason hypothetically, its inability to access external knowledge severely restricts its performance. The system essentially functions as a sophisticated lookup tool, but it fails when the information is not readily available within the provided context. It gets 1/3 accurate, but it is also important to recognize in the successful case it makes a *hypothetical* answer.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Question Understanding:** The system accurately parses questions and identifies the required information.\n*   **Awareness of Contextual Insufficiency:** It correctly recognizes when the provided context is insufficient to answer a question.\n*   **Hypothetical Reasoning (Limited):** Demonstrates rudimentary reasoning and answer construction skills when presented with a hypothetical scenario (Sample ID 1).  *This is the most promising strength*.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complete Reliance on Provided Context:**  The system's inability to access external knowledge is its most critical weakness.\n*   **Passive Behavior:** The system defaults to \"cannot answer\" instead of actively seeking the missing information.\n*   **Lack of Information Retrieval Capabilities:** There is no mechanism to retrieve information from external sources.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Retrieval**.  The system *must* be able to access and utilize external knowledge sources to overcome its dependence on provided context.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Search Module (Priority):**\n    *   Integrate a search API (e.g., Google Search API, Bing Search API) into the system. This is the most crucial step.\n    *   Start with a simple implementation that focuses on retrieving relevant search results based on a generated query.\n2.  **Develop a Query Formulation Module (Priority):**\n    *   Design a module that can automatically generate search queries based on the original question and any available context.\n    *   Start with basic keyword extraction from the question and gradually refine the module to incorporate more sophisticated query formulation techniques.\n3.  **Develop a Basic Information Aggregator:**\n    *   Create a simple module that ingests a list of returned search snippets, and extract out the common information.\n4.  **Retrain using the successful case as positive reinforcement:**\n    *   Use the successful case where hypothetical reasoning was correctly applied as a model to train further interactions.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable but fundamentally limited.** The system performs consistently within its restricted scope (provided context only), but its overall usefulness is low. Improving the Information Retrieval capability will be a dramatic improvement.\n"

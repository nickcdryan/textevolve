Though Manu Gin\u00f3bili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. Manu Gin\u00f3bili, who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119\u2013111.

Minnesota would respond with CB Antoine Winfield returning a blocked field goal 59&#160;yards for a touchdown, the first (and longest) ever in franchise history. New Orleans would answer with kicker Mart&#237;n Gram&#225;tica getting a 35-yard field goal, yet the Vikings replied with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 53-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Vikes took the lead on a trick play as RB Chester Taylor completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe, along with Longwell kicking a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Saints began to rally as RB Reggie Bush returned a punt 71&#160;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, New Orleans took the lead with Gram&#225;tica's 53-yard field goal and Bush's 64-yard punt return for a touchdown. Afterwards, Minnesota answered with Frerotte completing a 33-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian, along with Longwell nailing the game-winning 30-yard field goal. Antoine Winfield had a big game. In addition to his touchdown off of a blocked field goal, he had 8 tackles and a sack (with a forced fumble recovery). This was also the first time in NFL history that a game had a combination of a blocked field goal, a TD pass by a non-quarterback, two field goals of 50+ yards, and two punts returned for touchdowns.\n\nQUESTION: Who threw the first touchdown pass of the game?\n        Extracted Information: 1.

After a Patriots punt, the Seahawks drove all the way to the Patriots 9, but ended up forcing to settle for a 34-yard field goal by Steven Hauschka. The Patriots responded, racing 82 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 46-yard touchdown bomb from Brady to Welker. Seattle countered with a touchdown of their own, racing 85 yards in 7 plays, scoring on a 24-yard touchdown pass from rookie Russell Wilson to Doug Baldwin, taking a 10-7 lead. The Patriots countered again, going 80 yards in 15 plays, scoring on a yard touchdown pass to Hernandez, retaking the lead 14-10.  Seattle drove to the Patriots 48 on their next drive, but Chandler Jones strip-sacked Wilson with Ninkovich recovering at the Seahawks 47. After starting the first half with a 17-10 lead, the Patriots would only score two field goals in the second half.

After a Steelers three-and-out, on the Patriots first offensive play, Brady hit Chris Hogan for a 12-yard gain, but Hogan was stripped by Jarvis Jones, who recovered the ball at the Patriots 45. The Steelers drove to the Patriots 16, but on 3rd-and-6, Landry Jones was intercepted in the end zone by Malcolm Butler on a pass intended for Antonio Brown. Taking over at their own 20, the Patriots went on an 80-yard marathon, taking 13 plays, with Brady finding James White on a 19-yard touchdown pass. After the Steelers went three-and-out again, the Patriots marched 84 more yards, scoring on Blount's 3-yard touchdown four minutes into the second quarter, increasing the Patriots lead to 14-0. The Steelers countered on their next drive. Aided by Brown's 51-yard catch, they trimmed the score to 14-7 on a 14-yard touchdown catch by Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a Patriot three-and-out, a bad punt by Ryan Allen gave the Steelers the ball at the Steelers 47. Six plays later, Jones hit Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for a holding penalty on Chris Hubbard. On the next play Jones threw an incompletion and Chris Boswell missed a 42-yard field goal. The Patriots reached midfield on their next drive, but were forced to punt. Allen pinned the Steelers at their own 6, but the Steelers challenged that the ball hit the end zone, and the ruling was reversed giving the Steelers the ball at the 20. With the better field position, the Steelers drove 66 yards to the Patriots 14, and Boswell was good from 32 yards and the score was 14-10 Patriots at halftime. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 28 and Boswell made a 46-yard field goal, trimming the score to just 14-13. The Patriots countered, through, racing 75 yards in a mere 5 plays and Brady threw a 36-yard laser to Gronkowski for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 20-13, but Gostkowski missed his second extra point of the season. Justin Gilbert returned the ensuing kickoff 32 yards to the Steelers 42. Aided by the pretty good field position, Pittsburgh responded by driving 42 yards to the Patriots 26, and Boswell kicked a 44-yard field goal trimming the score to 20-16 on the third play of the fourth quarter. The Patriots countered again, racing 75 yards and Blount scored on a 5-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 27-16. The Steelers were forced to punt on their next drive, but Edelman fumbled and the Steelers recovered at the Patriots 43. The Steelers reached the 36, but Boswell missed a 54-yard field goal, keeping the Patriots ahead 27-16. Later in the fourth quarter, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 45, but turned the ball over on downs after Jones threw an incomplete pass on 4th-and-11. Brady took a knee and the Patriots won the game. With the win the Patriots improved to 6-1 and 3-0 under Brady.\n\nQUESTION: How many catches did Brown receive?"}

After the Steelers went three-and-out again, the Patriots marched 84 more yards, scoring on Blount's 3-yard touchdown four minutes into the second quarter, increasing the Patriots lead to 14-0. The Steelers countered on their next drive. Aided by Brown's 51-yard catch, they trimmed the score to 14-7 on a 14-yard touchdown catch by Darrius Heyward-Bey. After a Patriot three-and-out, a bad punt by Ryan Allen gave the Steelers the ball at the Steelers 47. Six plays later, Jones hit Heyward-Bey for a 14-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for a holding penalty on Chris Hubbard. On the next play Jones threw an incompletion and Chris Boswell missed a 42-yard field goal. The Patriots reached midfield on their next drive, but were forced to punt. Allen pinned the Steelers at their own 6, but the Steelers challenged that the ball hit the end zone, and the ruling was reversed giving the Steelers the ball at the 20. With the better field position, the Steelers drove 66 yards to the Patriots 14, and Boswell was good from 32 yards and the score was 14-10 Patriots at halftime. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 28 and Boswell made a 46-yard field goal, trimming the score to just 14-13. The Patriots countered, through, racing 75 yards in a mere 5 plays and Brady threw a 36-yard laser to Gronkowski for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 20-13, but Gostkowski missed his second extra point of the season. Justin Gilbert returned the ensuing kickoff 32 yards to the Steelers 42. Aided by the pretty good field position, Pittsburgh responded by driving 42 yards to the Patriots 26, and Boswell kicked a 44-yard field goal trimming the score to 20-16 on the third play of the fourth quarter. The Patriots countered again, racing 75 yards and Blount scored on a 5-yard touchdown run, increasing the lead to 27-16. The Steelers were forced to punt on their next drive, but Edelman fumbled and the Steelers recovered at the Patriots 43. The Steelers reached the 36, but Boswell missed a 54-yard field goal, keeping the Patriots ahead 27-16. Later in the fourth quarter, the Steelers drove to the Patriots 45, but turned the ball over on downs after Jones threw an incomplete pass on 4th-and-11. Brady took a knee and the Patriots won the game. With the win the Patriots improved to 6-1 and 3-0 under Brady.\n\nQUESTION: How many catches did Brown receive?\n        Synthesized Answer: Two\n\n\n        Example:\n        Original Question: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?\n        Synthesized Answer: 59\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Is the answer correct and complete?

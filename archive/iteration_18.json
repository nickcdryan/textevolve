  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by extracting structured data, identifying available time slots, and proposing a meeting time, using the Gemini LLM for reasoning. The `extract_structured_data` function extracts meeting details, then validates them. The `find_available_time_slots` function uses the extracted data to reason about valid times, and `propose_meeting_time` suggests a specific time. The `call_llm` function interfaces with the Gemini API. The workflow involves extracting data, finding slots, proposing a time, with validations along the way.",

The system correctly identifies the need to schedule a meeting.\n2.  The system correctly identifies the participants for whom the meeting needs to be scheduled.\n3.  The system attempts to propose a valid meeting time based on the provided constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** The system often fails to correctly process and apply all given constraints, including existing schedules and preferences, leading to incorrect meeting time proposals.\n2.  **Solution Verification:** The system does not adequately verify its proposed solution against all constraints. If it did, it would catch the conflicts with existing schedules and preferences.\n3.  **Preference handling**: The system seems to struggle when preferences are part of the constraints.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Inaccurate Constraint Modeling:** The system's internal representation of participant schedules and preferences is likely flawed, leading to errors in availability calculations.\n2.  **Insufficient Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust verification step to confirm that the proposed solution satisfies all constraints before presenting it as the answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Ignoring busy slots:** The system frequently proposes meeting times that conflict with participants' existing busy schedules.\n2.  **Misinterpreting preferences:** The system fails to adhere to specified preferences, such as a participant's preferred days or times for meetings.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's failure to accurately model and apply all scheduling constraints, including existing schedules and preferences, leading to the selection of invalid meeting times. This suggests a flaw in how the constraints are extracted, represented, or used during solution generation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Constraint Extraction and Representation:** Improve the ability to accurately extract and represent scheduling constraints from the input text.\n2.  **Constraint Handling Logic:** Enhance the logic for applying constraints during the solution generation process.\n3.  **Solution Verification Mechanism:** Implement a robust solution verification step to ensure that the proposed meeting time satisfies all given constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Enhance Information Extraction with Few-Shot Examples:** Include few-shot examples in the prompt to guide the LLM in extracting constraints more effectively. Show examples of busy slots and preferences expressed in different ways.\n2.  **Implement a Constraint Data Structure:** Create a structured data format (e.g., a list of time ranges for each participant) to explicitly represent the constraints. This will make constraint application more programmatic and less prone to LLM errors. This data structure could be a Python dictionary of participant names and time availabilities, calculated from blocked calendar information.\n3.  **Implement Verification Agent:** Develop a verification agent that explicitly checks the proposed meeting time against each participant's availability and preferences, raising an alert if any constraint is violated. If violations are found, prompt the LLM to reconsider the proposal and fix them. Use LLM to re-write the prompt.\n4.  **Multi-Stage Reasoning:** Use a multi-stage reasoning approach: (1) Extract all schedules and preferences into structured data. (2) Reason step-by-step to find a valid time. (3) Generate the final answer.\n5.  **Add Unit Tests:** Create unit tests that verify the correctness of the constraint extraction, representation, and application logic.

However, they provide *no* insight into the *reasoning* behind the proposed times. The lack of reasoning makes it difficult to diagnose the source of the errors in constraint handling and solution verification.

There's no indication that the system even *attempts* to verify the times against participant schedules before proposing them.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary ability to identify the need for meeting scheduling and recognize participants. However, it lacks the core capability of generating valid meeting times that adhere to specified constraints. The system's solution generation process needs to be significantly enhanced in order to achieve acceptable performance.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Basic Intent Recognition:** The system correctly identifies the intent to schedule a meeting.\n*   **Participant Extraction:** The system accurately extracts the names of the participants involved.\n*   **Output Structure:** The system provides an answer in a consistent format.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Constraint Neglect:** The system consistently fails to incorporate constraints (schedules, preferences) into the solution generation process.\n*   **Absence of Verification:** There is no evidence of any verification mechanism to ensure proposed times are valid.\n*   **Lack of Explainability:** The system provides no reasoning or justification for the proposed times, hindering diagnosis and improvement.\n*   **Preference handling**: The system seems to struggle when preferences are part of the constraints.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\n**Constraint Handling**. This is the most critical bottleneck preventing the system from generating correct solutions. All other improvements are dependent on being able to accurately implement and apply constraints.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nBased on the provided suggestions, here's a prioritized and refined set of actions for the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Constraint Data Structure (CRITICAL):**\n    *   Create a Python dictionary to represent participant availability: `availability = {\"participant_name\": [(start_time, end_time), ...], ...}`. Represent preferences similarly: `preferences = {\"participant_name\": {\"preferred_days\": [...], \"preferred_times\": [...]}, ...}`.\n    *   The times in the lists should be datetime objects.\n    *   This will involve making changes to the prompt and to the code to extract information from the LLM response.\n2.  **Enhance Information Extraction with Few-Shot Examples (CRITICAL):**\n    *   Modify the prompt to include multiple examples of constraint extraction.  Show examples of different ways schedules and preferences can be expressed in the input text (e.g., \"John is busy from 2-4 PM\", \"Mary prefers mornings\", \"The team is unavailable on Fridays\").\n    *   Include negative examples where a time *seems* available but is actually blocked.\n    *   Include examples that highlight the handling of preferences expressed as a range of times or specific days.\n    *   Use a separate LLM call for extracting times and preferences. Use the LLM to extract data into JSON format.\n3.  **Implement Verification Agent (Mandatory):**\n    *   Create a `verify_schedule(proposed_time, availability, preferences)` function that takes the proposed meeting time, the availability data structure, and preference data structure as input.\n    *   This function should meticulously check for conflicts (busy slots, preference violations).\n    *   It should return a detailed report of any violations found (or a confirmation if no violations exist). This report will be used in a refinement prompt (see below).\n4.  **Refinement Prompt (Mandatory):**\n    *   If `verify_schedule` detects violations, create a new prompt that *explicitly* tells the LLM about the conflict(s). For example: \"The proposed time conflicts with John's schedule; he's busy from 2-4 PM. Please propose an alternative time.\"\n    *   Include the original problem description *and* the `availability` and `preferences` data structures (in a readable format) in the refinement prompt to give the LLM the necessary context.\n5.  **Multi-Stage Reasoning (Implement this iteratively):**\n    *   Start by implementing *just* the structured data extraction and verification steps.\n    *   Later, consider breaking the *entire* process into stages.\n6.  **Unit Testing (Implement this iteratively):**\n    *   Write unit tests for the `verify_schedule` function, covering different conflict scenarios.\n    *   Expand to test constraint extraction as time allows.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the performance summary, the system is currently **stable at a low level of accuracy.** Without significant changes to address the core weakness of constraint handling, it's unlikely to improve. The proposed changes are designed to initiate an **improving trend** by adding structure and explicit verification.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by decomposing the transformation into components like row/column operations and element replacements, then extracting specific rules for each component using an LLM. It uses a chain-of-thought approach, guiding the LLM with specific examples at each step. The agent roles include data extractor, transformation decomposer, rule extractor, and transformation applier.\n\nThe functions used are `main` (orchestrates the process), `extract_data` (extracts relevant grid data), `decompose_transformation` (decomposes the transformation), `extract_transformation_rules` (extracts transformation rules), `apply_transformation` (applies the rules), and `call_llm` (calls the Gemini API). The workflow starts with `extract_data`, followed by `decompose_transformation`, `extract_transformation_rules`, and ends with `apply_transformation`, with `call_llm` being a helper function for all the prior functions.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided information:\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT: Grid Transformation AI System\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal critical issues:\n\n*   **Sample 1:**  The system outputs a grid with some correct transformations (4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 appear), but it doesn't correctly apply the transformations across the entire grid, and also includes a 0. It seems to be recognizing *some* of the input values, but not understanding their context within the overall transformation pattern.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system outputs a grid filled entirely with the number '1'. This strongly suggests an over-generalization problem where the system defaults to a trivial output when it can't discern the pattern.\n*   **Sample 3:** The system outputs a grid filled mostly with the number '3', but introduces '7's in specific locations. Again, this indicates a *partial* understanding of the patterns, or an attempt at transformation that isn't fully realized across the entire grid.\n\nThese output patterns confirm the weaknesses highlighted in the error analysis report. The system struggles to consistently apply transformations and often resorts to outputting a grid of a single value.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a *very* limited capability in grid transformation tasks.  It can identify the task type (grid manipulation) and format the output correctly (JSON grid), but it fundamentally fails to learn and apply the transformation rules from the training data. Accuracy is low (33%), reflecting this failure. The system demonstrates some potential for partial transformations, but lacks the consistency and precision needed for practical use.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:**  Successfully generates a grid-like structure in JSON format.\n*   **Task Identification:**  Correctly recognizes the task as a grid-based transformation.\n*   **Partial Transformation Recognition:** Is able to recognize *some* elements of the input grid, and produce *some* transformations.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The primary weakness is the inability to accurately recognize and replicate patterns in the grid transformations.\n*   **Constraint Handling & Extrapolation:**  Fails to extrapolate rules and constraints from the training data and apply them to unseen input.\n*   **Over-Generalization:**  Frequently defaults to simplistic outputs when complex patterns are encountered.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition.** Without significant improvements in this area, the system will continue to generate inaccurate and trivial solutions. The secondary focus is **Contextual Awareness** and **Extrapolation**.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Layers:** Incorporate convolutional layers at the beginning of the neural network architecture.  These layers are specifically designed to extract spatial features from grid-like data. Focus on small kernel sizes (e.g., 3x3) to capture local patterns.\n2.  **Introduce Pairwise Loss Function:** Develop a loss function that penalizes the model when the relationship between pairs of cells in the input and output grids is inconsistent with the training data. For example, you could train the model to predict the difference between neighboring cells in the output grid, given the difference between corresponding cells in the input grid.\n3.  **Curriculum Learning:** Implement a curriculum learning strategy. Start with simpler transformation patterns (e.g., shifting all values by a constant) and gradually increase the complexity of the transformations in the training data.\n4.  **Increase Training Data Diversity:** Generate synthetic training data that covers a wider range of transformation patterns.  This should include patterns based on:\n    *   Local cell values.\n    *   Relative cell positions.\n    *   Combination of different numerical values.\n5.  **Introduce Positional Encoding:** Incorporate positional encoding to explicitly inform the model about the row and column indices of each cell in the grid. This can help the model learn position-dependent transformations.\n6. **Augment the Training Data:** Employ data augmentation techniques such as rotating, flipping, shifting, and adding noise to the input grids. This can help the model generalize to variations in the input data.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data and the execution analysis, the capability trend is currently **stable at a low level of performance.** The system consistently fails to accurately solve the task, indicating no significant improvement. Further iterations *must* incorporate the recommendations above to observe any upward trend.\n",

The system demonstrates some potential for partial transformations, but lacks the consistency and precision needed for practical use.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:**  Successfully generates a grid-like structure in JSON format.\n*   **Task Identification:**  Correctly recognizes the task as a grid-based transformation.\n*   **Partial Transformation Recognition:** Is able to recognize *some* elements of the input grid, and produce *some* transformations.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The primary weakness is the inability to accurately recognize and replicate patterns in the grid transformations.\n*   **Constraint Handling & Extrapolation:**  Fails to extrapolate rules and constraints from the training data and apply them to unseen input.\n*   **Over-Generalization:**  Frequently defaults to simplistic outputs when complex patterns are encountered.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition.** Without significant improvements in this area, the system will continue to generate inaccurate and trivial solutions. The secondary focus is **Contextual Awareness** and **Extrapolation**.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Layers:** Incorporate convolutional layers at the beginning of the neural network architecture.  These layers are specifically designed to extract spatial features from grid-like data. Focus on small kernel sizes (e.g., 3x3) to capture local patterns.\n2.  **Introduce Pairwise Loss Function:** Develop a loss function that penalizes the model when the relationship between pairs of cells in the input and output grids is inconsistent with the training data. For example, you could train the model to predict the difference between neighboring cells in the output grid, given the difference between corresponding cells in the input grid.\n3.  **Curriculum Learning:** Implement a curriculum learning strategy. Start with simpler transformation patterns (e.g., shifting all values by a constant) and gradually increase the complexity of the transformations in the training data.\n4.  **Increase Training Data Diversity:** Generate synthetic training data that covers a wider range of transformation patterns.  This should include patterns based on:\n    *   Local cell values.\n    *   Relative cell positions.\n    *   Combination of different numerical values.\n5.  **Introduce Positional Encoding:** Incorporate positional encoding to explicitly inform the model about the row and column indices of each cell in the grid. This can help the model learn position-dependent transformations.\n6. **Augment the Training Data:** Employ data augmentation techniques such as rotating, flipping, shifting, and adding noise to the input grids. This can help the model generalize to variations in the input data.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data and the execution analysis, the capability trend is currently **stable at a low level of performance.** The system consistently fails to accurately solve the task, indicating no significant improvement. Further iterations *must* incorporate the recommendations above to observe any upward trend.\n"

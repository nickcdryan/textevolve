  "approach_summary": "This script addresses grid transformation problems by identifying the transformation pattern, applying it, and verifying the result using LLMs. The problem is decomposed into identifying the transformation type, applying the transformation, and function testing. The agent roles include an expert in recognizing grid transformation patterns, an expert in applying grid transformations, and a grid transformation expert for testing. The script uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini LLM, `identify_transformation_type` to determine the grid transformation, `apply_transformation` to apply the identified transformation, and `function_test` to verify the result. The workflow is: `main` calls `identify_transformation_type` to determine the transformation, extracts the input grid, calls `apply_transformation` to transform the grid, and then calls `function_test` to verify the output.",

The prompt requires to find what colors are present in *all* rows. However, the code provides colors that are present in *each* row.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates some initial capabilities in code generation and problem decomposition. However, it struggles significantly with pattern recognition, generalizing from examples, and ensuring the accuracy of its output. The accuracy score of 0.33 reflects this weakness. The system is able to generate *a* solution, but is not able to verify *that* solution. It lacks the verification step.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** Ability to produce syntactically correct Python code.\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** Attempts to break down the task into smaller steps.\n*   **Grid Manipulation (Partial):** Basic grid manipulation (copying, accessing elements) works.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:**  Struggles to identify and apply the correct transformations.\n*   **Accurate Implementation and Verification:** Even with a partially correct pattern identified, the code execution/output doesn't always match the intended result.\n*   **Incorrect Interpretation of Prompt:** The system may not be able to accurately interpret complex prompts and correctly understand the relationship between the input and output.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**. Without a strong understanding of the underlying patterns, the system will continue to generate incorrect code, regardless of its ability to produce syntactically valid programs. Improving the interpretation of the prompt should be a key focus.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Focus on few-shot learning.** The model is missing something when it is attempting to derive the prompt answer. A key focus should be few-shot prompting, where multiple examples are provided and the agent is asked to reason why the example answers are correct.\n2.  **Implement a Feature Extraction and Pattern Encoding Module:**  Before generating code, the system should analyze the input and output grids in the training examples to extract relevant features. These features should be encoded in a way that allows the system to reason about the relationships between them. Examples of features to extract:\n    *   Row and column statistics (e.g., number of unique values, mean, standard deviation)\n    *   Spatial relationships between elements (e.g., adjacency, relative positions)\n    *   Color distributions (e.g., number of distinct colors, frequency of each color)\n    *   For example, a possible format could be:\n        `[Feature(type=\"row_pattern\", row=0, pattern=[1,1,1,1,1]), Feature(type=\"row_pattern\", row=1, pattern=[2,2,2,2,2])]`\n3.  **Introduce a Rule Induction and Reasoning Engine:** Use the extracted features to infer the transformation rules. This could involve using techniques like:\n    *   Decision trees or rule-based systems to learn explicit rules from the training data.\n    *   Neural networks to learn implicit mappings between features and transformations.\n    *   Implement some form of **reasoning** over the extracted features and inferred rules. This allows the system to explain *why* a particular transformation is being applied.\n    *   Example output from reasoning: `\"Rows with pattern [1,1,1,1,1] are replaced by rows with pattern [2,2,2,2,2].\"`\n4.  **Develop a Code Verification Loop:** After generating the code, the system should:\n    *   **Simulate code execution:** Run the generated code on the training examples to check if the output matches the expected output.\n    *   **Generate test cases:** Create new test cases that cover a variety of possible inputs and transformations.\n    *   **Analyze discrepancies:** If the output doesn't match the expected output, analyze the discrepancies to identify the source of the error and refine the transformation rules.\n    *   Include print statements and intermediate outputs so that discrepancies can be easily identified\n5.  **Fine-tune on more diverse examples:** Expanding the training dataset to include a wider range of grid transformations will help the system generalize better to new inputs.\n6.  **Implement Attention Mechanisms:** If using a neural network-based approach, incorporate attention mechanisms that allow the system to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when making predictions. This can help the system identify subtle patterns that might otherwise be missed.\n7.  **Prompt Engineering for Output Format:** Provide clear and explicit instructions in the prompt regarding the desired output format. This can help reduce errors related to incorrect output formatting.\n8.  **Re-evaluate unique colour approach.** Determine why the agent fails in this case, and debug the training/reasoning appropriately.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are **stable but low**. Without significant improvements in pattern recognition and generalization, the system is unlikely to achieve higher accuracy. The trend is potentially declining, as the current approach seems to have reached its limit. The proposed improvements should shift the trend towards improvement.\n",

This allows the system to explain *why* a particular transformation is being applied.\n    *   Example output from reasoning: `\"Rows with pattern [1,1,1,1,1] are replaced by rows with pattern [2,2,2,2,2].\"`\n4.  **Develop a Code Verification Loop:** After generating the code, the system should:\n    *   **Simulate code execution:** Run the generated code on the training examples to check if the output matches the expected output.\n    *   **Generate test cases:** Create new test cases that cover a variety of possible inputs and transformations.\n    *   **Analyze discrepancies:** If the output doesn't match the expected output, analyze the discrepancies to identify the source of the error and refine the transformation rules.\n    *   Include print statements and intermediate outputs so that discrepancies can be easily identified\n5.  **Fine-tune on more diverse examples:** Expanding the training dataset to include a wider range of grid transformations will help the system generalize better to new inputs.\n6.  **Implement Attention Mechanisms:** If using a neural network-based approach, incorporate attention mechanisms that allow the system to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when making predictions. This can help the system identify subtle patterns that might otherwise be missed.\n7.  **Prompt Engineering for Output Format:** Provide clear and explicit instructions in the prompt regarding the desired output format. This can help reduce errors related to incorrect output formatting.\n8.  **Re-evaluate unique colour approach.** Determine why the agent fails in this case, and debug the training/reasoning appropriately.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are **stable but low**. Without significant improvements in pattern recognition and generalization, the system is unlikely to achieve higher accuracy. The trend is potentially declining, as the current approach seems to have reached its limit. The proposed improvements should shift the trend towards improvement.\n"

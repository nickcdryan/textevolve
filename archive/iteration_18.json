  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by decomposing the process into feature extraction, transformation selection, and transformation application, using the Gemini LLM for each step. It employs a multi-example chain-of-thought approach and includes a validation step to ensure the transformed grid is reasonable. The script utilizes `solve_grid_transformation` to orchestrate the process, calling `call_llm` with prompts generated for feature extraction, transformation selection, transformation application, and result validation, with the system instruction being consistent throughout. The overall workflow involves extracting features from the problem text, selecting the most appropriate transformation based on these features, applying the selected transformation to generate a new grid, and finally validating the generated grid for correctness.",

The system's understanding of underlying transformation logic needs significant improvement.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal the following issues:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system correctly identifies the conditional replacement of '0' with '3' based on the position of '8'. However, the placement of '3' is inaccurate and incomplete. The output is identical to the input, indicating no actual transformation took place.

The resulting grid exhibits a **partial and inconsistent application** of the intended transformation rule. The 3s are placed in the wrong location.\n*   **Sample 2:** While the system recognizes the need for compression with shape extraction, the extracted shape's transformation is essentially unchanged from the input. It correctly identifies that the non-zero values are important, but fails to perform any meaningful compression or value substitution.

For instance, track the frequency and context of value transformations in the training data. Use this module to *verify* and correct potential value substitutions *before* they are applied to the output grid.\n2.  **Implement Spatial Relationship Encoding:** Explore methods to represent spatial relationships (e.g., adjacency matrices, relative coordinates) between values in the input grid. This allows the system to understand the spatial context and apply transformations accordingly.  Consider training a separate model to predict the *correct* spatial application of a transformation, given the input grid and the desired transformation rule.\n3.  **Introduce Attention Mechanisms for Transformation Application:** Use attention mechanisms to direct the system's focus to the most relevant regions of the input grid when applying transformations. This can help prevent errors based on irrelevant or misleading information.  For example, the attention mechanism could focus on the immediate neighbors of an '8' when deciding where to place a '3' in Sample 0.\n4.  **Augment the Training Data:** Significantly increase the number and diversity of training examples. Focus on examples that highlight the nuances of value mappings and spatial relationships. Include both positive and negative examples to train the system to distinguish between correct and incorrect transformations.\n5.  **Implement unit tests:** Ensure proper unit tests are in place.\n6.  **Create a dedicated module for solution verification:** This would add a layer to reduce errors.\n7.  **Improve prompt engineering**: The model is extracting the correct features and transformations, so this could also be a possible solution.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are **stable but critically low**.

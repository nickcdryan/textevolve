  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to answer questions by decomposing them into sub-questions, extracting relevant information, and synthesizing a final answer. It leverages LLMs with specific roles (question decomposer, information extraction expert, answer synthesis expert) at each stage, and includes verification steps to ensure validity. The core functions are `decompose_question` (breaks down the initial question), `extract_information` (gathers relevant data based on sub-questions), `synthesize_answer` (creates the final answer), and `call_llm` (interacts with the Gemini model). The overall workflow involves decomposing the question, extracting information related to the sub-questions, and then synthesizing these details into a comprehensive answer, with validation checks at each step to ensure accuracy.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Coming off their win over the Steelers, the Patriots stayed at home for an AFC East rematch with the 3-10 Jets. The Patriots punted on their first drive of the game, giving the Jets the ball at their own 3-yard line. After a 1-yard Thomas Jones run, Jets quarterback Clemens threw an interception to Eugene Wilson, who returned it for a touchdown. Clemens was hit by Seymour and suffered an ankle injury on the play and did not return to the game. Wilson also became the Patriots' 21st player to score a touchdown on the season, tying an NFL record set by the Denver Broncos in 2000 and Los Angeles Rams in 1987. On their ensuing possession, the Jets gained 49&#160;yards on an option play to running back Leon Washington, but then failed a fourth down conversion from the Patriots' 17-yard line. With 6:36 remaining in the first quarter, the Patriots began a drive that ended 17 plays later, in the 2nd quarter, on a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. After a Jets punt, the Patriots moved the ball to their own 40-yard line when a Chris Hanson punt attempt was blocked by David Bowens and returned for a touchdown to cut the Patriots' lead to 10-7. On the Jets' next possession, Washington blocked a Graham punt attempt to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 3-yard line. A 1-yard Maroney touchdown run a play later gave the Patriots a 17-7 lead going into halftime. Gostkowski's extra point, his 67th of the season, broke Uwe von Schamann's single-season record of 66 with the Miami Dolphins in 1984. A Jets punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line early in the third quarter. After two Maroney rushes for a total of 5&#160;yards, a Brady pass on third down intended to Moss was intercepted by Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. The Jets moved into the red zone, but were driven back on a Thomas Jones run for a 1-yard loss and a delay of game penalty. On third down, Pennington completed a 10-yard pass to Baker, who then fumbled. Wilson recovered it for the Patriots, but a subsequent exchange of punts kept the third quarter scoreless. Another Hanson punt began the fourth quarter, giving the Jets the ball from their own 15-yard line. The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&#160;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots' 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots' lead to 17-10 on a 33-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Patriots' ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&#160;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets' next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20-10 win. It gave the Patriots a 14-0 record, tying them with the 1972 Miami Dolphins for the best record to start a season. The win also clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the Patriots.\n\nQUESTION: What was the losing score?",

The first settlements discovered date from the Copper Age. The area was later under the control of the Ligures, later replaced by the Celts. The latter were in turn conquered by the Romans, who called the lake Verbanus Lacus or Lacus Maximus. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the lake was under different dominations. Most of the current settlements originated in the Middle Ages, when the lake was under the Della Torre, Visconti, the Borromeo and Habsburg families. Methane was first discovered and isolated by Alessandro Volta as he analysed marsh gas from Lake Maggiore, between 1776 and 1778. In 1936, a Bugatti Type 22 Brescia Roadster, built 1925, was sunk in the lake by employees of Z\u00fcrich architect Marco Schmucklerski, when Swiss custom officials investigated whether he had paid taxes on the car. The Bugatti was attached to an iron chain making it possible to recover it once the investigation was over, yet that never happened. When the chain corroded, the car sunk to the lake bed, where it was rediscovered on 18 August 1967 by local diver Ugo Pillon and became a favourite target for divers thereafter. When one of the divers, Damiano Tamagni, was killed in a hold-up on 1 February 2008, his friends from the Ascona divers' club decided to lift and sell the carwreck to raise funds for a yet to be created foundation named after the victim.

The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April. The escape of the leadership embittered many Reds, and thousands of them tried to flee to Russia, but most of the refugees were encircled by White and German troops.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Cincinnati scored on its first possession, when Andy Dalton threw to A. J. Green for an 82-yard touchdown. The Lions tied it later in the first quarter on a 3-yard TD pass from Matthew Stafford to Brandon Pettigrew. A 36-yard field goal by David Akers gave the Lions a 10-7 second quarter lead.  But late in the quarter, Akers had a 34-yard field goal attempt blocked by Carlos Dunlap, which the Bengals returned all the way to the Lions 40 yard line despite fumbling during the return. That set up a 12-yard TD strike from Andy Dalton to Marvin Jones just before the first half closed, giving Cincinnati a 14-10 lead. The teams exchanged TD passes in the third quarter. First, Dalton hit Tyler Eifert for a 32-yard TD, and Stafford followed shortly after with a 27-yard TD toss to Calvin Johnson. Mike Nugent connected on a 48-yard field goal late in the third to put the Bengals up 24-17.  The Lions tied the game at 24 in the fourth quarter, when Calvin Johnson leaped up and beat three Bengals defenders in the end zone on a 50-yard pass from Matthew Stafford. After the game, Stafford called Johnson's play \"one of the best catches I have ever seen.\" Late in the fourth quarter, a punt by the Bengals Kevin Huber pinned the Lions at their own 6 yard line. Detroit attempted to kill enough clock to get the game to overtime, but could only gain one first down and 17 yards. Detroit punter Sam Martin then shanked a punt that netted only 28 yards before going out of bounds at the Cincinnati 49 with 26 seconds left in the game. Three plays and 15 yards later, Mike Nugent boomed a 54-yard field goal as time expired to give the Bengals a 27-24 victory. The aerial attack for both teams produced big numbers.  Andy Dalton was 24-of-34 for 372 yards and 3 touchdowns, while Matthew Stafford was 28-of-51 for 357 yards and 3 scores.  A. J.

      "original_passage": "Coming off their win over the Steelers, the Patriots stayed at home for an AFC East rematch with the 3-10 Jets. The Patriots punted on their first drive of the game, giving the Jets the ball at their own 3-yard line. After a 1-yard Thomas Jones run, Jets quarterback Clemens threw an interception to Eugene Wilson, who returned it for a touchdown. Clemens was hit by Seymour and suffered an ankle injury on the play and did not return to the game. Wilson also became the Patriots' 21st player to score a touchdown on the season, tying an NFL record set by the Denver Broncos in 2000 and Los Angeles Rams in 1987. On their ensuing possession, the Jets gained 49&#160;yards on an option play to running back Leon Washington, but then failed a fourth down conversion from the Patriots' 17-yard line. With 6:36 remaining in the first quarter, the Patriots began a drive that ended 17 plays later, in the 2nd quarter, on a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. After a Jets punt, the Patriots moved the ball to their own 40-yard line when a Chris Hanson punt attempt was blocked by David Bowens and returned for a touchdown to cut the Patriots' lead to 10-7. On the Jets' next possession, Washington blocked a Graham punt attempt to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 3-yard line. A 1-yard Maroney touchdown run a play later gave the Patriots a 17-7 lead going into halftime. Gostkowski's extra point, his 67th of the season, broke Uwe von Schamann's single-season record of 66 with the Miami Dolphins in 1984. A Jets punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line early in the third quarter. After two Maroney rushes for a total of 5&#160;yards, a Brady pass on third down intended to Moss was intercepted by Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. The Jets moved into the red zone, but were driven back on a Thomas Jones run for a 1-yard loss and a delay of game penalty. On third down, Pennington completed a 10-yard pass to Baker, who then fumbled. Wilson recovered it for the Patriots, but a subsequent exchange of punts kept the third quarter scoreless. Another Hanson punt began the fourth quarter, giving the Jets the ball from their own 15-yard line. The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&#160;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots' 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots' lead to 17-10 on a 33-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Patriots' ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&#160;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets' next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20-10 win. It gave the Patriots a 14-0 record, tying them with the 1972 Miami Dolphins for the best record to start a season. The win also clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the Patriots.",

      "original_passage": "The first archaeological findings around the lake belong to nomadic people living in the area in prehistoric types. The first settlements discovered date from the Copper Age. The area was later under the control of the Ligures, later replaced by the Celts. The latter were in turn conquered by the Romans, who called the lake Verbanus Lacus or Lacus Maximus. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the lake was under different dominations. Most of the current settlements originated in the Middle Ages, when the lake was under the Della Torre, Visconti, the Borromeo and Habsburg families. Methane was first discovered and isolated by Alessandro Volta as he analysed marsh gas from Lake Maggiore, between 1776 and 1778. In 1936, a Bugatti Type 22 Brescia Roadster, built 1925, was sunk in the lake by employees of Z\u00fcrich architect Marco Schmucklerski, when Swiss custom officials investigated whether he had paid taxes on the car. The Bugatti was attached to an iron chain making it possible to recover it once the investigation was over, yet that never happened. When the chain corroded, the car sunk to the lake bed, where it was rediscovered on 18 August 1967 by local diver Ugo Pillon and became a favourite target for divers thereafter. When one of the divers, Damiano Tamagni, was killed in a hold-up on 1 February 2008, his friends from the Ascona divers' club decided to lift and sell the carwreck to raise funds for a yet to be created foundation named after the victim. The remains of the Bugatti were recovered on 12 July 2009. The sale took place at the Retro Mobile classic car exhibition in Paris on 23 January 2010. It was sold for \u20ac260,500.",

      "original_passage": "On 8 April 1918, after the defeat in Tampere and the German army intervention, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Vyborg. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April. The escape of the leadership embittered many Reds, and thousands of them tried to flee to Russia, but most of the refugees were encircled by White and German troops. In the Lahti area they surrendered on 1-2 May. The long Red caravans included women and children, who experienced a desperate, chaotic escape with severe losses due to White attacks. The scene was described as a \"road of tears\" for the Reds, but for the Whites, the sight of long, enemy caravans heading east was a victorious moment. The Red Guards' last strongholds between the Kouvola and Kotka area fell by 5 May, after the Battle of Ahvenkoski. The war of 1918 ended on 15 May 1918, when the Whites took over Fort Ino, a Russian coastal artillery base on the Karelian Isthmus, from the Russian troops. White Finland and General Mannerheim celebrated the victory with a large military parade in Helsinki on 16 May 1918. The Red Guards had been defeated. The initially pacifist Finnish labour movement had lost the Civil War, several military leaders committed suicide and a majority of the Reds were sent to prison camps. The Vaasa Senate returned to Helsinki on 4 May 1918, but the capital was under the control of the German army. White Finland had become a protectorate of the German Empire and General R\u00fcdiger von der Goltz was called \"the true Regent of Finland\". No armistice or peace negotiations were carried out between the Whites and Reds and an official peace treaty to end the Finnish Civil War was never signed.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and improvement suggestions:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/5)\n*   Error samples: 5/5\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:** (As Provided)\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly show a consistent and critical error: `module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'`. This error occurs repeatedly during the question decomposition stage, preventing the system from progressing further. The consistent nature of this error across all samples points to a systemic issue related to the Gemini API setup rather than any problem with the specific questions being asked. The system attempts question decomposition multiple times (3 attempts), each failing. The error messages confirm that the issue originates from the API configuration, indicating problems with library installation, credentials, or environment setup.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system, in its current state, has **very limited capability**. Its core functionality is severely hampered by its inability to configure and utilize the Gemini API. While the design incorporates potentially useful modularity (question decomposition), this strength is currently unrealized. The system's ability to perform information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, verification, and decision-making is non-existent due to the initial API failure. Overall the system is non-functional at present.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Modular Design (Potential):** The intended modular design, particularly the question decomposition stage, is a strength to maintain. This approach is beneficial for tackling complex questions by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components.\n*   **API Integration (Potential):** The system's attempt to integrate a powerful LLM like Gemini is a strength in concept. Leveraging LLMs for question answering is a promising approach.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **API Configuration/Access:** The *most critical* weakness is the inability to configure and reliably access the Gemini API. This is a fundamental blocker that prevents any further processing.\n*   **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** While the system detects the error, it doesn't provide enough context or recovery mechanisms. More detailed error messages and logging would be valuable.\n*   **No Fallback Mechanism:** The absence of a fallback mechanism when the API or question decomposition fails makes the system brittle.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **API Integration and Configuration**. Specifically, ensuring a reliable and robust connection to the Gemini API. Without this, no other improvements will be effective.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Immediate API Verification:**\n    *   **Verify Installation:** Double-check the `google.genai` library installation. Use `pip list` or `conda list` to confirm it's present in the correct environment.\n    *   **Check Credentials:** Ensure the Gemini API credentials (API key) are correctly set as environment variables (e.g., `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) or securely passed into the `configure` function (if not using environment variables).\n    *   **Code Review:** Review the code to pinpoint where the `google.genai.configure()` call is made and verify the parameters passed to it. Ensure they match the API's expected format.\n2.  **Implement API Health Check:**\n    *   Add a preliminary API health check *before* attempting question decomposition. This check should attempt a simple API call (e.g., a ping or echo request) to confirm API availability. This prevents cascading failures.\n3.  **Enhanced Error Handling & Logging:**\n    *   **Detailed Logging:** Log the exact exception and traceback when the API call fails. This provides more information for debugging. `import traceback; traceback.print_exc()` can be helpful.\n    *   **Specific Error Messages:** Provide more informative error messages to the user (or in the logs) describing the nature of the API failure (e.g., \"Invalid API Key,\" \"API Unavailable,\" \"Connection Error\").\n4.  **Basic Fallback Strategy:**\n    *   Implement a simple keyword-based search or pattern-matching as a temporary fallback if the API is unavailable. While it won't be as accurate as Gemini, it's better than no response at all.\n5.  **Add print statements**: To understand how the program is proceeding add `print()` statements at the beginning of each function and important steps in the logic of the program.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **declining rapidly**. The system is non-functional. Addressing the API issue is critical to reverse this trend. Once the API connectivity is established, future iterations can focus on refining the question decomposition, information extraction, and solution generation capabilities.\n",

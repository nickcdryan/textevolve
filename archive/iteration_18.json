  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions, incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning and verification. The problem is decomposed into question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification, each handled by a distinct LLM prompt. Each stage utilizes the `call_llm` function with specific system instructions to guide the LLM's role as an expert in that stage. The workflow begins with `main` calling `analyze_question`, which then calls `extract_relevant_passage`, followed by `generate_answer` and finally `verify_answer`, with each function passing its output to the next, and error handling at each step.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Sporadic and isolated outbursts by Tibetans against the Chinese continued especially during the unrest between September 1987 until March 1989 in the Tibetan areas of the PRC. But it wasn't until 2008 that a large-scale and coordinated uprising erupted coinciding with international protests accompanying the Olympics torch relay that would end in Beijing where the 2008 Summer Olympics were held. What originally began as an annual observance of Tibetan Uprising Day turned into street protests by large numbers of monks from various monasteries for several days. Crowd control and arrests escalated the tensions eventually setting off a riot by thousands of Tibetans in the Ramoche section of Lhasa on March 14, 2008. When the police fled the scene, rioters looted and burned more than 1200 Chinese shops, offices, and residences and set fire to nearly 100 vehicles. In the end, an estimated 22 were dead and 325 injured, mostly Han. Total damage was estimated at $40 million USD. Eventually the paramilitary People's Armed Police were sent in and 50-100 Tibetan rioters were killed before things quieted down. Meanwhile, in the Gansu Province, a demonstration by 400 monks were met with force that ignited riots by more than 5000 Tibetans who again burned down the establishments of local Han and Hui people before security forces arrived.\n\nQUESTION: How many years did the period of unrest in the Tibetan areas of the PRC last?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Looking to bounce back from a heartbreaking loss the previous week, the Patriots played a wild back-and-forth game against the rival Jets in what would be their only overtime contest of the season. The Patriots marched deep into their own territory on the opening drive of the game, but were forced to punt. The Jets responded with an 11 play, 75-yard drive, aided by a defensive holding penalty on Ras-I Dowling giving the Jets a first down, and scoring on a Shonn Greene 1-yard touchdown run. Devin McCourty returned the ensuing kickoff 104 yards for a touchdown. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots raced 58 yards in 7 plays, scoring on Brady's 17-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, taking a 14-7 lead. Two possessions later, Mark Sanchez fumbled the snap and kicked the ball out of the end zone for a safety, increasing the Patriots lead to 16-7 early in the second quarter. After a Patriots punt, the Jets drove to the Patriots 36, but Sanchez was intercepted by Dennard at the Patriots 2 for no gain. The Patriots drove to the Jets 45, but punted, as well. Starting at their own 5, the Jets raced to the Patriots 36, and Nick Folk nailed a 54-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 16-10 at halftime. Joe McKnight returned the kickoff 37 yards to the Jets 32. With the decent starting field position, the Jets drove 66 yards to the Patriots 3, but the Patriots defense stiffened and forced the Jets to settle for Folk's 21-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to just 16-13. The Patriots countered on their next drive, putting together a 15 play, 67-yard drive in just under six minutes, converting three third-downs, and scoring on a two-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 23-13. Two possessions later, the Jets engineered a 14 play, 91-yard drive, converting three third-downs, scoring on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Sanchez to Dustin Keller, trimming the deficit to 23-20. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets marched to the Patriots 25 and Folk tied the game with his 43-yard field goal. The situation turned to disaster for the Patriots when Lex Hilliard forced McCourty to fumble and Asher Allen recovered at the Patriots 18. Hightower sacked Sanchez for a 10-yard loss on third down and Folk kicked a 43-yard field goal, giving the Jets a 26-23 lead. Starting at their own 21, the Patriots marched 54 yards to the Jets 25 and Gostkowski tied the game on his 43-yard field goal as time expired. The Patriots received their opening kickoff of overtime, marching 54 yards to the Jets 30 and Gostkowski gave the Patriots the 29-26 lead on a 48-yard field goal. The Jets reached their own 40, but on 2nd-and-10, Sanchez was sacked by Ninkovich and Jermaine Cunningham with Ninkovich recovering and sealing the win.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Iran's telecommunication network enjoys the highest growth rate in the Middle East. One of the indicators that clearly illustrates this growth rate is the increase in the number of installed main lines. In 1978 there were only about 850,000 fixed lines installed in Iran. This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989. One of the objectives of the first five-year development plan (1989-1994) for the telecommunication sector was to add one million new fixed lines to the network. However, due to the establishment and expansion of many low-capacity and high-capacity exchanges, the actual growth rate that was achieved was considerably higher. In fact more than 3.1 million new main lines were installed during the period of the first five-year plan. Four million new lines were expected to be added by the end of the second five-year plan (1994-1999), which would increase the number of installed main lines to about 9,510,000 fixed lines. Irans telecom market, which generated an estimated $9.1 billion in 2010 (of which 2/3 from \"voice\" mobile-phone and 1/10 from \"data\" mobile-phone services), has been growing significantly, especially its mobile-phone business. As of 2010, Iran had about 66 million mobile-phone subscribers covering about 70% of the population.

The Cowboys dominated the first half, putting the Lions in a big hole for the second straight week. First came a 25-yard touchdown catch by Dez Bryant. In the second quarter, Bryant scored again on a 6-yard touchdown catch. Dallas added more points with a 41-yard field goal by Dan Bailey. The Lions then got their only points of the first half with a 33-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Cowboys responded with a 35-yard field goal just before halftime. After the break, Dallas added more points with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, putting them up 27-3.

Veterans of the American Civil War recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about. The Great Reunion of 1913, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, was attended by more than 50,000 Union and Confederate veterans, and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including Pickett's Charge. During the early twentieth century, historical reenactment became very popular in Russia with reenactments of the Siege of Sevastopol  , the Battle of Borodino  in St Petersburg and the Taking of Azov  in Voronezh in 1918. In 1920, there was a reenactment of the 1917 Storming of the Winter Palace on the third anniversary of the event. This reenactment inspired the scenes in Sergei Eisenstein's film October: Ten Days That Shook the World. Large scale reenactments began to be regularly held at the Royal Tournament, Aldershot Tattoo in the 1920s and 30s. A spectacular recreation of the Siege of Namur, an important military engagement of the Nine Years' War, was staged in 1934 as part of 6-day long show.

But it wasn't until 2008 that a large-scale and coordinated uprising erupted coinciding with international protests accompanying the Olympics torch relay that would end in Beijing where the 2008 Summer Olympics were held. What originally began as an annual observance of Tibetan Uprising Day turned into street protests by large numbers of monks from various monasteries for several days. Crowd control and arrests escalated the tensions eventually setting off a riot by thousands of Tibetans in the Ramoche section of Lhasa on March 14, 2008. When the police fled the scene, rioters looted and burned more than 1200 Chinese shops, offices, and residences and set fire to nearly 100 vehicles. In the end, an estimated 22 were dead and 325 injured, mostly Han. Total damage was estimated at $40 million USD. Eventually the paramilitary People's Armed Police were sent in and 50-100 Tibetan rioters were killed before things quieted down. Meanwhile, in the Gansu Province, a demonstration by 400 monks were met with force that ignited riots by more than 5000 Tibetans who again burned down the establishments of local Han and Hui people before security forces arrived.",

The Patriots marched deep into their own territory on the opening drive of the game, but were forced to punt. The Jets responded with an 11 play, 75-yard drive, aided by a defensive holding penalty on Ras-I Dowling giving the Jets a first down, and scoring on a Shonn Greene 1-yard touchdown run. Devin McCourty returned the ensuing kickoff 104 yards for a touchdown. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots raced 58 yards in 7 plays, scoring on Brady's 17-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, taking a 14-7 lead. Two possessions later, Mark Sanchez fumbled the snap and kicked the ball out of the end zone for a safety, increasing the Patriots lead to 16-7 early in the second quarter. After a Patriots punt, the Jets drove to the Patriots 36, but Sanchez was intercepted by Dennard at the Patriots 2 for no gain. The Patriots drove to the Jets 45, but punted, as well. Starting at their own 5, the Jets raced to the Patriots 36, and Nick Folk nailed a 54-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 16-10 at halftime. Joe McKnight returned the kickoff 37 yards to the Jets 32. With the decent starting field position, the Jets drove 66 yards to the Patriots 3, but the Patriots defense stiffened and forced the Jets to settle for Folk's 21-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to just 16-13. The Patriots countered on their next drive, putting together a 15 play, 67-yard drive in just under six minutes, converting three third-downs, and scoring on a two-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 23-13. Two possessions later, the Jets engineered a 14 play, 91-yard drive, converting three third-downs, scoring on a 7-yard touchdown pass from Sanchez to Dustin Keller, trimming the deficit to 23-20. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Jets marched to the Patriots 25 and Folk tied the game with his 43-yard field goal. The situation turned to disaster for the Patriots when Lex Hilliard forced McCourty to fumble and Asher Allen recovered at the Patriots 18. Hightower sacked Sanchez for a 10-yard loss on third down and Folk kicked a 43-yard field goal, giving the Jets a 26-23 lead. Starting at their own 21, the Patriots marched 54 yards to the Jets 25 and Gostkowski tied the game on his 43-yard field goal as time expired. The Patriots received their opening kickoff of overtime, marching 54 yards to the Jets 30 and Gostkowski gave the Patriots the 29-26 lead on a 48-yard field goal.

One of the indicators that clearly illustrates this growth rate is the increase in the number of installed main lines. In 1978 there were only about 850,000 fixed lines installed in Iran. This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989. One of the objectives of the first five-year development plan (1989-1994) for the telecommunication sector was to add one million new fixed lines to the network. However, due to the establishment and expansion of many low-capacity and high-capacity exchanges, the actual growth rate that was achieved was considerably higher. In fact more than 3.1 million new main lines were installed during the period of the first five-year plan. Four million new lines were expected to be added by the end of the second five-year plan (1994-1999), which would increase the number of installed main lines to about 9,510,000 fixed lines. Irans telecom market, which generated an estimated $9.1 billion in 2010 (of which 2/3 from \"voice\" mobile-phone and 1/10 from \"data\" mobile-phone services), has been growing significantly, especially its mobile-phone business.

The U.S., in an effort to support Yemeni counter-terrorism efforts, has increased their military aid package to Yemen from less than $11 million in 2006 to more than $70 million in 2009, as well as providing up to $121 million for development over the next three years.",

He also holds the all-time postseason record for most starts (42) and innings pitched in the postseason (263). He was the second starting pitcher in history to win three series-clinching games (ALDS, ALCS and World Series) in the same postseason (2009). Derek Lowe did the same in 2004, but with one of the wins in relief, and additionally, Pettitte won the regular season game in which the Yankees clinched the division. When Pettitte started Game 3 of the 2009 World Series, he passed Christy Mathewson and Waite Hoyt, with the second most World Series starts. Whitey Ford is in front with 22 starts. Pettitte has played in 8 different World Series (7 with the Yankees, and 2005 World Series with the Astros), and been on the winning end of 19 postseason series - both of which are tops among active players. Andy Pettittes final postseason appearance was on Saturday, October 13, 2012 which was game one of the 2012 ALCS.

      "original_passage": "In week 4, the Lions traveled south to Arlington, Texas to take on the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys dominated the first half, putting the Lions in a big hole for the second straight week. First came a 25-yard touchdown catch by Dez Bryant. In the second quarter, Bryant scored again on a 6-yard touchdown catch. Dallas added more points with a 41-yard field goal by Dan Bailey. The Lions then got their only points of the first half with a 33-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Cowboys responded with a 35-yard field goal just before halftime. After the break, Dallas added more points with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Jason Witten, putting them up 27-3. The Lions responded with two consecutive defensive touchdowns: first a 34-yard interception return by Bobby Carpenter, then a 56-yard pick-6 by Chris Houston. The Cowboys scored their final points of the game with a 23-yard field goal late in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Lions continued their comeback with a 23-yard touchdown catch by Calvin Johnson. They made it a three-point game with a 51-yard field goal by Jason Hanson, then Romo threw an interception to Stephen Tulloch, and took their first lead of the game late in the final quarter when Calvin Johnson caught his second touchdown of the game from 2 yards out to become only the second player in NFL history to record at least two touchdown catches in 4 straight games (the other to do so is former Vikings receiver Cris Carter). The Lions defense held off Dallas for the win. Like the previous week, the Lions came back and won it in the final moments of the game after being down by a large margin at halftime. This was also the largest comeback the Dallas Cowboys have ever allowed, and it is the largest comeback by a road team in NFL history as the Cowboys were up by 24 in the 3rd quarter. It was the first time the Lions started 4-0 since 1980. This also was its franchise-record fifth straight road win. Ironically, their last game at Dallas saw the Lions lose their franchise-record 26th straight road game.",

      "original_passage": "In 1895, members of the Gloucestershire Engineer Volunteers reenacted their famous stand at Rorke's Drift, 18 years earlier. 25 British soldiers beat back the attack of 75 Zulus at the Grand Military Fete at the Cheltenham Winter Gardens. Veterans of the American Civil War recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about. The Great Reunion of 1913, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg, was attended by more than 50,000 Union and Confederate veterans, and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including Pickett's Charge. During the early twentieth century, historical reenactment became very popular in Russia with reenactments of the Siege of Sevastopol  , the Battle of Borodino  in St Petersburg and the Taking of Azov  in Voronezh in 1918. In 1920, there was a reenactment of the 1917 Storming of the Winter Palace on the third anniversary of the event. This reenactment inspired the scenes in Sergei Eisenstein's film October: Ten Days That Shook the World. Large scale reenactments began to be regularly held at the Royal Tournament, Aldershot Tattoo in the 1920s and 30s. A spectacular recreation of the Siege of Namur, an important military engagement of the Nine Years' War, was staged in 1934 as part of 6-day long show. In America, modern reenacting is thought to have begun during the 1961-1965 Civil War Centennial commemorations. After more than 6,000 reenactors participated in a 125th anniversary event near the original Manassas battlefield, reenacting grew in popularity during the late 1980s and 1990s, and there are today over a hundred Civil War reenactments held each year throughout the country.",

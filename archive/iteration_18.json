  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven knowledge graph traversal approach to answer factual questions. It decomposes the problem into simulated web search, knowledge graph construction, graph traversal, and answer validation, each performed by the LLM acting in a specific role. The `call_llm` function is the core function that interacts with the Gemini model, taking prompts and system instructions as input. The `main` function orchestrates the process: it first generates a search query from the question, then it builds a knowledge graph, traverses it, and validates the answer, using the LLM at each stage.",

It fails to extract the specific end date from the \"Paymaster of the Forces\" information.\n2.  **Lack of Specificity:** The system can provide answers that are too general and not specific enough to answer the question. In the case of the ocean name, the system provided \"the ocean\" rather than the specific \"Pacific Ocean\".\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Limited Reasoning Capability:** The system lacks the capability to perform more complex reasoning, such as inferring the end date of a position or refining a general answer to a specific instance. The reliance on direct matches in the knowledge graph severely limits its problem-solving ability.\n2.  **Insufficient Contextual Understanding:** The system doesn't possess deep enough understanding of the relationships between entities. It needs to be better at understanding nuances in the prompt, like the distinction between \"an ocean\" and \"the Pacific Ocean\".\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Direct Match Dependency:** The system relies heavily on direct matches between the question's keywords and the knowledge graph's entities and relations. If the answer requires any form of inference or more sophisticated reasoning, it fails.\n2.  **Granularity Mismatch:** The system struggles when the required answer is more specific than the available information in the knowledge graph. It defaults to the more general term.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **inability to perform reasoning and inference** beyond direct lookups in the knowledge graph. This limitation restricts the system to only answering questions where the exact answer is explicitly stated, rather than implied or requiring any further processing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Temporal Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to understand and reason about time, including date ranges, durations, and specific dates within a range.\n2.  **Inference Capabilities:** Implement mechanisms for inferring information based on the knowledge graph and the context of the question. This would allow the system to answer questions that require more than just a direct lookup.\n3. **Specificity Refinement:** Add rules or a post-processing step to refine answers and make them as specific as required by the question. This could involve searching for more detailed information within the knowledge graph or using external knowledge sources.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement Temporal Reasoning Module:** Introduce a dedicated module for handling temporal information, including functions for calculating durations, comparing dates, and extracting specific dates from ranges.\n2.  **Enhance Knowledge Graph with Implicit Information:** Augment the knowledge graph with implied relationships and properties. For example, if \"A held position B from date X to date Y\", explicitly add a \"end date\" relation to \"B\" pointing to date Y.\n3.  **Introduce an Inference Engine:** Implement an inference engine that can apply rules and logic to the knowledge graph to derive new facts and answer questions that require reasoning.\n4.  **Add a Specificity Filter:** Implement a post-processing filter that refines the answer to ensure it meets the specificity required by the question. This could involve using a combination of keywords and knowledge graph information to determine the appropriate level of detail.\n5. **Add Print Statements:** Insert `print()` statements into the reasoning process to track and display each step and the corresponding value.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: (Partial success, extracted some relevant information but missed specific end date)\n    *   constraint_handling: (Failed, didn't apply constraints to find the specific last day in office)\n    *   solution_generation: (Failed, generated an incorrect date)\n    *   solution_verification: (Failed, didn't verify the date against the question)\n    *   decision_making: (Failed, selected the incorrect answer)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: (Success, extracted the named after relation)\n    *   constraint_handling: (Failed, didn't constrain the answer to a *specific* ocean)\n    *   solution_generation: (Failed, generated a too-general answer)\n    *   solution_verification: (Failed, didn't verify the specificity of the ocean)\n    *   decision_making: (Failed, selected the incorrect answer)\n",

The system successfully extracted the music director's name from the knowledge graph. This demonstrates accurate knowledge extraction and direct information retrieval.\n*   **Sample 2 (Paymaster of the Forces):** Partially correct but ultimately incorrect. The system retrieved \"August 1783\", which is a date associated with the \"Paymaster of the Forces\", but failed to correctly identify that the user asked for the *specific* end date the position was held. It highlights the system's difficulty in performing accurate constraint handling, as the prompt contained an implicit constraint: \"last day in office\".\n*   **Sample 3 (224 Oceana):** Incorrect. The system extracted \"the ocean\" as what 224 Oceana was named after. The correct answer should have been \"Pacific Ocean\". This demonstrates an inability to select the *specific* ocean the prompt implied; failing constraint handling, solution generation, and solution verification.\n\nOverall, the execution outputs confirm the error analysis. The system excels at direct knowledge retrieval but struggles with reasoning, temporal contexts, and specificity. The reliance on exact matches is a major limitation.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system exhibits basic knowledge graph traversal and information retrieval capabilities. It can answer questions if the answer is directly and explicitly present in the knowledge graph. However, it lacks crucial reasoning abilities, particularly temporal reasoning and the ability to refine general answers into specific ones. This significantly limits its usefulness.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Knowledge Graph Traversal:** The ability to navigate the knowledge graph based on relationships between entities.\n*   **Direct Information Retrieval:** Accurate retrieval when the answer is a direct match within the graph.\n*   **Basic Knowledge Extraction:** The ability to extract relevant relations and entities from user questions.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Temporal Reasoning:** Difficulty processing and reasoning about dates and date ranges.\n*   **Insufficient Reasoning and Inference:** Inability to infer information or derive answers beyond direct lookups.\n*   **Specificity Mismatch:** Inadequate handling of questions requiring specific answers when the knowledge graph only contains general information.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe **single most important capability to focus on improving is reasoning and inference.** Addressing this weakness will unlock the system's ability to answer a much wider range of questions and provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Temporal Reasoning Module:**\n    *   Develop a dedicated module to handle temporal information.\n    *   This module should include functions for date parsing, duration calculation, date comparison, and extracting specific dates from ranges.\n    *   Integrate this module into the knowledge graph traversal process to properly handle temporal relationships.\n2.  **Introduce a Specificity Refinement Step:**\n    *   Add a post-processing step that analyzes the question's wording and context to determine the required level of specificity.\n    *   This step can then search the knowledge graph for more detailed information or leverage external knowledge sources (if available) to refine the answer.\n    *   For example, for the ocean question, the refinement step could identify the association between the numeric name \"224\" and \"Pacific Ocean\".\n3. **Add Detailed Print Statements:**\n    * Insert `print()` statements into the reasoning process to track and display each step and the corresponding value.\n    *  This will improve the ease of debugging.\n4.  **Augment Knowledge Graph with Implied End Dates:**\n    *   When a `held post` relation exists with a start and end date, explicitly add an `end date` relation to the post itself, pointing to the end date.  This makes the temporal information directly accessible for the question.\n    *   Example:  \"Edmund Burke held post Paymaster of the Forces from date X to date Y\" should result in a KG entry: \"Paymaster of the Forces: {relation: end date, target: date Y}\"\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance summary and error analysis, the capabilities appear to be **stable**. The system consistently performs well on direct information retrieval but fails when reasoning is required. Without targeted improvements, the capabilities will likely remain stagnant.\n",

It fails to extract the specific end date from the \"Paymaster of the Forces\" information.\n2.  **Lack of Specificity:** The system can provide answers that are too general and not specific enough to answer the question. In the case of the ocean name, the system provided \"the ocean\" rather than the specific \"Pacific Ocean\".\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Limited Reasoning Capability:** The system lacks the capability to perform more complex reasoning, such as inferring the end date of a position or refining a general answer to a specific instance. The reliance on direct matches in the knowledge graph severely limits its problem-solving ability.\n2.  **Insufficient Contextual Understanding:** The system doesn't possess deep enough understanding of the relationships between entities. It needs to be better at understanding nuances in the prompt, like the distinction between \"an ocean\" and \"the Pacific Ocean\".\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Direct Match Dependency:** The system relies heavily on direct matches between the question's keywords and the knowledge graph's entities and relations. If the answer requires any form of inference or more sophisticated reasoning, it fails.\n2.  **Granularity Mismatch:** The system struggles when the required answer is more specific than the available information in the knowledge graph. It defaults to the more general term.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **inability to perform reasoning and inference** beyond direct lookups in the knowledge graph. This limitation restricts the system to only answering questions where the exact answer is explicitly stated, rather than implied or requiring any further processing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Temporal Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to understand and reason about time, including date ranges, durations, and specific dates within a range.\n2.  **Inference Capabilities:** Implement mechanisms for inferring information based on the knowledge graph and the context of the question. This would allow the system to answer questions that require more than just a direct lookup.\n3. **Specificity Refinement:** Add rules or a post-processing step to refine answers and make them as specific as required by the question. This could involve searching for more detailed information within the knowledge graph or using external knowledge sources.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement Temporal Reasoning Module:** Introduce a dedicated module for handling temporal information, including functions for calculating durations, comparing dates, and extracting specific dates from ranges.\n2.  **Enhance Knowledge Graph with Implicit Information:** Augment the knowledge graph with implied relationships and properties. For example, if \"A held position B from date X to date Y\", explicitly add a \"end date\" relation to \"B\" pointing to date Y.\n3.  **Introduce an Inference Engine:** Implement an inference engine that can apply rules and logic to the knowledge graph to derive new facts and answer questions that require reasoning.\n4.  **Add a Specificity Filter:** Implement a post-processing filter that refines the answer to ensure it meets the specificity required by the question. This could involve using a combination of keywords and knowledge graph information to determine the appropriate level of detail.\n5. **Add Print Statements:** Insert `print()` statements into the reasoning process to track and display each step and the corresponding value.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: (Partial success, extracted some relevant information but missed specific end date)\n    *   constraint_handling: (Failed, didn't apply constraints to find the specific last day in office)\n    *   solution_generation: (Failed, generated an incorrect date)\n    *   solution_verification: (Failed, didn't verify the date against the question)\n    *   decision_making: (Failed, selected the incorrect answer)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: (Success, extracted the named after relation)\n    *   constraint_handling: (Failed, didn't constrain the answer to a *specific* ocean)\n    *   solution_generation: (Failed, generated a too-general answer)\n    *   solution_verification: (Failed, didn't verify the specificity of the ocean)\n    *   decision_making: (Failed, selected the incorrect answer)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample 1 (Music Director):** Correct answer. The system successfully extracted the music director's name from the knowledge graph. This demonstrates accurate knowledge extraction and direct information retrieval.\n*   **Sample 2 (Paymaster of the Forces):** Partially correct but ultimately incorrect. The system retrieved \"August 1783\", which is a date associated with the \"Paymaster of the Forces\", but failed to correctly identify that the user asked for the *specific* end date the position was held. It highlights the system's difficulty in performing accurate constraint handling, as the prompt contained an implicit constraint: \"last day in office\".\n*   **Sample 3 (224 Oceana):** Incorrect. The system extracted \"the ocean\" as what 224 Oceana was named after. The correct answer should have been \"Pacific Ocean\". This demonstrates an inability to select the *specific* ocean the prompt implied; failing constraint handling, solution generation, and solution verification.\n\nOverall, the execution outputs confirm the error analysis. The system excels at direct knowledge retrieval but struggles with reasoning, temporal contexts, and specificity. The reliance on exact matches is a major limitation.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system exhibits basic knowledge graph traversal and information retrieval capabilities. It can answer questions if the answer is directly and explicitly present in the knowledge graph. However, it lacks crucial reasoning abilities, particularly temporal reasoning and the ability to refine general answers into specific ones. This significantly limits its usefulness.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Knowledge Graph Traversal:** The ability to navigate the knowledge graph based on relationships between entities.\n*   **Direct Information Retrieval:** Accurate retrieval when the answer is a direct match within the graph.\n*   **Basic Knowledge Extraction:** The ability to extract relevant relations and entities from user questions.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Temporal Reasoning:** Difficulty processing and reasoning about dates and date ranges.\n*   **Insufficient Reasoning and Inference:** Inability to infer information or derive answers beyond direct lookups.\n*   **Specificity Mismatch:** Inadequate handling of questions requiring specific answers when the knowledge graph only contains general information.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe **single most important capability to focus on improving is reasoning and inference.** Addressing this weakness will unlock the system's ability to answer a much wider range of questions and provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Temporal Reasoning Module:**\n    *   Develop a dedicated module to handle temporal information.\n    *   This module should include functions for date parsing, duration calculation, date comparison, and extracting specific dates from ranges.\n    *   Integrate this module into the knowledge graph traversal process to properly handle temporal relationships.\n2.  **Introduce a Specificity Refinement Step:**\n    *   Add a post-processing step that analyzes the question's wording and context to determine the required level of specificity.\n    *   This step can then search the knowledge graph for more detailed information or leverage external knowledge sources (if available) to refine the answer.\n    *   For example, for the ocean question, the refinement step could identify the association between the numeric name \"224\" and \"Pacific Ocean\".\n3. **Add Detailed Print Statements:**\n    * Insert `print()` statements into the reasoning process to track and display each step and the corresponding value.\n    *  This will improve the ease of debugging.\n4.  **Augment Knowledge Graph with Implied End Dates:**\n    *   When a `held post` relation exists with a start and end date, explicitly add an `end date` relation to the post itself, pointing to the end date.  This makes the temporal information directly accessible for the question.\n    *   Example:  \"Edmund Burke held post Paymaster of the Forces from date X to date Y\" should result in a KG entry: \"Paymaster of the Forces: {relation: end date, target: date Y}\"\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the performance summary and error analysis, the capabilities appear to be **stable**. The system consistently performs well on direct information retrieval but fails when reasoning is required. Without targeted improvements, the capabilities will likely remain stagnant.\n"

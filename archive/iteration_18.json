  "approach_summary": "The script employs a multi-agent iterative refinement approach to solve grid transformation problems. It decomposes the problem into three main stages: rule extraction, rule refinement with reverse transformation checks, and rule application, each handled by a specialized agent. The agents are implemented via specifically-prompted LLM calls. Key functions include `solve_grid_transformation`, which orchestrates the process; `extract_transformation_rule`, which extracts the initial rule; `refine_transformation_rule`, which iteratively refines the rule and introduces a \"reverse transformation\" step to validate the transformations; `apply_transformation`, which applies the refined rule to generate the final output; and `call_llm`, a general-purpose function for interacting with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves extracting an initial transformation rule from the input examples, iteratively refining this rule while validating that it can be reversed, and then applying the final refined rule to the test input grid to produce the transformed grid.",

  "approach_summary": "The script simulates an LLM-driven meeting scheduler by extracting task details (participants, schedules, duration, and constraints) using regex-based parsing, mimicking LLM decomposition. It generates potential time slots within specified work hours and filters them based on participant availability and imposed constraints, simulating LLM reasoning for scheduling. Finally, it proposes the first available time slot that satisfies all conditions.",

  "approach_summary": "The script implements an iterative grid transformation approach, adjusting cell values based on local context and constraints. It decomposes the problem into extracting data, initializing the grid, iterative adjustment using an LLM, and constraint enforcement. An LLM agent adjusts each cell value based on training examples and neighboring values by using the `call_llm` function. The `preprocess_question` function extracts training examples and test input, `initialize_grid` sets up the grid, `adjust_cell_value` modifies cell values using the LLM, and `enforce_constraints` ensures the grid adheres to predefined rules. The overall workflow involves extracting information, initializing the grid, iteratively adjusting cell values with LLM guidance and deterministic constraint enforcement, and returning the final grid.",

The system is not accurately capturing the relationships between input and output grids, leading to vastly different results. The second most critical issue is the inability to generate efficient code, resulting in timeouts when the generated code takes too long to run.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The system's pattern recognition and generalization capabilities need significant improvement. More robust techniques for extracting patterns from limited training examples are needed.\n*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:** The system should be able to generate more efficient code, particularly when manipulating large amounts of data or performing complex operations. The algorithm needs to be efficient to avoid timeouts.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system should be able to generate more appropriate values.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Pattern Extraction:**\n    *   Implement more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms, such as using feature extraction techniques or incorporating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify spatial relationships within the grids.\n    *   Explore techniques like few-shot learning or meta-learning to improve generalization from limited examples.\n    *   Introduce intermediate outputs, such as extracted rules, printed to the console so that the model can be debugged.\n2.  **Code Optimization:**\n    *   Profile the code to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance-critical sections.\n    *   Implement memoization or dynamic programming techniques to avoid redundant computations.\n    *   Use more efficient data structures for grid representation and manipulation.\n3.  **Constraint incorporation:**\n    *   Give the model explicit constraints to only output positive numbers.\n    *   Give the model explicit instructions on which values to output.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID: 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to extract the correct transformation rules.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an incorrect output grid based on the flawed understanding.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed to verify that output follows given constraints.\n*   **Sample ID: 1:**\n    *   solution\\_generation: Timed out, unable to generate a complete solution.\n*   **Sample ID: 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to extract the correct transformation rules.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an incorrect output grid based on the flawed understanding.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**System Overview:** This AI system is designed to analyze and transform grid-based data, learning from a few examples and applying the learned transformations to new input grids. However, its current performance is severely limited by inaccuracies in pattern recognition and algorithmic inefficiencies.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Incorrect Outputs (Samples 0 & 2):** The generated outputs are drastically different from expected outputs. The inclusion of negative numbers in Sample 0 is also a significant deviation from what would be expected, even without explicit instructions.\n*   **Timeout Error (Sample 1):**  The system failed to produce any output within the allocated time for one sample. This suggests a severe performance bottleneck, possibly due to infinite loops or computationally expensive operations.\n*   **Lack of Coherence:**  There's no obvious logical connection between the input and output grids. The transformations seem arbitrary and not grounded in any discernible pattern recognition.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system's overall capabilities are currently very poor. While it demonstrates a basic ability to manipulate grid data, its pattern recognition is flawed, and its code suffers from significant performance issues.\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:**  Extremely weak. The system fails to identify and apply the correct transformation rules.\n*   **Solution Generation:**  Unreliable. The system generates incorrect outputs or fails to generate any output due to timeouts.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Nonexistent. The system ignores implied constraints (e.g., outputting only positive values when appropriate).\n*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:**  Poor. The system's code is prone to timeouts, suggesting inefficient algorithms or code.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Potential for Grid Manipulation:** The system demonstrates the *potential* to manipulate grid data. The attempt to transform the grid (albeit incorrectly) indicates some level of functionality in this area.  This is a *very* weak strength, but worth noting as a base to build upon.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition Accuracy:** The system's inability to accurately identify and apply transformation patterns is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:** The occurrence of timeout errors highlights a severe problem with the system's algorithmic efficiency and scalability.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The model does not incorporate any constraint handling, which affects the quality of the generated results.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition Accuracy.** The system must be able to reliably extract and generalize the transformation patterns from the provided examples. Addressing the efficiency issues are also key.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, prioritized for maximum impact:\n\n1.  **Implement Intermediate Output Debugging:**  Modify the system to print out intermediate calculations or extracted rules to the console *during* execution. This will allow you to understand *how* the system is interpreting the examples and where the pattern recognition is failing.  For example, print the features or rules it has extracted from the training examples.\n2.  **Focus on Simpler Pattern Recognition Algorithms First:** Before implementing complex CNNs, start with simpler, more interpretable pattern recognition algorithms. For example, explicitly code rules based on common grid transformations (e.g., \"If a cell is X, change its neighbors to Y\"). This will provide a solid foundation for more complex methods later.\n3.  **Implement a Timeout-Friendly Code Structure:** Refactor the code to operate in smaller, discrete steps, with timeout checks after each step. This will allow you to interrupt execution before a full timeout occurs and potentially salvage partial results or provide a more informative error message.  Consider using iterative deepening search techniques if the search space is vast.\n4.  **Explicitly Constrain Output:**  Modify the code to explicitly ensure that the output grid contains only non-negative values (if that's the desired behavior).  Add a post-processing step to enforce this constraint.\n5.  **Profiling:** Profile the code to see which areas take the most amount of time to execute.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance (0% accuracy), the capability trend is **declining** or **stable at a very low level.** Significant improvements are needed to shift the trend upwards.\n",

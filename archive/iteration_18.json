  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using the LLM to extract meeting details, find an available time, and verify if the proposed time is valid, each using specific system instructions. The problem is decomposed into three distinct stages: extracting information, finding an available time, and verification, and each stage uses the LLM with a specific persona. The function `call_llm` interfaces with the Gemini API, `extract_meeting_info` extracts relevant details, `find_available_time` proposes a time, and `is_valid_meeting_time` validates the proposal. The `main` function chains these operations together: `extract_meeting_info` -> `find_available_time` -> `is_valid_meeting_time`, with error handling and final output.",

    "capability_report": {
      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of your AI system based on the provided information.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs highlight a consistent issue: the system identifies *potential* time slots based on individual availabilities but fails to synthesize this information into a *definite* meeting time that satisfies everyone, considering preferences. It mostly lists free times without providing a concrete solution. This often leads to ignoring explicit constraints, especially stated preferences. Furthermore, the format of the final answer varies, sometimes providing a single slot, sometimes a list of possibilities, indicating inconsistent solution generation.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic capability for parsing individual calendars and identifying free slots. However, it struggles with the core task of scheduling: finding a *mutually agreeable* time while respecting *all* constraints, particularly preferences. The system's decision-making capabilities are severely limited by its inability to synthesize complex constraint information. The system does not seem to have a reliable verification mechanism, as seen in the failure to exclude Tuesday morning for Timothy when specified.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Individual Availability Identification:** The system can successfully identify available time slots from individual participant calendars.\n*   **Basic Time Slot Overlap Detection:** It attempts to find overlaps between individual availabilities.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Integration Failure:** The system cannot reliably integrate *all* scheduling constraints, especially preferences, into a valid solution.\n*   **Lack of Concrete Solution Generation:** It fails to produce a definite, specific meeting time and day, often listing possibilities instead.\n*   **Inconsistent Output Format:** The output format varies, indicating a lack of consistent solution generation logic.\n*   **No effective constraint satisfaction:** The system does not demonstrate a method for satisfying all constraints (including preferences).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Integration & Solution Generation**. The system needs to reliably synthesize individual availabilities and preferences into a concrete, valid meeting time.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement ReAct Pattern with Constraint Prioritization:**\n\n    *   **Prompt Modification:**  Modify the system prompt to *explicitly* use the ReAct pattern. Within the ReAct cycle:\n        *   **Reason:**  List all constraints, categorizing them as \"hard\" (mandatory) or \"soft\" (preferences). Prioritize \"hard\" constraints.\n        *   **Action:**  Propose a meeting time.\n        *   **Observation:**  Check if *all* \"hard\" constraints are met. If not, modify the proposed time to satisfy the unmet constraint. *Then*, evaluate the satisfaction of \"soft\" constraints. Iterate, balancing preference satisfaction.\n    *   **Example ReAct Cycle:**\n        *   **Reason:** Hard Constraints: Nicholas not available 9:00-9:30, Sara not available 10:00-10:30. Soft Constraints: Timothy prefers not to meet Tuesday before 11:00.\n        *   **Action:** Propose Tuesday at 10:00.\n        *   **Observation:** Hard Constraints Met? NO (Sara is not available 10:00-10:30). Soft Constraints Met? NO (Timothy preference unmet).\n        *   **Action:** Propose Tuesday at 11:00.\n        *   **Observation:** Hard Constraints Met? YES. Soft Constraints Met? YES.\n2.  **Enhanced Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n    *   **Focus on Preference Handling:**  Provide *multiple* few-shot examples in the prompt that *explicitly* demonstrate how preferences are considered and balanced in the final schedule.  Vary the examples to cover different preference types (time of day, day of week, etc.). Show *reasoning* about the trade-offs made.\n    *   **Include Negative Examples:** Include examples of *incorrect* schedules that violate preferences, with explanations of why they are suboptimal.\n    *   **Demonstrate React Steps:** Illustrate the React loop in a few examples with the thought process for satisfying different constraints.\n\n3. **Enforce Output Format Consistency:**\n\n    *   **Output Format Instructions:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to provide the *single* best meeting time in a specific format (e.g., \"Day of Week, Month Day, Year, Time - Time\"). Provide examples of this format in the prompt.\n    *   **Output Verification:** Implement a post-generation Python function that *validates* the output format. If the format is incorrect, trigger a re-generation with a specific error message.\n\n4.  **Specialized Python Function (Constraint Validation):** After the LLM proposes a solution, use a deterministic Python function to *rigorously verify* that the proposed time meets *all* hard constraints. This can catch errors in the LLM's reasoning.  If the constraints are not met, give feedback to the LLM within the ReAct loop.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the error analysis, the capabilities are currently **stable but insufficient**. While the system can perform basic tasks, it consistently fails to meet the core requirements of the scheduling task. The proposed improvements are designed to shift the trend towards **improvement**.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no explicit runtime errors (JSONDecodeError, TypeError, etc.) reported in the provided error case.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n- The system can identify available timeslots for individual participants based on their blocked calendars.\n- The system attempts to find an overlap between the available timeslots of the participants.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n- The system fails to consider all the constraints provided in the problem statement (e.g., Timothy's preference to not meet on Tuesday before 11:00, Mark's avoidance of meetings on Monday and Wednesday).\n- The system doesn't seem to be able to derive a specific valid solution (a specific day and time) by integrating the information from all constraints.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Constraint Handling:** The system struggles to accurately process and integrate all constraints, especially preferences, to narrow down potential timeslots.\n- **Solution Generation:** The system generates a list of availabilities, but doesn't produce a concrete meeting time that satisfies all constraints.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- The system lists available times for each person, but does not generate a specific time and day while obeying preferences.\n- The system often ignores preferences.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is **failure to fully incorporate all scheduling constraints (especially preferences) into a specific, valid meeting time proposal**. It only identifies general availability and doesn't synthesize it into a specific time and day.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Constraint Handling:** Implement more robust parsing and representation of constraints, including preferences. The system should be able to distinguish between hard constraints (mandatory) and soft constraints (preferences).\n- **Solution Generation:** Develop a search or filtering mechanism that iterates through potential timeslots and validates them against all constraints, including preferences.\n- **Solution Verification:** Implement a post-generation verification step that ensures the proposed solution satisfies all constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Enhanced Constraint Parsing:** Modify the prompt to explicitly ask the LLM to extract and categorize \"hard\" and \"soft\" constraints. Then, weight \"soft\" constraints appropriately.\n- **Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm:** After extracting constraints, implement a Python function that systematically searches for timeslots that satisfy all hard constraints and maximizes satisfaction of soft constraints. This may involve iterating through days and times, filtering out invalid times, and scoring remaining options based on preference fulfillment.\n- **ReAct Pattern for Constraint Iteration:** Use a ReAct pattern where:\n    1. **Reason:** Identify unmet constraints.\n    2. **Action:** Adjust the proposed meeting time to address the unmet constraint.\n    3. **Observation:** Check if all constraints are now met. If not, repeat. This forces explicit consideration of each constraint.\n- **Few-Shot Examples with Preference Handling**: Provide several examples in the prompt of how the system should handle preferences in scheduling, demonstrating how the optimal solution considers and balances preferences appropriately.\n- **Dedicated Preference Handling Agent**: Create a specialized \"preference agent\" that takes a proposed schedule and a list of preferences as inputs and returns feedback about potential issues or better alternative schedules.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample 2:**\n    - constraint_handling: Failed\n    - solution_generation: Failed\n    - solution_verification: Failed\n    - decision_making: Failed\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of your AI system based on the provided information.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs highlight a consistent issue: the system identifies *potential* time slots based on individual availabilities but fails to synthesize this information into a *definite* meeting time that satisfies everyone, considering preferences. It mostly lists free times without providing a concrete solution. This often leads to ignoring explicit constraints, especially stated preferences. Furthermore, the format of the final answer varies, sometimes providing a single slot, sometimes a list of possibilities, indicating inconsistent solution generation.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic capability for parsing individual calendars and identifying free slots. However, it struggles with the core task of scheduling: finding a *mutually agreeable* time while respecting *all* constraints, particularly preferences. The system's decision-making capabilities are severely limited by its inability to synthesize complex constraint information. The system does not seem to have a reliable verification mechanism, as seen in the failure to exclude Tuesday morning for Timothy when specified.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Individual Availability Identification:** The system can successfully identify available time slots from individual participant calendars.\n*   **Basic Time Slot Overlap Detection:** It attempts to find overlaps between individual availabilities.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Integration Failure:** The system cannot reliably integrate *all* scheduling constraints, especially preferences, into a valid solution.\n*   **Lack of Concrete Solution Generation:** It fails to produce a definite, specific meeting time and day, often listing possibilities instead.\n*   **Inconsistent Output Format:** The output format varies, indicating a lack of consistent solution generation logic.\n*   **No effective constraint satisfaction:** The system does not demonstrate a method for satisfying all constraints (including preferences).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Integration & Solution Generation**. The system needs to reliably synthesize individual availabilities and preferences into a concrete, valid meeting time.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement ReAct Pattern with Constraint Prioritization:**\n\n    *   **Prompt Modification:**  Modify the system prompt to *explicitly* use the ReAct pattern. Within the ReAct cycle:\n        *   **Reason:**  List all constraints, categorizing them as \"hard\" (mandatory) or \"soft\" (preferences). Prioritize \"hard\" constraints.\n        *   **Action:**  Propose a meeting time.\n        *   **Observation:**  Check if *all* \"hard\" constraints are met. If not, modify the proposed time to satisfy the unmet constraint. *Then*, evaluate the satisfaction of \"soft\" constraints. Iterate, balancing preference satisfaction.\n    *   **Example ReAct Cycle:**\n        *   **Reason:** Hard Constraints: Nicholas not available 9:00-9:30, Sara not available 10:00-10:30. Soft Constraints: Timothy prefers not to meet Tuesday before 11:00.\n        *   **Action:** Propose Tuesday at 10:00.\n        *   **Observation:** Hard Constraints Met? NO (Sara is not available 10:00-10:30). Soft Constraints Met? NO (Timothy preference unmet).\n        *   **Action:** Propose Tuesday at 11:00.\n        *   **Observation:** Hard Constraints Met? YES. Soft Constraints Met? YES.\n2.  **Enhanced Few-Shot Examples:**\n\n    *   **Focus on Preference Handling:**  Provide *multiple* few-shot examples in the prompt that *explicitly* demonstrate how preferences are considered and balanced in the final schedule.  Vary the examples to cover different preference types (time of day, day of week, etc.). Show *reasoning* about the trade-offs made.\n    *   **Include Negative Examples:** Include examples of *incorrect* schedules that violate preferences, with explanations of why they are suboptimal.\n    *   **Demonstrate React Steps:** Illustrate the React loop in a few examples with the thought process for satisfying different constraints.\n\n3. **Enforce Output Format Consistency:**\n\n    *   **Output Format Instructions:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to provide the *single* best meeting time in a specific format (e.g., \"Day of Week, Month Day, Year, Time - Time\"). Provide examples of this format in the prompt.\n    *   **Output Verification:** Implement a post-generation Python function that *validates* the output format. If the format is incorrect, trigger a re-generation with a specific error message.\n\n4.  **Specialized Python Function (Constraint Validation):** After the LLM proposes a solution, use a deterministic Python function to *rigorously verify* that the proposed time meets *all* hard constraints. This can catch errors in the LLM's reasoning.  If the constraints are not met, give feedback to the LLM within the ReAct loop.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the error analysis, the capabilities are currently **stable but insufficient**. While the system can perform basic tasks, it consistently fails to meet the core requirements of the scheduling task. The proposed improvements are designed to shift the trend towards **improvement**.\n"

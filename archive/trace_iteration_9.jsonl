The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30-13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3-4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954. Meanwhile, Marshall was targeted only five times during the game (15 percent of targets on the Bears), the lowest since Marshall's arrival in Chicago; the Bears fell to 0-4 in games when Marshall's target percentage is less than 20 percent.\n\nQUESTION: How many points did the Saints win by?"}

Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954. Meanwhile, Marshall was targeted only five times during the game (15 percent of targets on the Bears), the lowest since Marshall's arrival in Chicago; the Bears fell to 0-4 in games when Marshall's target percentage is less than 20 percent.\n\nQUESTION: How many points did the Saints win by?\n    Sub-question Answers:\n    According to the provided text, there is no information about the number of points the Saints scored.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Not specified in the provided text., The text is missing.

In the first quarter, the Steelers scored first when Shaun Suisham kicked a 49-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.  They increased their lead as William Gay picked off Zach Mettenberger and returned it 28 yards for a TD for a 10-0 lead.  The Titans finally got on the board when Bishop Sankey ran for a 9-yard TD for a 10-7 game.  However, the Steelers pulled away as Suisham kicked another field goal from 23 yards out for a 13-7 lead.  In the 2nd quarter, it was all Titans when Ryan Succop kicked a 20-yard field goal to come within 3, 13-10.  They eventually took the lead when Mettenberger found Nate Washington on an 80-yard TD pass and led the game 17-13 at halftime.

It has been divided into several current cities and towns, including Nashua, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack. The town was originally part of a larger town of Dunstable, Massachusetts, when Massachusetts stretched from Rhode Island up to Maine. The original tract of land was bisected by the Merrimack River, an important route for the lucrative fur and log trade. Dunstable was incorporated as a township in 1673. On July 3, 1706, during Queen Anne's War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing nine while seven of the natives were killed. When the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border was surveyed and adjusted in 1741, the northern part of the town was determined to be in New Hampshire, and was incorporated as a New Hampshire town in 1746. Both the northern New Hampshire half and the southern Massachusetts half prospered, and various villages were formed along the Merrimack, but also along Salmon Brook, the Nashua River, Pennichuck Brook, and the Souhegan River, which also ran through the tract. Over the years, other towns were formed from parts of the original area on both sides of the state line, and in 1836 the remaining part that still bore the name of \"Dunstable, New Hampshire\" was renamed \"Nashua\", after the name of the river that flowed into the Merrimack at the location then referred to as \"Indian Head\". Six years later Nashua split into \"Nashville\" and \"Nashua\", but in 1853 they rejoined and became the \"City of Nashua\".

With 1:07 remaining before halftime, the Lions countered, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Joique Bell.

However, Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib blocked the extra point attempt by former Broncos (now Lions) placekicker Matt Prater, leaving the score at 7-6. In the closing seconds of the first half, the Broncos responded, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 4th-and-1. Following a questionable fumble by Thomas on the Broncos' opening possession of the second half, Lions' quarterback Matthew Stafford threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to running back Ameer Abdullah. However, the Broncos' defense denied a two-point conversion attempt by Bell that would have tied the game.

However, Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib blocked the extra point attempt by former Broncos (now Lions) placekicker Matt Prater, leaving the score at 7-6. In the closing seconds of the first half, the Broncos responded, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 4th-and-1. Following a questionable fumble by Thomas on the Broncos' opening possession of the second half, Lions' quarterback Matthew Stafford threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to running back Ameer Abdullah. However, the Broncos' defense denied a two-point conversion attempt by Bell that would have tied the game. Each team alternated punts through the next five possessions, until Broncos' linebacker Shaquil Barrett forced a fumble off Stafford near midfield. However, the Broncos had to settle for a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus at the 7:55 mark of the fourth quarter. The Lions were attempting to grab their first lead of the game, however, on the eighth play of the drive, Stafford was intercepted by Broncos' safety David Bruton. Five plays later, the Broncos expanded their lead, with Manning throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Owen Daniels just before the two-minute warning to put the game out of reach. That was Daniels' first touchdown as a Bronco. Without any timeouts, the Lions advanced to as far as the Broncos' 15-yard line with 34 seconds remaining, but turned the football over on downs.\n\nQUESTION: How many yards was the difference between Manning's first TD pass and Stafford's first TD pass?\n    Sub-question Answers:\n    The provided text is missing.

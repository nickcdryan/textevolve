In the first quarter, it was all Packers as Aaron Rodgers found Jermichael Finley on a 10-yard pass taking a 7-0 lead followed up by Eddie Lacy running for a 1-yard touchdown for a 14-0 lead.  In the second quarter, the Browns got on the board as Billy Cundiff kicked a 46-yard field goal 14-3 game.  Though the Packers moved ahead by 2 touchdowns at halftime when Mason Crosby nailed a 26-yard field goal for a 17-3 game.  In the third quarter, the Browns would score the only points when Cundiff kicked another field goal this time from 44 yards out for a 17-6 game.  In the fourth quarter, the Packers went back to work as Rodgers found Jordy Nelson on a 1-yard pass for a 24-6 game.  The Browns came within 11 again as Brandon Weeden found Jordan Cameron on a 2-yard pass for a 24-13 game.  The Packers would later on seal the game when Rodgers found Jarrett Boykin on a 20-yard pass for the eventual final score 31-13.\n\nQUESTION: How many points were the Packers winning by at halftime?\n        Validated Claims: []\n        Final Answer:\n        ", "system_instruction": "You are an answer synthesizer who generates answers from validated claims."}, "output": "This question cannot be answered from the given source.\n", "status": "success"}

On the Broncos' first offensive possession, running back Ronnie Hillman committed a fumble deep in their own territory, and the Steelers capitalized two plays later, with a 2-yard touchdown run by running back DeAngelo Williams. The Broncos reeled off 20 unanswered points, with quarterback Brock Osweiler throwing a pair of touchdown passes - an 18-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and a 61-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, followed in the second quarter by Osweiler scrambling for a 7-yard touchdown. The latter score came after the Broncos' defense intercepted Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, and also had a missed extra-point attempt by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Steelers then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Chris Boswell. The Broncos then increased their lead to 27-10, with Osweiler connecting with Thomas on a 6-yard touchdown pass at the 2-minute warning. However, it would be the Broncos' final scoring play of the game, as the offense was shut out in the second half for the third consecutive week. The Steelers pulled to within 27-13, with Boswell kicking a 41-yard field goal just before halftime. Midway through the third quarter, Roethlisberger connected with wide receiver Antonio Brown on a 9-yard touchdown. Later in the third quarter, Broncos' return specialist Jordan Norwood returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown; however, the touchdown was nullified by an illegal substitution penalty. Following a Broncos' three-and-out, the Steelers tied the game early in the fourth quarter, with Roethlisberger throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Markus Wheaton. Each team proceeded to trade punt on their next two possessions, and with just over five minutes remaining, Osweiler was intercepted by Steelers' linebacker Ryan Shazier at the Broncos' 37-yard line, and three plays later, the Steelers re-claimed the lead, with a 23-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. The Broncos then marched down to the Steelers' 36-yard line with 2:17 remaining, but turned the football over on downs. Just before the two-minute warning, the Steelers were attempting to run out the clock, however, Roethlisberger chose to pass the football, and was intercepted by linebacker Brandon Marshall just before the two-minute warning, giving the Broncos one last possession. However, Osweiler threw four straight incompletions, and the Steelers ran out the clock.\n\nQUESTION: Who scored more points, the Steelers or the Broncos?"}

The Broncos reeled off 20 unanswered points, with quarterback Brock Osweiler throwing a pair of touchdown passes - an 18-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and a 61-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, followed in the second quarter by Osweiler scrambling for a 7-yard touchdown.

The Broncos then increased their lead to 27-10, with Osweiler connecting with Thomas on a 6-yard touchdown pass at the 2-minute warning.

On John's death in 1236 the war was taken up by his son Balian. In 1239 Philip of Montfort assumed the leadership of the opposition. Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. He also held the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, which had been negotiated away from the Saracens by Frederick. So long as the Ibelins controlled the opposition, Filangieri could count on the support of their enemies as well. The Italian cities were also divided between the two factions: Pisa supported Filangieri and Genoa the Ibelins. The Ibelins controlled Beirut, Arsuf, and Caesarea as well as the old capital of Acre. In 1231 the citizens of Acre formed a commune with their headquarters at the church of Saint Andrew's in order to unify their opposition to Filangieri. In 1232 John of Ibelin was elected its mayor.\n\nQUESTION: Who died first John of Ibelin or Isabella II?\n\n            Self-Debate result: Okay, let's break down this question.

The core task is to determine the total points scored in the second half.\n\n**My Initial Thought:** I need to carefully extract the relevant scoring information from the passage, focusing only on the second half of the game.\n\n**Potential Pitfalls:**\n\n*   Misinterpreting \"second half.\" It refers to the third and fourth quarters combined.\n*   Including points scored in the first half.\n*   Arithmetic errors in summing the scores.\n*   Missing any crucial scoring details within the passage.\n\n**Debate Time!**\n\n*   **Me:** The passage states the Cardinals led 31-0 early in the third quarter. The Buccaneers then outscored the Cardinals 33-7 \"for the remainder of the game.\" This \"remainder of the game\" is the key.\n*   **Also Me:** Hold on! \"Remainder of the game\" could be ambiguous. Does it *only* refer to the period *after* the Cardinals reached 31-0? Or the entire second half?\n*   **Me:** Good point. Let's re-examine the passage. It says the Cardinals took a 31-0 lead *after* Fitzpatrick threw an interception early in the third quarter. *Then* the Buccaneers outscored the Cardinals 33-7. That strongly suggests the 33-7 represents all scoring for both teams from that point until the end of the game.\n*   **Also Me:** But what if the Cardinals scored *again*? The final score was 38-33. So, we need to figure out if that 33-7 reconciles with that final score.\n*   **Me:** Okay, let's calculate. If the Cardinals led 31-0, and the final score was 38-33, then the Cardinals scored 7 points in the second half, and the Buccaneers scored 33. That aligns PERFECTLY with the statement: \"the Buccaneers mounted a comeback, outscoring the Cardinals 33-7 for the remainder of the game.\"\n*   **Also Me:** Precisely. So, the total points scored in the second half is indeed 33 + 7.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n\nTotal points in the second half = Buccaneers' points + Cardinals' points = 33 + 7 = 40\n\n**Answer:** 40\n"}

The Raiders received the opening kickoff and immediately scored on their first possession by means of a 48-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. Up 3-0, the Oakland defense took the field and was unable to stop the Seahawks from responding. Seattle took advantage of the multiple flags against the defense as Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson facilitated a 72-yard drive to score the game's first touchdown on a 3 yard run by Lynch. Both teams went 3-and-out on their next offensive possession before Derek Carr was picked off by Seahawks LB Bruce Irvin who returned it 35 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Carr was intercepted again, this time by Richard Sherman. Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka added a field goal to put the Seahawks up 17-3. Meanwhile, the Raiders were unable to stop turning the ball over. After Hauschka's field goal, on the ensuing kickoff, T.J. Carrie's return was fumbled at the Oakland 25 and recovered by Hauschka himself at the 31 yard line.

The Raiders received the opening kickoff and immediately scored on their first possession by means of a 48-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. Up 3-0, the Oakland defense took the field and was unable to stop the Seahawks from responding. Seattle took advantage of the multiple flags against the defense as Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson facilitated a 72-yard drive to score the game's first touchdown on a 3 yard run by Lynch. Both teams went 3-and-out on their next offensive possession before Derek Carr was picked off by Seahawks LB Bruce Irvin who returned it 35 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Carr was intercepted again, this time by Richard Sherman. Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka added a field goal to put the Seahawks up 17-3. Meanwhile, the Raiders were unable to stop turning the ball over. After Hauschka's field goal, on the ensuing kickoff, T.J. Carrie's return was fumbled at the Oakland 25 and recovered by Hauschka himself at the 31 yard line. Though the Seahawks were unable to turn it into any points on Hauschka's missed field goal, Lynch picked up his second rushing touchdown of the day later in the quarter, this time from 5 yards out, and the Seahawks led 24-3 at halftime. To start the second half, however, the Raiders scored in less than a minute by blocking Jon Ryan's punt and recovering it in the end zone for a touchdown. With 5 minutes left in the third, Carr connected with tight end Mychal Rivera on a 1-yard touchdown pass to bring Oakland to within 7. Hauschka added two more field goals early in the fourth quarter and the Seahawks had a 13-point advantage with just over 9 minutes remaining. It took the Raiders until two plays after the 2-minute warning to score. Carr hooked up with Rivera again on another 1-yard touchdown pass and left it up to an onside kick to determine the outcome. Unfortunately for Oakland, their onside kick try was recovered by Seattle's Jermaine Kearse, and the Seahawks hung on to claim the victory, 30-24. With the loss, the Raiders dropped to 0-8 on the season.\n\nQUESTION: Which players scored more than one touchdown?\n\n            Self-Debate result: Okay, let's break down this passage and identify the players with multiple touchdowns.\n\n*   **Initial Claim:** Marshawn Lynch and Mychal Rivera both scored more than one touchdown.\n\n*   **Evidence from the passage:**\n\n    *   **Marshawn Lynch:** The passage states, \"Seattle took advantage of the multiple flags against the defense as Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson facilitated a 72-yard drive to score the game's first touchdown on a 3 yard run by Lynch.\" Later, it says, \"...Lynch picked up his second rushing touchdown of the day later in the quarter, this time from 5 yards out...\" This confirms Lynch scored *two* touchdowns.\n\n    *   **Mychal Rivera:** The passage mentions, \"...Carr connected with tight end Mychal Rivera on a 1-yard touchdown pass to bring Oakland to within 7.\" and then states, \"Carr hooked up with Rivera again on another 1-yard touchdown pass...\" This confirms Rivera scored *two* touchdowns.\n\n*   **Counterarguments:**\n\n    *   Could other players have scored multiple touchdowns?

Could the passage be interpreted as Dalton *and* Green each committing three turnovers, for a total of six?\n*   **Also Me:** No, the wording \"the duo committing three turnovers\" strongly suggests they *together* committed three turnovers, not that each individually committed three. The singular \"duo\" emphasizes their combined action.\n*   **Me:** Is it possible some *other* Bengals players also committed turnovers, and the question is subtly asking for *all* Bengals players who committed turnovers?\n*   **Also Me:** While other Bengals players *could* have committed turnovers, the passage *specifically* mentions Dalton and Green as \"the duo\" committing three turnovers. The question asks *which* Bengals players, implying the passage contains the answer. It's most likely the intended answer.\n*   **Me:** Is there anything else in the passage that might contradict this interpretation?\n*   **Also Me:** No, the rest of the passage focuses on the Bills' struggles and the overall game outcome.

With the loss, Buffalo falls to 3-2 going into their bye week.\n\nQUESTION: Which Bengals players combined for three turnovers?\n\n            Self-Debate result: Okay, let's break down this question about the Bengals game and the turnovers.\n\n**My Initial Stance:** The answer is Andy Dalton and A.J. Green. The passage explicitly states \"Andy Dalton and receiver A.J. Green despite the duo committing three turnovers...\"\n\n**Self-Debate:**\n\n*   **Me:** Is there any ambiguity here? Could the passage be interpreted as Dalton *and* Green each committing three turnovers, for a total of six?\n*   **Also Me:** No, the wording \"the duo committing three turnovers\" strongly suggests they *together* committed three turnovers, not that each individually committed three. The singular \"duo\" emphasizes their combined action.\n*   **Me:** Is it possible some *other* Bengals players also committed turnovers, and the question is subtly asking for *all* Bengals players who committed turnovers?\n*   **Also Me:** While other Bengals players *could* have committed turnovers, the passage *specifically* mentions Dalton and Green as \"the duo\" committing three turnovers. The question asks *which* Bengals players, implying the passage contains the answer. It's most likely the intended answer.\n*   **Me:** Is there anything else in the passage that might contradict this interpretation?\n*   **Also Me:** No, the rest of the passage focuses on the Bills' struggles and the overall game outcome. There's no other information about individual Bengals turnovers.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most direct and logical answer, based solely on the information provided in the passage, is **Andy Dalton and A.J. Green**. The passage uses specific language (\"the duo\") to indicate they were jointly responsible for the three turnovers.\n\n\n            Example:\n            Original Question: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?\n            Self-Debate result: The expert debater has arrived to the conclusion that the final answer is 59.\n            Valid\n            ", "system_instruction": "You are a Reading Comprehension Expert with a deep understanding of passages.\n        You will analyze the passage and question and provide a well-reasoned answer."}, "output": "The self-debate is valid and well-reasoned.

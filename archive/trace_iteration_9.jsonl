Essentially, 4 must be placed after both 1 and 2.\n    *   We will analyze this later when counting valid permutations.\n\n6.  **Placement of 5:**\n    *   Since 1 must come before 5, if 1 is in position *n*, then 5 must be in position *m*, where *m* > *n*.\n    *   We will analyze this later when counting valid permutations.\n\n7.  **Placement of 6:**\n    *   Since 1, 2, and 3 must come before 6, if 1 is in position *n*, 2 is in position *p*, and 3 is in position *q*, then 6 must be in position *m*, where *m* > *n*, *m* > *p*, and *m* > *q*.  Essentially, 6 must be placed after 1, 2 and 3.\n    *   We will analyze this later when counting valid permutations.\n\n8.  **Count Valid Permutations:**\n\n    This is the trickiest part. Let's think step-by-step.  A valid permutation must have the following properties for each `i` in `2,3,4,5,6`, it has to appear after each of its divisors.\n    *Let's focus on where 1 can be placed.*\n\n    *   **If 1 is in position 1:**  Then 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 can be in any order in the remaining 5 slots. This means there are 5! = 120 possible arrangements.\n\n    *   **If 1 is in position 2:**  There are 4 slots remaining.\n        2,3,4,5,6 needs to be placed after 1.\n        Let's use some symmetry.\n        There can be at most 36 valid permutations.\n\n    The key insight here is recognizing that the positions of 2, 3, and 5 are independent of each other. The position of 4 depends on the positions of 1 and 2. The position of 6 depends on the positions of 1, 2, and 3.\n\n    Let's denote the position of the number i as P(i). We must have P(1) < P(i) if i is not equal to 1, P(1) < P(4) & P(2) < P(4). and so on.\n\n    Let's consider the total number of permutations, which is 6! = 720.\n\n    Let's focus on 2. The probability that 1 is before 2 is 1/2 (half the permutations will have 1 before 2, and the other half have 2 before 1). The same applies to 3 and 5. So the probability that 1 is before 2, 1 is before 3, and 1 is before 5 is (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/2) = 1/8.\n\n    Now, we need to factor in 4 and 6, because they depend on two numbers, and three numbers respectively.\n\n    The correct answer is 24.\n    This is a difficult combinatorics problem!

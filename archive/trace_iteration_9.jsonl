Fullback Daryl Johnston added 111 rushing yards, while also catching 30 passes for 248 and scoring three touchdowns. Pro Bowl wide receiver Michael Irvin led the team in receiving with 111 catches for 1,603 yards and 10 touchdowns.  Kevin Williams (wide receiver) was another a big receiving threat with 38 receptions for 613 yards, while also racking up 1,274 return yards on special teams. Pro Bowl tight end Jay Novacek had 62 receptions for 705 yards and five touchdowns. Dallas offensive line was led by Pro Bowl selections Larry Allen, Ray Donaldson, Nate Newton, and Mark Tuinei.

The Patriots marched 75 yards in 9 plays on their first drive of the game, with LeGarrette Blount scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. Placekicker Stephen Gostkowski's kick went out of bounds, giving Seattle the ball at their own 40. The Seahawks reached the Patriots 8-yard line, but the Patriots red zone defense held them to a 26-yard field goal by placekicker Steven Hauschka and the score was 7-3. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Seahawks drove 66 yards in 10 plays, reaching the Patriots 13, but once again the Patriots kept them out of the end zone, and Hauschka kicked a 31-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 7-6. After another Patriots three-and-out, the Seahawks 65 yards in 10 plays, this time reaching the end zone on quarterback Russell Wilson's 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Doug Baldwin, but the PAT was blocked, keeping the score 12-7. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Gronkowski seemed to fumble after being hit hard by safety Earl Thomas, but replay overturned it. Two plays later, cornerback DeShawn Shead intercepted quarterback Tom Brady at the Seattle 22 and returned it 2 yards to the Seahawks 24. The Patriots forced Seattle to punt, then marched 81 yards in 11 plays, scoring on Blount's 1-yard touchdown run with 1:05 remaining in the first half. However, 1:05 was too much time for Seattle as they raced 75 yards in under a minute, with Wilson finding Baldwin wide open in the end zone for an 18-yard touchdown, giving Seattle a 19-14 lead at halftime. After a Seahawks three-and-out, the Patriots had their way with Seattle on 10 play, 91-yard drive, scoring on Blount's 13-yard touchdown run,re-taking the lead, 21-19. Seattle countered with a long drive of their own, advancing 52 yards in 9 plays, taking a 22-21 lead on Hauschka's 41-yard field goal. The Patriots countered Seattle's field goal with one of their own, marching 63 yards in 10 plays, reaching the Seattle, but the Seahawks clamped down, and drove the Patriots back to the 12 and forced them to settle for Gostkowski's 30-yard field goal, retaking the lead 24-22. Seattle countered as well, racing 58 yards in 8 plays, reaching the New England 5, but the Patriots red zone defense once more kept them out of the end zone, and Hauschka was good from 23 yards away, his fourth, retaking the lead for Seattle, 25-24. Kickoff returner Cyrus Jones fumbled the kick return, but safety Nate Ebner recovered, but two plays later, after a 5-yard gain, safety Kam Chancellor forced wide receiver Julian Edelman to fumble, with Richard Sherman returning the ball 14-yards to the Patriots 48. Eight plays later, Wilson capped off the 48-yard drive with his touchdown pass to Baldwin, with a failed two point conversion, keeping the Patriots in the game 31-24. Facing a 3rd-and-10 at their own 46, Brady hit Edelman on a 30-yard bomb to the Seahawks 24. After a 4-yard loss by Blount, Brady hit Gronkowski on a 26-yard bomb to the Seahawks 2. Very close to the end zone, Brady gained 1-yard on the sneak attempt. But on the very next play, Blount was stuffed for no gain, bringing up 3rd-and-Goal at the 1. Brady tried to sneak again, but fumbled and recovered at the Seahawks 2. On 4th-and-Goal Gronkowski couldn't catch a pass from Brady and the Patriots turned it over on downs. The Seahawks ran out the final seconds and won the game. The Pats dropped to a record of 7-2, but still maintained first place in the AFC East. This would be the last loss of the Patriots season.

These men were organised into 21 cavalry regiments and 75 infantry battalions, with about 280 modern artillery pieces, organised into 70 batteries, in support. In addition to this, however, in a boost to the army's strength, the Afghan command could call upon the loyalty of up to 80,000 frontier tribesmen and an indeterminate number of deserters from local militia units under British command. In reality, the Afghan regular army was not ready for war. As in past years, the upper levels of the officer corps were riddled with political intrigue.

After a Patriots punt, the Seahawks drove all the way to the Patriots 9, but ended up forcing to settle for a 34-yard field goal by Steven Hauschka. The Patriots responded, racing 82 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 46-yard touchdown bomb from Brady to Welker.

Seattle drove to the Patriots 48 on their next drive, but Chandler Jones strip-sacked Wilson with Ninkovich recovering at the Seahawks 47. After starting the first half with a 17-10 lead, the Patriots would only score two field goals in the second half. The Patriots drove to the Seahawks 6, but settled for a 24-yard field goal by Gostkowski, increasing their lead to 17-10. The Seahawks turned the ball over at their own 38 with less than a minute remaining in the half, and the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 3, but an intentional grounding penalty cost the Patriots points, sending the game to the half 17-10. After a Seahawks punt, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 17, and Gostkowski increased the lead to 20-10 on a 35-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After a Seattle punt, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 43, but Brady was intercepted by Richard Sherman at the Seahawks 20. After a Seahawks three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 6, but Brady was intercepted again at the 3, this time by Earl Thomas who returned it 20 yards to the Seahawks 23. On the third play of the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson hit Zach Miller for a 7-yard gain, but fumbled with Mayo recovering at the Patriots 30. The Patriots drove to the Seattle 17, settling for a 35-yard field goal by Gostkowski, extending the Patriots lead to 23-10 midway through the fourth quarter. On the first play of the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson hit Golden Tate for a 51-yard gain, with a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on Spikes, moving the ball to the Patriots 17. Four plays later, Wilson threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Braylon Edwards with 7:21 remaining, trimming the deficit to 23-17. Later in the fourth, after forcing the Patriots to go three and out, Leon Washington got the ball to the Seahawks 43 with a 25-yard return. On the fourth play of the Seahawks drive, Wilson hit Sidney Rice for a 46-yard touchdown bomb, giving the Seahawks a 24-23 lead with 1:18 remaining.

Two plays later on 4th down, Brady completed a pass to Welker for 15 yards, but it was 2 yards short of a first down, giving the Seahawks the ball.

After a Patriots punt, the Seahawks drove all the way to the Patriots 9, but ended up forcing to settle for a 34-yard field goal by Steven Hauschka. The Patriots responded, racing 82 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 46-yard touchdown bomb from Brady to Welker. Seattle countered with a touchdown of their own, racing 85 yards in 7 plays, scoring on a 24-yard touchdown pass from rookie Russell Wilson to Doug Baldwin, taking a 10-7 lead. The Patriots countered again, going 80 yards in 15 plays, scoring on a yard touchdown pass to Hernandez, retaking the lead 14-10.  Seattle drove to the Patriots 48 on their next drive, but Chandler Jones strip-sacked Wilson with Ninkovich recovering at the Seahawks 47. After starting the first half with a 17-10 lead, the Patriots would only score two field goals in the second half. The Patriots drove to the Seahawks 6, but settled for a 24-yard field goal by Gostkowski, increasing their lead to 17-10. The Seahawks turned the ball over at their own 38 with less than a minute remaining in the half, and the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 3, but an intentional grounding penalty cost the Patriots points, sending the game to the half 17-10. After a Seahawks punt, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 17, and Gostkowski increased the lead to 20-10 on a 35-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After a Seattle punt, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 43, but Brady was intercepted by Richard Sherman at the Seahawks 20. After a Seahawks three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Seahawks 6, but Brady was intercepted again at the 3, this time by Earl Thomas who returned it 20 yards to the Seahawks 23. On the third play of the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson hit Zach Miller for a 7-yard gain, but fumbled with Mayo recovering at the Patriots 30. The Patriots drove to the Seattle 17, settling for a 35-yard field goal by Gostkowski, extending the Patriots lead to 23-10 midway through the fourth quarter. On the first play of the Seahawks' next drive, Wilson hit Golden Tate for a 51-yard gain, with a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on Spikes, moving the ball to the Patriots 17. Four plays later, Wilson threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Braylon Edwards with 7:21 remaining, trimming the deficit to 23-17. Later in the fourth, after forcing the Patriots to go three and out, Leon Washington got the ball to the Seahawks 43 with a 25-yard return. On the fourth play of the Seahawks drive, Wilson hit Sidney Rice for a 46-yard touchdown bomb, giving the Seahawks a 24-23 lead with 1:18 remaining. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Jason Jones sacked Brady for a 7-yard loss. Two plays later on 4th down, Brady completed a pass to Welker for 15 yards, but it was 2 yards short of a first down, giving the Seahawks the ball. Wilson kneed twice and the Seahawks got the surprising win. With the loss, the Patriots fell to 3-3.  The loss also left them 0-2 against the NFC West.\n\nQUESTION: Which team won the game?\n    Answer:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert at generating correct answers.

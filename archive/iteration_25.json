  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage chain-of-thought approach with verification to answer questions by decomposing the problem into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. Each stage employs an LLM with a specific role (e.g., question analyzer, passage extractor, answer generator, and answer verifier) and few-shot examples in the prompt to guide the LLM. `main()` orchestrates the workflow, calling `analyze_question()` to determine the question type and keywords, `extract_relevant_passage()` to find relevant information, `generate_answer()` to form an initial answer, and `verify_answer()` to confirm the answer's correctness. All LLM interactions are handled by the `call_llm()` function.",

In the first quarter, Dallas shot first as QB Tony Romo completed a 15-yard TD pass to TE Tony Curtis.  Afterwards, the Giants responded with QB Eli Manning completing an 8-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey. In the second quarter, the Cowboys retook the lead as rookie kicker Nick Folk got a 44-yard field goal, yet New York answered with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 1-yard TD run.  Dallas reclaimed the lead with Romo completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.  However, due to a taunting penalty on LB Kevin Burnett, the Giants were given great field position to get some points prior to halftime.

Fidel briefly visited the United States during his tenure in exile to raise support for the Cuban revolution. Since the revolution and its subsequent imposition of a communist government, and among waves of mass emigration in the hundreds of thousands, some prominent exiled figures have included Carlos Franqui who relocated to Italy; Huber Matos, who was imprisoned by Castro's government for twenty years after resigning his governmental position in 1959 before relocating to Miami; Guillermo Cabrera Infante, a prominent Cuban writer, who fled to the United Kingdom; and many more. Reinaldo Cruz was one of the five first Cuban rafters. Including \u00c1ngel Padr\u00f3n, Mario Ben\u00edtez, Marcelino Gonz\u00e1lez, Nelson L\u00f3pez Est\u00e9vez. These were the first true Cuban rafters to flee the communist country on a home-made raft consisting of 8 truck inner tubes and bamboo poles tied together. They left Cuba on July 31, 1964 to then be rescued by a fishing boat named the KAL on August 6, 1964. They were surrounded by sharks said Ken Lowry of the KAL. When Ken spotted the men floating just 25 miles  East of West Palm Beach he notified the US Coast Guard. He was directed by the USCG to board them and bring them directly to Pier 66 in Fort Lauderdale. Once on board Ken asked \"where are you going\" one of the men Reinaldo Cruz said \"Miami\".\n\nQUESTION: What happened first: rescued by a fishing boat or resigning his governmental position?",

Fidel briefly visited the United States during his tenure in exile to raise support for the Cuban revolution. Since the revolution and its subsequent imposition of a communist government, and among waves of mass emigration in the hundreds of thousands, some prominent exiled figures have included Carlos Franqui who relocated to Italy; Huber Matos, who was imprisoned by Castro's government for twenty years after resigning his governmental position in 1959 before relocating to Miami; Guillermo Cabrera Infante, a prominent Cuban writer, who fled to the United Kingdom; and many more.

In the second quarter, the Cowboys retook the lead as rookie kicker Nick Folk got a 44-yard field goal, yet New York answered with RB Reuben Droughns getting a 1-yard TD run.  Dallas reclaimed the lead with Romo completing a 20-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton.

In the fourth quarter, the Giants only got a 26-yard field goal from Tynes.  Afterwards, the Cowboys completed the season-sweep with Romo and Owens hooking up again on a 50-yard TD pass.

It is estimated that the total output of mines and factories in 1921 was 20 percent of the pre-World War I level, with many crucial items suffering an even more drastic decline. Production of cotton, for example, had fallen to 5 percent and iron to 2 percent of the pre-war level, and this coincided with droughts in 1920 and 1921 and the Russian famine of 1921. Discontent grew among the Russian populace, particularly the peasantry, who felt disadvantaged by Communist grain requisitioning . They resisted by refusing to till their land.

Trailing 31-11 with 10:20 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Broncos tried to rally, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a pair of touchdown passes&#8212;a 38-yarder to wide receiver Brandon Stokley and a 6-yarder to tight end Joel Dreessen to narrow Houston's lead to 31-25 with three minutes remaining. After forcing a Texans' punt, the Broncos got the football back with 20 seconds remaining, but the Texans' defense stood their ground. Former wide receiver Rod Smith, who played with the Broncos from 1994-2007, was inducted into the Broncos Ring of Fame during halftime. Smith is the Broncos' franchise leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns.",

In January 1595, the king declared war on Spain to show Catholics that Spain was using religion as a cover for an attack on the French state\u2014and to show Protestants that his conversion had not made him a puppet of Spain. Also, he hoped to take the war to Spain and make territorial gain. The conflict mostly consisted of military action aimed at League members, such as the Battle of Fontaine-Fran\u00e7aise, though the Spanish launched a concerted offensive in 1595, taking Doullens, Cambrai and Le Catelet and in the spring of 1596 capturing Calais by April. Following the Spanish capture of Amiens in March 1597 the French crown laid siege until its surrender in September. With that victory Henry's concerns then turned to the situation in Brittany where he promulgated the Edict of Nantes and sent Belli\u00e8vre and Brulart de Sillery to negotiate a peace with Spain. The war was drawn to an official close after the Edict of Nantes, with the Peace of Vervins in May 1598.",

While the numerical calculations within these examples are correct, the conversational style and markers are not strictly necessary and may introduce unnecessary complexity in downstream processing. The detailed explanations following \"ANSWER_START\" suggest a degree of transparency in the system's reasoning process, which can be valuable for debugging and improvement. However, the format is inconsistent and could potentially lead to parsing issues if not handled correctly.\nThe output also shows that it may be more advantageous to format the answer as a pure numeric answer, and then show reasoning if necessary.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a moderate level of capability in information extraction and numerical reasoning, particularly with percentages. However, it is limited by its ability to handle implicit information and perform higher-level reasoning. The lack of robust semantic understanding and deductive reasoning presents a significant obstacle to achieving higher accuracy. The system's verbose and inconsistent output format also highlights a need for improved output formatting and consistency. The model's tendency to generate conversational responses should be further optimized to be more straightforward and direct.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Ability to extract numerical data from text.\n*   **Basic Arithmetic with Percentages:** Correctly performs percentage-based calculations.\n*   **Explainability:** Verbose outputs give insight into the system's thought process.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **High-Level Reasoning and Inference:** Inability to deduce implicit information.\n*   **Semantic Misinterpretation:** Difficulty understanding context and implied meanings.\n*   **Output Formatting Inconsistency:** Inconsistent and verbose answer format.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Enhance Deductive Reasoning:** The ability to infer information not explicitly stated is crucial for solving more complex reasoning tasks. This single focus addresses the root cause of many errors and unlocks significant performance improvements.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting Standardization:** Modify the system to produce a standardized output format (e.g., JSON). This includes removing \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers by default. Instead, generate a numeric answer, and then show reasoning only when requested or if deemed necessary. This will make output parsing and integration much easier.\n2.  **Fine-tuning with Contrastive Examples:** Augment the fine-tuning dataset with contrastive examples where the same numerical values are present but require different operations or interpretations based on subtle semantic cues. This will help the system learn to differentiate between similar-sounding questions.\n3.  **Implement Explicit Deduction Triggers:** Implement deduction triggers based on keywords or sentence structures that indicate the need for inference. For example, phrases like \"difference between,\" \"not X,\" or conditional statements could trigger specific deduction routines.\n4.  **Reinforce Numerical Reasoning with Synthetic Data:** Generate synthetic data specifically designed to test numerical reasoning in various contexts. Include examples with distractions, irrelevant information, and multiple steps to solve. Prioritize the generation of test examples that are similar to the error samples.\n5.  **Reduce Verbosity by Default:** Reduce the verbosity of the output unless a \"debug\" flag is enabled. Focus on providing the answer directly, with reasoning available on demand. The focus should be on the accuracy of the answer, not the comprehensiveness of the explanation.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the analysis, the system capabilities are currently **stable**. While the system demonstrates some strengths, the significant weaknesses in reasoning and inference limit its overall performance. The suggested improvements should lead to an **improving** trend in the next iteration.\n",

By using validation checks at each stage, we can identify breaking points and fix them.\n\nThis approach differs significantly from previous ones by:\n1. Decomposing the problem into three core, focused sub-problems with specific prompts for each.\n2. Performing an explicit extraction of training grid inputs, outputs, and the testing grid inputs. This reduces the chance of parsing errors.\n3. Explicit validation steps at each major phase of processing.\n4. Directly transforming the test input to reduce the need for complex code.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union\n\ndef call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):\n    \"\"\"Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        from google import genai\n        from google.genai import types\n\n        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"))\n\n        if system_instruction:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n                    system_instruction=system_instruction\n                ),\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n        else:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n\n        return response.text\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}\")\n        return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n\ndef extract_grids(question: str) -> Dict:\n    \"\"\"Extracts the training and test grids from the question.\"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are an expert at extracting information from grid transformation problems.\n    Given the following question, extract all training input grids, training output grids, and the test input grid.\n\n    Example:\n    question: === TRAINING EXAMPLES === Example 1: Input Grid: [[1, 2], [3, 4]] Output Grid: [[4, 3], [2, 1]] === TEST INPUT === [[5, 6], [7, 8]] Transform the test input.\n    Extracted Grids: {{\"train_input\": [[[1, 2], [3, 4]]], \"train_output\": [[[4, 3], [2, 1]]], \"test_input\": [[[5, 6], [7, 8]]]}}\n\n\tquestion: === TRAINING EXAMPLES === Example 1: Input Grid: [[0, 0], [0, 4]] Output Grid: [[4, 4], [4, 4]] === TEST INPUT === [[0, 0], [0, 0]] Transform the test input.\n    Extracted Grids: {{\"train_input\": [[[0, 0], [0, 4]]], \"train_output\": [[[4, 4], [4, 4]]], \"test_input\": [[[0, 0], [0, 0]]]}}\n\n    question: {question}\n    Extracted Grids:\n    \"\"\"\n    extracted_grids_str = call_llm(prompt)\n    try:\n        extracted_grids = eval(extracted_grids_str) #

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to solve grid transformation problems by decomposing the task into feature identification, structural transformation, and value mapping, assigning each sub-problem to a focused LLM call. The script uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model, sending it specific prompts for each sub-problem. The main function, `main`, orchestrates the workflow by first calling `extract_grids` to parse the grid data, then `identify_features`, followed by `structural_transformation`, and finally `value_mapping`, returning the final transformed grid.",

This suggests a fundamental problem with how the system handles the text-based representation of grids.\n*   The parser seems to be very sensitive to formatting errors in the grid representation.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **fragility of the grid parsing mechanism**. The system is failing to correctly interpret the grid data due to minor syntax errors or inconsistencies in the string representation of the grids. This prevents any subsequent reasoning or transformation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Robust Parsing:** Implement a more robust parsing algorithm that can handle variations in grid formatting (e.g., extra spaces, missing commas, different line endings).\n*   **Error Reporting:** Improve error reporting to provide more specific details about parsing failures (e.g., line number, expected token, actual token).\n*   **Data Cleaning:** Add a pre-processing step to clean up the grid data before parsing (e.g., remove extra spaces, ensure consistent comma separation).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Grid Parser with Error Tolerance:** Instead of directly using `eval` or similar functions, implement a custom grid parser. This parser should:\n    *   Skip whitespace.\n    *   Handle missing commas by assuming adjacency implies a new element.\n    *   Check for mismatched brackets and provide specific error messages including the location of the error.\n2.  **Pre-process Grid Strings:** Before parsing, apply a cleaning function to the grid strings. This function should:\n    *   Remove leading/trailing whitespace from each line.\n    *   Remove extra spaces between numbers and commas.\n    *   Ensure consistent comma usage.\n3.  **Add Detailed Logging/Debugging:** Include `print` statements or logging to output the raw grid strings *before* and *after* pre-processing, as well as any intermediate parsing steps. This will make it easier to pinpoint exactly where the parsing fails.\n4.  **Validate Dimensions After Parsing:** After successfully parsing a grid, validate that the dimensions are consistent with the input and output sizes expected. This can catch errors early.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**OVERALL SYSTEM ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a very low level of functionality with its current implementation. Its accuracy is zero due to a complete failure in parsing the input grid data. While it seems to recognize the general structure of the input, it is highly sensitive to even minor syntax errors, leading to immediate failure. The system's error handling is rudimentary, providing a generic error message rather than specific debugging information. Overall, the system is currently **non-functional** in terms of its intended purpose.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently report parsing errors, revealing a fundamental flaw in the grid extraction and processing mechanism. The errors specifically point to invalid syntax and mismatched parentheses within the grid data strings.  The system seems to be relying on a brittle parsing method that is easily broken by small deviations from the expected format.  The consistent \"Could not extract all necessary grids\" error indicates that the entire process is failing at the initial parsing stage. The fact that all three samples fail in the same way highlights a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents.  There's no evidence of any successful downstream processing after the parsing failure. The error messages themselves, while informative, could be more helpful if they included specific line and character positions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\n*   **Information Extraction (Grid Data):** Non-existent. The system cannot reliably extract grid data due to parsing failures.\n*   **Grid Transformation:** Untested. This capability cannot be assessed since the grid data cannot be reliably extracted.\n*   **Error Handling:** Basic, but insufficient.  Detects errors but provides limited diagnostic information.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Recognition of Grid Structure:** The system attempts to extract grid data, indicating it recognizes the input as grid-based.\n*   **Identification of Transformation Need:** Acknowledges the need for grid transformation, suggesting understanding of the overall problem.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Brittle Grid Parsing:** The system's grid parsing is extremely fragile and fails on even minor syntax errors. This is the primary and most critical weakness.\n*   **Insufficient Error Reporting:**  The error messages are too generic and lack the necessary detail for effective debugging.\n*   **Lack of Error Tolerance:** The parser lacks the ability to handle variations or imperfections in the input data.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **robust grid parsing**.  Without this capability, the system cannot perform any further processing.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the error analysis and improvement suggestions, here's a list of prioritized actionable recommendations for the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement a Custom Grid Parser (Highest Priority):**  Replace the current parsing method (likely `eval` or similar) with a custom-built parser specifically designed for handling grid data.  This parser *must* include:\n    *   **Whitespace Handling:** Ignore leading/trailing/extra whitespace.\n    *   **Comma Handling:**  Gracefully handle missing commas or extra commas.  Consider inferring elements based on adjacency if commas are missing.\n    *   **Bracket Matching:**  Implement robust bracket matching with specific error messages for mismatches, including line and character number.\n    *   **Dimension Checking:** Validate the dimensions of the parsed grid against expected dimensions.\n2.  **Introduce Pre-processing (High Priority):** Create a pre-processing function that cleans up the grid strings *before* parsing.  This function should address:\n    *   Whitespace removal.\n    *   Comma consistency.\n    *   Convert to a standard format (e.g., all commas present, consistent line endings).\n3.  **Enhance Error Reporting (Medium Priority):**  Improve the error messages to provide more specific information.  Include:\n    *   Line number where the error occurred.\n    *   Expected token vs. actual token.\n    *   The raw grid string that caused the error.\n    *   A clear indication of whether the error occurred during parsing or validation.\n4.  **Implement Detailed Logging (Medium Priority):** Add extensive logging throughout the parsing process.  Log:\n    *   The raw grid string *before* pre-processing.\n    *   The grid string *after* pre-processing.\n    *   Intermediate parsing steps and data structures.\n    *   Any errors encountered during parsing and the context in which they occurred.\n5.  **Add Unit Tests (High Priority):** Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests that specifically target the grid parsing functionality.  Include tests for:\n    *   Valid grids with different dimensions.\n    *   Grids with missing commas.\n    *   Grids with extra commas.\n    *   Grids with mismatched brackets.\n    *   Grids with whitespace variations.\n    *   Grids with invalid characters.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Declining**.  The system's inability to parse grids renders it completely ineffective. The system must address these parsing issues to show any improvement. After implementing the recommended parsing fixes, future trends should be monitored based on the model's performance across a wider array of edge cases.\n",

This suggests a fundamental problem with how the system handles the text-based representation of grids.\n*   The parser seems to be very sensitive to formatting errors in the grid representation.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **fragility of the grid parsing mechanism**. The system is failing to correctly interpret the grid data due to minor syntax errors or inconsistencies in the string representation of the grids. This prevents any subsequent reasoning or transformation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Robust Parsing:** Implement a more robust parsing algorithm that can handle variations in grid formatting (e.g., extra spaces, missing commas, different line endings).\n*   **Error Reporting:** Improve error reporting to provide more specific details about parsing failures (e.g., line number, expected token, actual token).\n*   **Data Cleaning:** Add a pre-processing step to clean up the grid data before parsing (e.g., remove extra spaces, ensure consistent comma separation).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Grid Parser with Error Tolerance:** Instead of directly using `eval` or similar functions, implement a custom grid parser. This parser should:\n    *   Skip whitespace.\n    *   Handle missing commas by assuming adjacency implies a new element.\n    *   Check for mismatched brackets and provide specific error messages including the location of the error.\n2.  **Pre-process Grid Strings:** Before parsing, apply a cleaning function to the grid strings. This function should:\n    *   Remove leading/trailing whitespace from each line.\n    *   Remove extra spaces between numbers and commas.\n    *   Ensure consistent comma usage.\n3.  **Add Detailed Logging/Debugging:** Include `print` statements or logging to output the raw grid strings *before* and *after* pre-processing, as well as any intermediate parsing steps. This will make it easier to pinpoint exactly where the parsing fails.\n4.  **Validate Dimensions After Parsing:** After successfully parsing a grid, validate that the dimensions are consistent with the input and output sizes expected. This can catch errors early.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**OVERALL SYSTEM ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a very low level of functionality with its current implementation. Its accuracy is zero due to a complete failure in parsing the input grid data. While it seems to recognize the general structure of the input, it is highly sensitive to even minor syntax errors, leading to immediate failure. The system's error handling is rudimentary, providing a generic error message rather than specific debugging information. Overall, the system is currently **non-functional** in terms of its intended purpose.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently report parsing errors, revealing a fundamental flaw in the grid extraction and processing mechanism. The errors specifically point to invalid syntax and mismatched parentheses within the grid data strings.  The system seems to be relying on a brittle parsing method that is easily broken by small deviations from the expected format.  The consistent \"Could not extract all necessary grids\" error indicates that the entire process is failing at the initial parsing stage. The fact that all three samples fail in the same way highlights a systemic problem rather than isolated incidents.  There's no evidence of any successful downstream processing after the parsing failure. The error messages themselves, while informative, could be more helpful if they included specific line and character positions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\n*   **Information Extraction (Grid Data):** Non-existent.

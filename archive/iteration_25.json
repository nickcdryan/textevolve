  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to solve grid transformation problems through a chain-of-thought approach, first extracting a transformation rule from a given example and then applying it to a test input. It uses a `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model, employing system instructions to guide the LLM's behavior as a rule extractor and grid transformer. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates the process, using `call_llm` to extract the rule, generate the transformed grid, and verify the result, with a retry mechanism for failed attempts. The `main` function simply calls the `solve_grid_transformation` function.",

Consider using helper functions for common operations.\n3.  **Debugging Tooling:** Integrate logging and debugging tools that allow you to step through the code and inspect the grid at each step. This will help pinpoint where the transformation logic is failing.\n4.  **Code Explanation Linkage:** Ensure the explanation in the prompt is generated directly from the logic used for pattern generation. Ensure the code in the prompt is exactly what is being executed by the code in the prompt.\n5. **Review Boundary Condition Handling:** Explicitly review and test the boundary condition handling within the looping logic. Ensure that no out-of-bounds accesses occur and that patterns are applied correctly at the edges of the grid.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable but with significant room for improvement**. The system can identify transformations but struggles with execution. The provided recommendations aim to shift the trend toward improvement by focusing on the core weakness.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script employs a multi-agent system to answer questions by simulating multiple search engines and reconciling their results, ultimately validating the final answer. It uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini LLM, assigning specific roles to different agents via system instructions. The problem is decomposed into simulating search (`simulate_search`), extracting answers (`extract_answer`), reconciling answers (`reconcile_answers`), and verifying sources (`source_verifier`). The `main` function orchestrates the workflow, calling `simulate_search` to get results, `extract_answer` to extract the answers from the search results, `reconcile_answers` to get a final answer, and `source_verifier` to validate the answer.",

This also highlights an issue in determining what constitutes semantic equivalence when the gold answer is a strict number.\n2.  **Knowledge Base Limitations/Inability to Synthesize:** The system fails to infer information not explicitly present in a given source, even if it's common knowledge or easily deducible (e.g., that mayoral elections are generally decided by the public).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Semantic Equivalence Judgement:** Inability to accurately judge if an answer containing additional information is semantically equivalent to the gold answer (when the gold answer is just the number).\n2.  **Inability to synthesize information from common knowledge:** The system is too reliant on directly matching information within the provided source, lacking the capacity to apply basic reasoning or incorporate common knowledge to derive the correct answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Numerical Inaccuracy:** When the gold answer requires a specific number, the system provides either an approximation or fails to find the specific number despite having related numerical information in the provided source.\n2.  **Source Dependence & Inference Limitation:** The system exhibits a strong dependence on the given source, failing to infer information, even when easily deducible from common knowledge.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **lack of capability to verify and refine answers against common knowledge** or to perform simple logical deductions to arrive at the golden answer if it is not directly stated in the provided source. The current system focuses heavily on retrieving and presenting information directly from the source without critical evaluation or synthesis. Furthermore, there seems to be an issue defining what constitutes semantic equivalence with respect to numerical gold answers when the system response contains supporting details.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Reasoning and Inference:** Enhance the system's ability to make inferences and apply common knowledge to answer questions, going beyond direct information retrieval.\n2.  **Semantic Understanding and Answer Refinement:** Improve the system's capacity to understand the semantic meaning of the extracted information and refine it to match the expected format and level of precision of the golden answer, specifically dealing with numbers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Incorporate a Knowledge Base:** Integrate a common-sense knowledge base that the system can query to supplement information from the given sources and validate its answers.\n2.  **Implement a Reasoning Module:** Add a reasoning module that can perform simple deductions and inferences based on the extracted information and the knowledge base. This module should prioritize answering the prompt from the source material, and only when that fails, resort to using common sense reasoning.\n3.  **Enhance Semantic Analysis:** Improve the system's ability to understand the relationships between different pieces of information and assess their semantic equivalence. Use techniques such as paraphrasing detection and textual entailment to determine if the extracted information is consistent with the golden answer. Specifically, train the system to extract the numerical component and compare that specifically.\n4.  **Fine-tune Answer Formatting:** Develop a post-processing step to refine the extracted answer to match the expected format and level of precision. For example, if the golden answer is a specific number, the system should prioritize extracting that exact number from the source, even if it means discarding other information.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID: 1**\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to accurately verify if \"approximately nine years\" is semantically equivalent to \"3\".\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate the precise numerical answer \"3\".\n\n*   **Sample ID: 2**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate a valid answer (the public) by inferring from common knowledge about mayoral elections.\n    *   decision_making: Incorrectly decided that the information was not present in the source, when the answer could be inferred.\n",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Based on Performance Summary, Error Analysis Report, Sample Execution Outputs, and Capability Mapping**\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis. The system consistently attempts to extract information and cite sources. However, the outputs highlight the following issues:\n\n1.  **Numerical Inaccuracy:** \"Approximately nine years\" when the correct answer is \"3\". This is a failure to prioritize the specific numerical value even when relevant context exists in the source material. Additionally, it shows a failure to understand that \"approximately nine years\" is not the same as \"3\" in the context of the prompt and answer verification.\n2.  **Dependence on Literal Matching:** The system fails to answer when information requires even a simple deduction. In the mayoral election example, it claims the source lacks the answer despite the implicit understanding that elections are typically decided by the public. This highlights a complete lack of inference.\n3.  **Successful Information Extraction:** The system accurately identifies and presents relevant information in some cases. The example of \"43 days\" with correct source attribution demonstrates its information retrieval capability.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system is currently a competent information retriever but lacks the ability to synthesize, reason, or critically evaluate information. It struggles with semantic equivalence, especially with numerical answers, and relies heavily on direct matching, leading to errors when the correct answer requires even minimal inference. Its accuracy score of 0.33 reflects these limitations.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction and Source Attribution:** The system effectively extracts information from provided sources and consistently cites those sources. This builds trust and allows for verification. This is the system's core competency.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Reasoning and Inference:** The system cannot infer information, even from common knowledge or easily deducible facts, hindering its ability to answer questions accurately.\n*   **Numerical Precision:** Inconsistent extraction of exact numerical answers and difficulty in assessing semantic equivalence when the extracted information contains numerical approximations or additional context.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Enhance Reasoning and Inference Capabilities:** The single most important capability to focus on improving is the system's ability to reason and infer information. This will allow it to go beyond simple information retrieval and provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Two-Step Reasoning Module:**\n    *   **Step 1: Direct Source Retrieval.** First, the system should attempt to directly extract the answer from the provided source using pattern matching and keyword extraction. If this succeeds, proceed with the extracted answer.\n    *   **Step 2: Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning.** If direct retrieval fails, activate a reasoning module. This module should:\n        *   Query a common-sense knowledge base to find related facts and concepts.\n        *   Attempt to infer the answer using basic deductive reasoning and the retrieved knowledge.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError visible in the provided 'output' fields.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The system successfully extracts relevant information from the problem statement in both successful and unsuccessful cases.\n2.  **Source Attribution:** The system consistently cites the source from which it obtained the answer, improving transparency and allowing for verification.\n3.  **Numerical Answer Identification:** In the success case, the system accurately extracts and presents a numerical answer along with relevant context.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Numerical Answer Precision:** The system struggles with providing the exact numerical answer when the extracted information provides a slightly different, less precise numerical value (e.g., \"approximately nine years\" vs \"3\"). This also highlights an issue in determining what constitutes semantic equivalence when the gold answer is a strict number.\n2.  **Knowledge Base Limitations/Inability to Synthesize:** The system fails to infer information not explicitly present in a given source, even if it's common knowledge or easily deducible (e.g., that mayoral elections are generally decided by the public).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Semantic Equivalence Judgement:** Inability to accurately judge if an answer containing additional information is semantically equivalent to the gold answer (when the gold answer is just the number).\n2.  **Inability to synthesize information from common knowledge:** The system is too reliant on directly matching information within the provided source, lacking the capacity to apply basic reasoning or incorporate common knowledge to derive the correct answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Numerical Inaccuracy:** When the gold answer requires a specific number, the system provides either an approximation or fails to find the specific number despite having related numerical information in the provided source.\n2.  **Source Dependence & Inference Limitation:** The system exhibits a strong dependence on the given source, failing to infer information, even when easily deducible from common knowledge.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **lack of capability to verify and refine answers against common knowledge** or to perform simple logical deductions to arrive at the golden answer if it is not directly stated in the provided source. The current system focuses heavily on retrieving and presenting information directly from the source without critical evaluation or synthesis. Furthermore, there seems to be an issue defining what constitutes semantic equivalence with respect to numerical gold answers when the system response contains supporting details.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Reasoning and Inference:** Enhance the system's ability to make inferences and apply common knowledge to answer questions, going beyond direct information retrieval.\n2.  **Semantic Understanding and Answer Refinement:** Improve the system's capacity to understand the semantic meaning of the extracted information and refine it to match the expected format and level of precision of the golden answer, specifically dealing with numbers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Incorporate a Knowledge Base:** Integrate a common-sense knowledge base that the system can query to supplement information from the given sources and validate its answers.\n2.  **Implement a Reasoning Module:** Add a reasoning module that can perform simple deductions and inferences based on the extracted information and the knowledge base. This module should prioritize answering the prompt from the source material, and only when that fails, resort to using common sense reasoning.\n3.  **Enhance Semantic Analysis:** Improve the system's ability to understand the relationships between different pieces of information and assess their semantic equivalence. Use techniques such as paraphrasing detection and textual entailment to determine if the extracted information is consistent with the golden answer. Specifically, train the system to extract the numerical component and compare that specifically.\n4.  **Fine-tune Answer Formatting:** Develop a post-processing step to refine the extracted answer to match the expected format and level of precision. For example, if the golden answer is a specific number, the system should prioritize extracting that exact number from the source, even if it means discarding other information.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID: 1**\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to accurately verify if \"approximately nine years\" is semantically equivalent to \"3\".\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate the precise numerical answer \"3\".\n\n*   **Sample ID: 2**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed to generate a valid answer (the public) by inferring from common knowledge about mayoral elections.\n    *   decision_making: Incorrectly decided that the information was not present in the source, when the answer could be inferred.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Based on Performance Summary, Error Analysis Report, Sample Execution Outputs, and Capability Mapping**\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis. The system consistently attempts to extract information and cite sources. However, the outputs highlight the following issues:\n\n1.  **Numerical Inaccuracy:** \"Approximately nine years\" when the correct answer is \"3\". This is a failure to prioritize the specific numerical value even when relevant context exists in the source material. Additionally, it shows a failure to understand that \"approximately nine years\" is not the same as \"3\" in the context of the prompt and answer verification.\n2.  **Dependence on Literal Matching:** The system fails to answer when information requires even a simple deduction. In the mayoral election example, it claims the source lacks the answer despite the implicit understanding that elections are typically decided by the public. This highlights a complete lack of inference.\n3.  **Successful Information Extraction:** The system accurately identifies and presents relevant information in some cases. The example of \"43 days\" with correct source attribution demonstrates its information retrieval capability.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system is currently a competent information retriever but lacks the ability to synthesize, reason, or critically evaluate information. It struggles with semantic equivalence, especially with numerical answers, and relies heavily on direct matching, leading to errors when the correct answer requires even minimal inference. Its accuracy score of 0.33 reflects these limitations.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction and Source Attribution:** The system effectively extracts information from provided sources and consistently cites those sources. This builds trust and allows for verification. This is the system's core competency.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Reasoning and Inference:** The system cannot infer information, even from common knowledge or easily deducible facts, hindering its ability to answer questions accurately.\n*   **Numerical Precision:** Inconsistent extraction of exact numerical answers and difficulty in assessing semantic equivalence when the extracted information contains numerical approximations or additional context.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Enhance Reasoning and Inference Capabilities:** The single most important capability to focus on improving is the system's ability to reason and infer information. This will allow it to go beyond simple information retrieval and provide more accurate and contextually relevant answers.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Two-Step Reasoning Module:**\n    *   **Step 1: Direct Source Retrieval.** First, the system should attempt to directly extract the answer from the provided source using pattern matching and keyword extraction. If this succeeds, proceed with the extracted answer.\n    *   **Step 2: Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning.** If direct retrieval fails, activate a reasoning module. This module should:\n        *   Query a common-sense knowledge base to find related facts and concepts.\n        *   Attempt to infer the answer using basic deductive reasoning and the retrieved knowledge. Prioritize factual accuracy and numerical exactness.\n2.  **Develop a Numerical Answer Refinement Sub-module:**\n    *   Implement a sub-module focused on identifying and extracting numerical information.\n    *   Train this module to prioritize extracting the *exact* numerical value when it exists in the source. If the number is not directly in the source, the sub-module should consult the two-step reasoning module.\n    *   Implement rules for comparing the extracted numerical value with the gold answer, considering potential units and scaling factors.\n3.  **Improve Semantic Equivalence Judgement:**\n    *   Train the system to identify sentences containing the numerical information in the source. Use techniques such as paraphrasing detection and textual entailment to determine if the sentences containing the numerical information from the source is consistent with the golden answer.\n4.  **Incorporate negative examples:** Train the model specifically with negative examples, especially around numerical extraction and inference, and the nuance of when a near answer is wrong.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy of 0.33 and the identified weaknesses, the capability trend is currently **stable but stagnant**. Without implementing the recommended improvements, the system's performance will remain limited. The focus on reasoning and inference is crucial for achieving significant progress and improving the overall capability of the AI system.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first translating a natural language question into structured data using the `translate_to_structure` function, which leverages an LLM to extract key information such as participants, duration, and busy times; it calls `call_llm` to generate a structured representation of the scheduling constraints using few-shot examples. It then uses the `schedule_meeting` function, again calling `call_llm`, to use the structured data and original question to propose a meeting time, generating a response that adheres to all constraints. `call_llm` function serves as an interface for calling the Gemini API, utilizing system instructions if provided to guide the model's responses. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `translate_to_structure` and `schedule_meeting` sequentially.",

This is further exacerbated by suboptimal handling of preferences when multiple potential times exist.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Information Extraction:** Refine how participant schedules are parsed and understood.\n- **Constraint Handling:** Improve the logic for applying scheduling constraints to identify truly available time slots.\n- **Decision Making:** Develop a more robust decision-making process to weigh preferences and select the best available time.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a dedicated function for time slot calculation:** Create a separate Python function to accurately determine the available time slots for each participant based on their blocked calendars. This function should take the working hours and blocked times as input and return a list of available time ranges.  This centralizes and simplifies the logic, making it easier to debug and test. Use deterministic code instead of relying on the LLM for this.\n2. **Improve constraint application:** After calculating individual availabilities, implement a constraint-checking function that iterates through the participants and identifies the *common* available time slots. This avoids incorrectly including times when even one participant is unavailable. This must be separate deterministic Python code.\n3. **Refine preference weighting:** If there are preferences involved (e.g., \"Amy would like to avoid Monday\"), assign numerical weights to the days. In the selection process, prioritize time slots on days with lower weights (days Amy prefers).\n4. **Add verification step:**  Before proposing a time, add a final verification step where the LLM is asked to explicitly confirm that the proposed time works for *all* participants, given their schedules. The LLM should then explain why this time works and should list the availabilities of all members during the chosen time.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 5:**\n    *   information_extraction: Likely correct extraction of individual schedules, but potentially flawed representation of them.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed in combining individual schedules to identify *shared* availability.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect solution due to flawed availability calculations.\n    *   solution_verification:  Did not properly verify that the chosen time worked for everyone.\n    *   decision_making: Correctly identifies that the meeting must be between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday\n\n*   **Sample 6:**\n    *   information_extraction: Likely correct extraction of individual schedules, but potentially flawed representation of them.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed in combining individual schedules to identify *shared* availability.\n    *   solution_generation: Generates a solution that satisfies some but not all constraints/preferences\n    *   solution_verification: Did not properly verify that the chosen time worked for everyone and took the preference into account.\n    *   decision_making: Incorrectly chose Tuesday when Wednesday was preferred and available.\n",

However, there's a significant issue: the reasoning provided often doesn't match the conclusion.\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Calculation:** The system incorrectly determines and presents the final common time slot available to all the participants. This is evident in all three example outputs where the \"Reasoning\" section includes the individual availabilities of all the participants. The individual availabilities seem reasonable, but the common time slot is simply wrong.\n*   **Lack of Transparency in Calculation:** The \"Reasoning\" doesn't explicitly show *how* the common time slot is derived from individual availabilities. This makes it hard to understand where the error lies.\n*   **Ignoring Working Hours/Constraints:** There's no explicit mention of the working hours (9:00-17:00) being applied consistently. While the first output mentions the work hours, it doesn't show how these are used to derive the final answer.\n*   **\"Magic\" Result:** The final proposed time appears almost arbitrary, lacking a clear connection to the presented availabilities. The reasoning is present, but seems disconnected from the answer.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system exhibits a *partially functional* capability in scheduling meetings. It can extract schedule information, but its core logic for determining available time slots is unreliable. It struggles with constraints (preferences). The system's primary problem is its unreliable calculation of possible times.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system appears to extract individual schedule information reasonably well, as evidenced by the individual availabilities listed.\n*   **Reasoning Generation:** The LLM can generate the reasoning for a proposed meeting time.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Availability Calculation (CRITICAL):** The most significant weakness is the inaccurate calculation of common available time slots. This undermines the entire purpose of the system.\n*   **Constraint Handling (CRITICAL):** Struggles to correctly incorporate constraints like preferred days/times.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Lack of a proper mechanism to verify if all attendees can attend a meeting at the proposed time.\n*   **Non-Deterministic Behavior:** Relying on the LLM for a deterministic calculation (time slot availability) introduces unnecessary variability and errors.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\n**Availability Calculation:** This is the single most critical capability to improve. Without accurate availability calculation, the system is fundamentally broken.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement DETEMINISTIC time slot calculation (CRITICAL):** Replace the LLM-driven time slot calculation with a deterministic Python function. This function should:\n    *   Take individual schedules (start time, end time, blocked times) as input.\n    *   Represent schedules as a list of available time ranges.\n    *   Calculate the *intersection* of all available time ranges to determine common free slots.\n    *   Enforce the working hours constraint (9:00-17:00).\n    *   Provide a clear, step-by-step log of the calculation process for debugging.\n    *   Ensure that the time zone is standardized and accounted for.\n2.  **Implement a DETEMINISTIC constraint application (CRITICAL):** Create a function to apply constraints (preferences) *after* the common available time slots are calculated.\n    *   For example, if someone prefers to avoid Mondays, penalize time slots on Mondays.\n    *   Prioritize time slots based on preference weights.\n3.  **Add a LLM VERIFICATION step**: Before presenting the final answer, use the LLM to explicitly VERIFY that the proposed time works for everyone, given their schedules. Include ALL the individual availabilities and working hours constraints in the verification prompt. Ask the LLM to explain, based on the availabilities provided, why the proposed time works.\n4.  **Implement logging and debugging:** Add comprehensive logging to trace the execution flow, variable values, and intermediate results. This will significantly aid in debugging and identifying the root cause of errors. The logging should include the original input, the extracted schedules, the calculated available time slots (before and after applying constraints), and the LLM verification output.\n5.  **Refactor Code:** Divide the code into well-defined functions, each with a single responsibility. This will improve readability, maintainability, and testability. For example, have a separate function to parse the schedule, calculate the combined available times, and apply the preferences.\n6.  **Implement Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the deterministic functions (time slot calculation, constraint application). Use a range of test cases, including edge cases and scenarios with multiple participants and constraints.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is *stable but poor*. The system consistently makes the same type of errors. Implementing the recommendations should lead to a significant *improvement*. The key will be to move the time calculations away from the LLM and into deterministic python code.\n",

This is further exacerbated by suboptimal handling of preferences when multiple potential times exist.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Information Extraction:** Refine how participant schedules are parsed and understood.\n- **Constraint Handling:** Improve the logic for applying scheduling constraints to identify truly available time slots.\n- **Decision Making:** Develop a more robust decision-making process to weigh preferences and select the best available time.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a dedicated function for time slot calculation:** Create a separate Python function to accurately determine the available time slots for each participant based on their blocked calendars. This function should take the working hours and blocked times as input and return a list of available time ranges.  This centralizes and simplifies the logic, making it easier to debug and test. Use deterministic code instead of relying on the LLM for this.\n2. **Improve constraint application:** After calculating individual availabilities, implement a constraint-checking function that iterates through the participants and identifies the *common* available time slots. This avoids incorrectly including times when even one participant is unavailable. This must be separate deterministic Python code.\n3. **Refine preference weighting:** If there are preferences involved (e.g., \"Amy would like to avoid Monday\"), assign numerical weights to the days. In the selection process, prioritize time slots on days with lower weights (days Amy prefers).\n4. **Add verification step:**  Before proposing a time, add a final verification step where the LLM is asked to explicitly confirm that the proposed time works for *all* participants, given their schedules. The LLM should then explain why this time works and should list the availabilities of all members during the chosen time.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 5:**\n    *   information_extraction: Likely correct extraction of individual schedules, but potentially flawed representation of them.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed in combining individual schedules to identify *shared* availability.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect solution due to flawed availability calculations.\n    *   solution_verification:  Did not properly verify that the chosen time worked for everyone.\n    *   decision_making: Correctly identifies that the meeting must be between 9:00 and 17:00 on Monday\n\n*   **Sample 6:**\n    *   information_extraction: Likely correct extraction of individual schedules, but potentially flawed representation of them.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed in combining individual schedules to identify *shared* availability.\n    *   solution_generation: Generates a solution that satisfies some but not all constraints/preferences\n    *   solution_verification: Did not properly verify that the chosen time worked for everyone and took the preference into account.\n    *   decision_making: Incorrectly chose Tuesday when Wednesday was preferred and available.\n",

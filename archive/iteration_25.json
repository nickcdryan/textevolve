  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with verification to solve grid transformation problems, decomposing the task into analyzing visual features and applying a transformation. The `analyze_visual_features` function uses an LLM to describe the transformation, validates the description, and refines it based on feedback, acting as an expert visual analyzer. The `apply_transformation` function then uses the LLM to apply the transformation, acting as an expert grid transformer. The overall workflow involves `solve_grid_transformation` calling `analyze_visual_features` to get a transformation description, then calling `apply_transformation` to generate the transformed grid, with both functions using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model.",

      "text_report": "## Capability Report for AI System\n\n### PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:\n- Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n- Error samples: 3/3\n\n### ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:\n(As provided in the original prompt)\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n**Sample 0:** The code correctly identifies the '8' values in the grid and attempts to update neighboring '0' values to '1'. However, it doesn't update the neighbors of the newly changed '1's which would be required after those values are set. The logic is applied correctly within its limited scope, but the intended pattern (likely a more extensive spread from the original '8's) is not fully realized. There is the issue that the grid values of 1 are then treated like 8 in the subsequent transformations.\n\n**Sample 1:** The code's logic is heavily reliant on the first row of the input grid. It iterates through the first row and applies a transformation based on the values found there, specifically setting values in the entire column in the output grid based on whether their row+column index is even or odd. This approach fails to consider other rows, leading to incorrect transformations when non-zero values exist in other rows. The code is too specific to the first row.\n\n**Sample 2:** The code correctly duplicates the grid cells, expanding the grid to twice its original dimensions. Each cell in the original grid is expanded into a 2x2 block in the new grid containing the original cell's value. Given the description, and the error case identified, the logic appears correct, but is labeled an error.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a basic understanding of grid manipulation in Python. It can generate syntactically correct code that iterates through grids and performs simple conditional updates. However, its ability to understand and implement complex grid transformation patterns is severely limited. The system struggles to generalize from training examples, often relying on overly simplistic logic or making unwarranted assumptions based on specific input characteristics (e.g., relying only on the first row). While it can perform local operations (e.g., updating neighbors), it lacks the ability to reason about the global impact of these changes and capture the intended transformation pattern.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Correct Code Generation:** The system can generate syntactically correct and executable Python code for basic grid operations.\n*   **Grid Traversal:** The system can iterate through grid cells using nested loops.\n*   **Conditional Updates:** The system can perform conditional updates based on cell values and neighbor values (though often incorrectly).\n*   **Correctness in Specific Cases (Sample 2):** Demonstrates the potential for correctly understanding and implementing specific grid transformations.\n*   **Copy Grid (Sample 0):** Can successfully copy the input grid to avoid modifying the original.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** The most critical weakness is the inability to accurately abstract and generalize grid transformation rules from limited training examples.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The system lacks the ability to effectively reason about spatial relationships between grid elements and their neighbors, leading to incorrect transformations.\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** The system demonstrates a lack of awareness of the global grid state and how local changes affect the overall transformation pattern.\n*   **Over-reliance on Heuristics:** It tends to apply overly simplistic heuristics or assumptions that don't generalize well to different input grids.\n*   **Limited Error Handling:** The system doesn't seem to include self-verification or error checking within the generated code.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Generalization**. The system's inability to extract underlying transformation rules from the examples prevents it from generating correct code for unseen inputs.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Integrate CNNs into the pattern recognition module. CNNs are specifically designed to identify spatial patterns in data and could help the system learn more complex grid transformation rules. This would require representing the input and output grids as image-like data structures.\n2.  **Implement a \"Transformation Rule Extractor\":** Develop a component that explicitly attempts to extract transformation rules from the training examples. This could involve identifying common operations, dependencies between cells, and overall patterns. For example, the system could try to identify rules like \"If cell (x,y) is X, then update cell (x+1, y) to Y.\"\n3.  **Augment Training Data with More Diverse Examples:** Increase the number of training examples and ensure they represent a wider range of grid sizes, transformation patterns, and edge cases.\n4.  **Implement Self-Verification Mechanism:** Add code to the generated solution that tests its output against the original inputs of the training examples. This will help the system verify that its outputs make sense.\n5.  **Refine Prompting Strategy:** Experiment with different prompting strategies that explicitly encourage the system to \"think step-by-step\" about the transformation pattern before generating code. For example, prompt the system to first describe the transformation rule in natural language before writing the code.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **Stable**. The system consistently generates code that exhibits similar weaknesses in pattern recognition and generalization. Without targeted improvements, there is no indication that the system's capabilities will improve on their own.\n",

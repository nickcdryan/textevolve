  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions, incorporating question analysis, information extraction, answer generation, and verification. The problem is decomposed into these four distinct steps, each handled by a specialized LLM agent. The `analyze_question` function identifies the question type and keywords, `extract_relevant_passage` retrieves the necessary information, `generate_answer` produces the answer, and `verify_answer` checks its correctness, using numerical checks when needed. The `call_llm` function is used in each step to interface with the Gemini model by packaging the prompt and system instruction. The `main` function orchestrates these steps sequentially, handling potential errors along the way.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: In 1602 O'Neill destroyed his capital at Dungannon due to the approach of Mountjoy's forces, and withdrew to hide in the woods. In a symbolic gesture Mountjoy smashed the O'Neills' inauguration stone at Tullaghogue. Famine soon hit Ulster as a result of the English scorched earth strategy. O'Neill's uirithe or sub-lords  began to surrender and Rory O'Donnell, Hugh Roe's brother and successor, surrendered on terms at the end of 1602. However, with a secure base in the large and dense forests of Tir Eoghain, O'Neill held out until 30 March 1603, when he surrendered on good terms to Mountjoy, signing the Treaty of Mellifont. Elizabeth I had died on 24 March. Although the war had effectively ended with the signing of the Treaty of Mellifont, its final battles were fought during the English invasion of West Breifne in April 1603, which remained the sole holdout Irish kingdom following O'Neill's capitulation. The kingdom was ruled by Brian \u00d3g O'Rourke, one of the alliance's chief lieutenants and leader of the Irish forces during the Battle of Curlew Pass.

However, a few observations can be made:\n\n*   **Positive Justification:** The system attempts to provide justifications for its answers, which is a good sign.  This transparency can be helpful for debugging and understanding the system's reasoning. The justification quality needs to be assessed for accuracy.\n*   **Extraction of Names:** The system can accurately extract names.\n*   **Missing Outputs:** The provided examples have some missing execution outputs, so we need to be careful drawing any sweeping conclusions based solely on these examples.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nBased on the combined information, the AI system demonstrates moderate capability in question answering. It shows proficiency in numerical calculation and information extraction. However, significant weaknesses exist in question interpretation, contextual understanding, and handling negation. The system's overall effectiveness is hindered by these limitations, preventing it from consistently providing accurate answers. The system struggles with nuance and requires more robust logic to understand the intent of the question.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Numerical Calculation:**  The ability to perform basic arithmetic operations is a fundamental strength that should be maintained and expanded.\n*   **Information Extraction:**  The capacity to extract relevant information from passages is crucial for question answering.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Question Interpretation:**  The inability to accurately interpret the question's intent, especially with negation or implicit constraints, is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:**  The lack of understanding of contextual relationships between different pieces of information significantly impacts performance.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Question Interpretation.** Addressing this weakness will have the most significant positive impact on the system's overall accuracy and reliability.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nTo improve question interpretation, implement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Negation Detection and Handling:**\n    *   **Action:** Develop a specific module dedicated to identifying and processing negation in questions. This module should analyze the sentence structure to detect negative words (e.g., \"not,\" \"no,\" \"never\") and phrases (e.g., \"except for,\" \"other than\").\n    *   **Rationale:** This will directly address the observed errors in handling negative questions (Sample ID 4).\n    *   **Testing:** Create a test suite specifically designed to evaluate the system's performance on questions with different types of negation.\n\n2.  **Enhance Keyword and Constraint Extraction with Semantic Analysis:**\n    *   **Action:**  Augment the existing keyword extraction process with semantic analysis. Use techniques like part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing to identify the *type* of keywords and their relationships to entities in the passage.  For example, in the question about the \"longest touchdown *run*,\" identify \"run\" as a key constraint related to a type of play.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will help the system identify qualifying constraints to avoid extracting incorrect information (Sample ID 7).\n    *   **Testing:** Develop test cases where the correct answer depends on understanding the semantic relationship between keywords and entities.\n\n3.  **Introduce a \"Question Decomposition\" Step:**\n    *   **Action:** Before information extraction, add a step where the system breaks down the question into smaller, more manageable sub-questions or logical statements. For example, the question \"How many percent are not non-families?\" could be decomposed into:\n        *   \"What is the percentage of non-families?\"\n        *   \"Subtract that percentage from 100%.\"\n    *   **Rationale:** This will force the system to explicitly reason about the question's intent before attempting to find an answer.\n    *   **Testing:** Evaluate the system's ability to correctly decompose different types of questions, including those with negation, comparison, and calculation.\n\n4.  **Expand Training Data with Diverse Sentence Structures and Contexts:**\n    *   **Action:** Increase the diversity of the training data to include a wider range of sentence structures, question types, and contextual scenarios. Focus on examples that highlight the importance of contextual understanding and handling negation.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will improve the system's ability to generalize to new and unseen questions.\n    *   **Metrics:**  Track the system's performance on a held-out test set to monitor its ability to generalize to new data.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, the error patterns suggest that the system's capabilities are likely **stable with room for improvement** but not rapidly improving. Targeted improvements in question interpretation and contextual reasoning are necessary to drive significant progress.  Collecting more data points over time will be important to see what capabilities are improving and what capabilities are not.\n",

It shows proficiency in numerical calculation and information extraction. However, significant weaknesses exist in question interpretation, contextual understanding, and handling negation. The system's overall effectiveness is hindered by these limitations, preventing it from consistently providing accurate answers. The system struggles with nuance and requires more robust logic to understand the intent of the question.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Numerical Calculation:**  The ability to perform basic arithmetic operations is a fundamental strength that should be maintained and expanded.\n*   **Information Extraction:**  The capacity to extract relevant information from passages is crucial for question answering.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Question Interpretation:**  The inability to accurately interpret the question's intent, especially with negation or implicit constraints, is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:**  The lack of understanding of contextual relationships between different pieces of information significantly impacts performance.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Question Interpretation.** Addressing this weakness will have the most significant positive impact on the system's overall accuracy and reliability.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nTo improve question interpretation, implement the following changes in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Negation Detection and Handling:**\n    *   **Action:** Develop a specific module dedicated to identifying and processing negation in questions. This module should analyze the sentence structure to detect negative words (e.g., \"not,\" \"no,\" \"never\") and phrases (e.g., \"except for,\" \"other than\").\n    *   **Rationale:** This will directly address the observed errors in handling negative questions (Sample ID 4).\n    *   **Testing:** Create a test suite specifically designed to evaluate the system's performance on questions with different types of negation.\n\n2.  **Enhance Keyword and Constraint Extraction with Semantic Analysis:**\n    *   **Action:**  Augment the existing keyword extraction process with semantic analysis. Use techniques like part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing to identify the *type* of keywords and their relationships to entities in the passage.  For example, in the question about the \"longest touchdown *run*,\" identify \"run\" as a key constraint related to a type of play.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will help the system identify qualifying constraints to avoid extracting incorrect information (Sample ID 7).\n    *   **Testing:** Develop test cases where the correct answer depends on understanding the semantic relationship between keywords and entities.\n\n3.  **Introduce a \"Question Decomposition\" Step:**\n    *   **Action:** Before information extraction, add a step where the system breaks down the question into smaller, more manageable sub-questions or logical statements. For example, the question \"How many percent are not non-families?\" could be decomposed into:\n        *   \"What is the percentage of non-families?\"\n        *   \"Subtract that percentage from 100%.\"\n    *   **Rationale:** This will force the system to explicitly reason about the question's intent before attempting to find an answer.\n    *   **Testing:** Evaluate the system's ability to correctly decompose different types of questions, including those with negation, comparison, and calculation.\n\n4.  **Expand Training Data with Diverse Sentence Structures and Contexts:**\n    *   **Action:** Increase the diversity of the training data to include a wider range of sentence structures, question types, and contextual scenarios. Focus on examples that highlight the importance of contextual understanding and handling negation.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will improve the system's ability to generalize to new and unseen questions.\n    *   **Metrics:**  Track the system's performance on a held-out test set to monitor its ability to generalize to new data.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to definitively assess the capability trend. However, the error patterns suggest that the system's capabilities are likely **stable with room for improvement** but not rapidly improving. Targeted improvements in question interpretation and contextual reasoning are necessary to drive significant progress.  Collecting more data points over time will be important to see what capabilities are improving and what capabilities are not.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings using a multi-agent system with information extraction, scheduling, and verification agents. The `extract_meeting_info` function extracts meeting details using multi-example few shot learning and iterative verification. The `schedule_meeting` function generates a proposed meeting time based on the extracted information, also using few-shot learning, followed by result validation. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling the other agents and handling any exceptions.\n\nThe main function processes a question, and runs the extraction and scheduling functions which extract the information using `extract_meeting_info` with multi-shot learning and verification, and then schedules the meeting using `schedule_meeting`, followed by verification. The functions `call_llm` is called by `extract_meeting_info` and `schedule_meeting` functions to run the LLM to generate responses. The overall workflow involves extracting meeting details, proposing a meeting time, and verifying both steps to ensure accuracy.",

This signals an issue with the solution generation/verification process.\n2.  **Incorrect Conflict Identification:** The system often flags a time as conflicting when it is actually free based on the participant's provided schedules.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **flawed solution generation and verification logic**. The system attempts to verify a single proposed time, rather than exploring multiple possibilities or having a robust method for choosing a reasonable first guess. The process is not systematic enough, and the logic for confirming availability based on schedules often fails, leading to the rejection of valid times.

For example, the system should construct a set of possible times, and then iterate through the participants and their schedules, eliminating infeasible solutions.\n\n3.  **Constraint-Driven Search:** Use the 'can not meet' constraints proactively.  If a participant cannot meet on Wednesday or Thursday, the solution generation should not even consider those days.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluate conflict checking:** Examine the code that is used for determining if a meeting time conflicts with an existing schedule. It is possible that there is an error in how the system iterates through the existing schedules. Is the logic correct?\n\n5.  **Implement ReAct Pattern with Debugging:** When the scheduler reports a failure, use the LLM to \"reason\" about *why* it failed and then try a different time (the \"Act\" part of ReAct).

      "text_report": "## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs highlight the strengths and weaknesses identified in the error analysis report. Let's break them down:\n\n*   **Output 1 (Success):** The system successfully identified a common free slot (14:00-14:30 on Monday) and confirmed it was available for all participants. This demonstrates the core functionality working as intended, showcasing constraint identification and conflict detection capabilities when the scenario is relatively straightforward.\n\n*   **Output 2 (Failure):** This output demonstrates the \"Incorrect Conflict Detection\" weakness. The system incorrectly claims that Betty is busy from 13:30-15:00 and 16:30-17:00, contradicting the input where Betty is available. It also makes incorrect claims about Megan's schedule. This illustrates a critical flaw in the time slot availability verification logic.\n\n*   **Output 3 (Success):** The system successfully found a time (Monday, 9:00-9:30) where all participants were available, similar to output 1.\n\nThese outputs confirm that the system's performance is inconsistent. It can sometimes find valid solutions, but often makes mistakes in conflict detection, leading to unnecessary failures.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system possesses a basic capability for scheduling meetings, demonstrated by its ability to identify some common free slots. However, this capability is significantly undermined by its unreliable conflict detection logic. The system frequently fails to identify valid solutions due to incorrectly flagging time slots as unavailable. This inconsistency renders the system unreliable for practical use. The fact that it incorrectly determines when the individuals are busy is a major logic flaw.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Constraint Identification:** The system can identify and extract schedule constraints from the input text.\n*   **Reasoning Explanation (Sometimes Correct):** The system attempts to explain its reasoning, which can be useful for debugging, although the explanations are often based on incorrect assumptions.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Unreliable Conflict Detection:** The system frequently misinterprets schedule constraints, leading to false positives for conflicts. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Inability to Consistently Find Valid Solutions:** The system often fails to find valid meeting times, even when they exist according to the provided constraints.\n*   **Potential Solution Generation Flaws:** The method for proposing meeting times might not be systematic or comprehensive, leading to missed opportunities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **reliable conflict detection**. The system's usefulness hinges on its ability to accurately determine whether a proposed time slot is truly available for all participants.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Systematic Time Slot Generation and Checking:** Instead of proposing a single time, the system should generate a list of potential time slots (e.g., in 30-minute increments) and then systematically check each one against the constraints.  Start with time periods of the correct duration, and check them in order.\n\n2.  **Refactor Conflict Detection Logic:** The code responsible for checking time slot availability must be rewritten. Use clearly defined functions for checking if a time conflicts with a single person's schedule. Ensure the logic correctly iterates through existing schedules and accurately assesses overlaps. Add logging to show what the system is doing at each stage.\n\n3.  **Debug with ReAct Pattern and Detailed Logging:** Implement the ReAct pattern and add debugging logs. When a scheduling failure occurs, the LLM should \"reason\" about why it failed and output detailed information about the schedules it is checking. The LLM should print out the schedule of each person to verify there are no issues with how it is parsing/interpreting.\n\n4.  **Few-Shot Examples Highlighting Schedule Edge Cases:** Provide the LLM with few-shot examples that specifically target different schedule conflict scenarios. These examples should demonstrate the logic for correctly identifying conflicts and resolving them. The prompt should specifically request that the model avoid invalid conflicts.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is **stable but unacceptable**. The system has some basic capabilities, but the unreliable conflict detection logic prevents it from being practically useful. There needs to be significant improvement in the fundamental correctness of the scheduling process.\n",

    "capability_report_text": "## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs highlight the strengths and weaknesses identified in the error analysis report. Let's break them down:\n\n*   **Output 1 (Success):** The system successfully identified a common free slot (14:00-14:30 on Monday) and confirmed it was available for all participants. This demonstrates the core functionality working as intended, showcasing constraint identification and conflict detection capabilities when the scenario is relatively straightforward.\n\n*   **Output 2 (Failure):** This output demonstrates the \"Incorrect Conflict Detection\" weakness. The system incorrectly claims that Betty is busy from 13:30-15:00 and 16:30-17:00, contradicting the input where Betty is available. It also makes incorrect claims about Megan's schedule. This illustrates a critical flaw in the time slot availability verification logic.\n\n*   **Output 3 (Success):** The system successfully found a time (Monday, 9:00-9:30) where all participants were available, similar to output 1.\n\nThese outputs confirm that the system's performance is inconsistent. It can sometimes find valid solutions, but often makes mistakes in conflict detection, leading to unnecessary failures.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system possesses a basic capability for scheduling meetings, demonstrated by its ability to identify some common free slots. However, this capability is significantly undermined by its unreliable conflict detection logic. The system frequently fails to identify valid solutions due to incorrectly flagging time slots as unavailable. This inconsistency renders the system unreliable for practical use. The fact that it incorrectly determines when the individuals are busy is a major logic flaw.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Constraint Identification:** The system can identify and extract schedule constraints from the input text.\n*   **Reasoning Explanation (Sometimes Correct):** The system attempts to explain its reasoning, which can be useful for debugging, although the explanations are often based on incorrect assumptions.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Unreliable Conflict Detection:** The system frequently misinterprets schedule constraints, leading to false positives for conflicts. This is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Inability to Consistently Find Valid Solutions:** The system often fails to find valid meeting times, even when they exist according to the provided constraints.\n*   **Potential Solution Generation Flaws:** The method for proposing meeting times might not be systematic or comprehensive, leading to missed opportunities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **reliable conflict detection**. The system's usefulness hinges on its ability to accurately determine whether a proposed time slot is truly available for all participants.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Systematic Time Slot Generation and Checking:** Instead of proposing a single time, the system should generate a list of potential time slots (e.g., in 30-minute increments) and then systematically check each one against the constraints.  Start with time periods of the correct duration, and check them in order.\n\n2.  **Refactor Conflict Detection Logic:** The code responsible for checking time slot availability must be rewritten. Use clearly defined functions for checking if a time conflicts with a single person's schedule. Ensure the logic correctly iterates through existing schedules and accurately assesses overlaps. Add logging to show what the system is doing at each stage.\n\n3.  **Debug with ReAct Pattern and Detailed Logging:** Implement the ReAct pattern and add debugging logs. When a scheduling failure occurs, the LLM should \"reason\" about why it failed and output detailed information about the schedules it is checking. The LLM should print out the schedule of each person to verify there are no issues with how it is parsing/interpreting.\n\n4.  **Few-Shot Examples Highlighting Schedule Edge Cases:** Provide the LLM with few-shot examples that specifically target different schedule conflict scenarios. These examples should demonstrate the logic for correctly identifying conflicts and resolving them. The prompt should specifically request that the model avoid invalid conflicts.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is **stable but unacceptable**. The system has some basic capabilities, but the unreliable conflict detection logic prevents it from being practically useful. There needs to be significant improvement in the fundamental correctness of the scheduling process.\n"

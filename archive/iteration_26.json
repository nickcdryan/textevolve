  "approach_summary": "The script employs multiple LLM-based techniques, including simulating multiple search engines and answer reconciliation, to improve fact-checking. The problem is decomposed into simulating search results, extracting answers, reconciling them, and finally validating the reconciled answer. Several agent roles are defined through system instructions (search engine, answer extraction expert, reconciliation expert, validator). Other functions used include `call_llm`, which interfaces with the Gemini model. The script uses the following functions: `call_llm` is used to interact with the Gemini model, `simulate_search` simulates search engine results, `extract_answer` extracts the answer from the search results, `reconcile_answers` reconciles the answers from different search engines, and `validate_answer` validates the reconciled answer. The overall workflow involves simulating multiple searches, extracting answers from each, reconciling those answers, and validating the final reconciled answer.",

This suggests the issues are primarily related to logical reasoning and information retrieval rather than code execution.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Reconciliation Attempt:** The system attempts to reconcile conflicting information, as seen in sample_id 0. This is a good strategy for dealing with noisy or contradictory data.\n2.  **Direct Answer Provision:** The system provides direct answers in cases where it has a seemingly confident result, as seen in samples 1 and 2.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Incorrect Information Retrieval/Fact Verification:** The system retrieves and uses incorrect information, leading to wrong answers. This is evidenced by the mismatch between system answers and golden answers across all three error cases.\n2.  **Poor Source Prioritization/Reliability Assessment:** In cases with conflicting information (sample_id 0), the system fails to identify and prioritize the correct source. The system incorrectly assumes sources are of equal reliability.\n3. **Inability to Handle Time-Sensitive Information:** All the errors involve dates, implying a weakness in the system's ability to accurately process and reason about temporal information.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information Retrieval and Integration:** The system's primary bottleneck is its inability to reliably retrieve and integrate correct information, especially when dealing with dates and conflicting sources.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Source Prioritization:** The system lacks a mechanism for effectively prioritizing information sources based on reliability and relevance. This contributes to the problem of incorrect information being used.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Date Discrepancies:** All three error cases involve incorrect dates, indicating a recurring problem with handling temporal information.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Information:** The system seems to grab some relevant information but misinterprets or misapplies it, leading to the incorrect answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **inaccurate information retrieval and integration, particularly related to dates, compounded by a lack of reliable source prioritization**. The system needs a more robust mechanism for validating and prioritizing information from different sources before using it to generate answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction and Fact Verification:** Improve the system's ability to accurately extract relevant information and verify its correctness against reliable sources.\n2.  **Source Prioritization and Reliability Assessment:** Implement a mechanism for assessing the reliability and relevance of different information sources. This could involve factors such as the source's reputation, the context of the information, and the consistency of the information with other sources.\n3.  **Temporal Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to reason about dates and temporal relationships accurately.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Source Ranking System:** Develop a scoring system for information sources based on factors like domain authority, publication date, and editorial review processes.\n2.  **Integrate a Fact-Checking Module:** Incorporate a fact-checking module that can automatically verify extracted information against a database of reliable facts.\n3.  **Refine Information Retrieval Queries:** Improve the system's ability to formulate precise and targeted queries to retrieve the most relevant information from the knowledge base. Use techniques like query expansion and term weighting to improve search accuracy.\n4.  **Implement Temporal Reasoning Rules:** Add rules that specifically handle temporal information, such as date formatting, date comparisons, and historical context. For example, prioritize dates that are closer to the event in question.\n5.  **Introduce Print Statements and Intermediate Outputs:** Add print statements to show the values of variables and reasoning steps to help debug failures.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct date and relevant context.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the conflicting dates and identify the correct one.\n    *   decision_making: Failed to choose the correct date from the possibilities.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct graduation year.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the correctness of the graduation year.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct opening date of the station.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the correctness of the opening date.\n",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Overall Performance:** Poor. Accuracy is 0.00 (0/3), indicating a significant deficiency in the system's ability to provide correct answers.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis report. The system is consistently failing to provide accurate answers, specifically concerning dates. The reconciliation attempt in sample ID 0, while a positive sign, ultimately fails to identify the correct date. The outputs reveal:\n\n*   **Incorrect Date Extraction:** All the answers provided contain incorrect dates, mirroring the error analysis's finding of inaccurate information retrieval.\n*   **Overconfidence despite Errors:** Samples 1 and 2 highlight the system's overconfidence in providing a single, incorrect answer instead of acknowledging uncertainty. This indicates an issue with confidence calibration.\n*   **Ineffective Reconciliation:** While attempting reconciliation in sample ID 0, the system fails to identify the most likely date, leading to a vague and unhelpful \"no consensus\" answer. This suggests a weak reconciliation strategy.\n*   **Lack of Explainability:** The answers lack reasoning or justification for the selected information, making it difficult to understand how the system arrived at the incorrect conclusions.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits limited capabilities in its current state. While it demonstrates an attempt at information reconciliation, its core capabilities related to information extraction, fact verification, and temporal reasoning are severely deficient. The system struggles to accurately retrieve, process, and present information, particularly when dealing with dates and potentially conflicting sources.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Reconciliation Attempt:** The attempt to reconcile conflicting information is a positive sign and should be preserved. This demonstrates an awareness of potential inconsistencies.\n*   **Direct Answer Provision (Potential):** The system's ability to provide direct answers can be valuable if the answers are correct. This should be maintained as a desired outcome.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Information Retrieval:** This is the most critical weakness. The system consistently retrieves incorrect information, rendering its other capabilities useless.\n*   **Poor Temporal Reasoning:** The inability to accurately handle and reason about dates and time-related information is a pervasive issue.\n*   **Lack of Source Prioritization:** The system fails to prioritize reliable sources over less reliable ones, contributing to the inaccurate information retrieval.\n*   **Overconfidence:** The system displays overconfidence in its answers, even when they are demonstrably wrong.\n*   **Lack of Explainability:** Missing reasoning or justification hinders debugging and improvement efforts.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Inaccurate Information Retrieval and Fact Verification**, particularly when dealing with temporal information (dates). Until the system can reliably retrieve and verify information, other improvements will be less impactful.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Fact-Checking Module with Date Verification:** Integrate a fact-checking module specifically designed to verify dates and temporal relationships. This module should cross-reference dates with multiple reliable sources and flag any discrepancies.\n2.  **Refine Information Retrieval Queries with Date Constraints:** Modify the information retrieval process to include date constraints in the queries. This will help narrow down the search results and prioritize information that is relevant to the specified timeframe. For example, when searching for a graduation year, the query should explicitly request information related to graduation dates.\n3.  **Introduce Detailed Logging with Intermediate Outputs:** Add comprehensive logging to track the information retrieval process, including:\n    *   The exact queries used for information retrieval.\n    *   The sources from which information was retrieved.\n    *   The extracted dates and their corresponding sources.\n    *   The reasoning steps used to arrive at the final answer.\n4.  **Implement a Date Standardization Process:** Prior to further processing, standardize all extracted dates into a common format. This will mitigate issues arising from varying date formats across different sources.\n5. **Add Source Metadata:** Attach source metadata to each data point, so that the reliability of that source can be considered when evaluating the data.\n6. **Fine-tune Confidence Scores:** Revise the method for confidence estimation so that wrong answers are never returned with high confidence.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **declining**. The system's inability to provide accurate answers suggests a need for significant improvements before any progress can be made. The 0/3 accuracy score highlights a critical need for intervention and targeted development.\n",

This is evidenced by the mismatch between system answers and golden answers across all three error cases.\n2.  **Poor Source Prioritization/Reliability Assessment:** In cases with conflicting information (sample_id 0), the system fails to identify and prioritize the correct source. The system incorrectly assumes sources are of equal reliability.\n3. **Inability to Handle Time-Sensitive Information:** All the errors involve dates, implying a weakness in the system's ability to accurately process and reason about temporal information.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information Retrieval and Integration:** The system's primary bottleneck is its inability to reliably retrieve and integrate correct information, especially when dealing with dates and conflicting sources.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Source Prioritization:** The system lacks a mechanism for effectively prioritizing information sources based on reliability and relevance. This contributes to the problem of incorrect information being used.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Date Discrepancies:** All three error cases involve incorrect dates, indicating a recurring problem with handling temporal information.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Information:** The system seems to grab some relevant information but misinterprets or misapplies it, leading to the incorrect answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **inaccurate information retrieval and integration, particularly related to dates, compounded by a lack of reliable source prioritization**. The system needs a more robust mechanism for validating and prioritizing information from different sources before using it to generate answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction and Fact Verification:** Improve the system's ability to accurately extract relevant information and verify its correctness against reliable sources.\n2.  **Source Prioritization and Reliability Assessment:** Implement a mechanism for assessing the reliability and relevance of different information sources. This could involve factors such as the source's reputation, the context of the information, and the consistency of the information with other sources.\n3.  **Temporal Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to reason about dates and temporal relationships accurately.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Source Ranking System:** Develop a scoring system for information sources based on factors like domain authority, publication date, and editorial review processes.\n2.  **Integrate a Fact-Checking Module:** Incorporate a fact-checking module that can automatically verify extracted information against a database of reliable facts.\n3.  **Refine Information Retrieval Queries:** Improve the system's ability to formulate precise and targeted queries to retrieve the most relevant information from the knowledge base. Use techniques like query expansion and term weighting to improve search accuracy.\n4.  **Implement Temporal Reasoning Rules:** Add rules that specifically handle temporal information, such as date formatting, date comparisons, and historical context. For example, prioritize dates that are closer to the event in question.\n5.  **Introduce Print Statements and Intermediate Outputs:** Add print statements to show the values of variables and reasoning steps to help debug failures.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct date and relevant context.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the conflicting dates and identify the correct one.\n    *   decision_making: Failed to choose the correct date from the possibilities.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct graduation year.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the correctness of the graduation year.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the correct opening date of the station.\n    *   solution_verification: Failed to verify the correctness of the opening date.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Overall Performance:** Poor. Accuracy is 0.00 (0/3), indicating a significant deficiency in the system's ability to provide correct answers.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis report. The system is consistently failing to provide accurate answers, specifically concerning dates. The reconciliation attempt in sample ID 0, while a positive sign, ultimately fails to identify the correct date. The outputs reveal:\n\n*   **Incorrect Date Extraction:** All the answers provided contain incorrect dates, mirroring the error analysis's finding of inaccurate information retrieval.\n*   **Overconfidence despite Errors:** Samples 1 and 2 highlight the system's overconfidence in providing a single, incorrect answer instead of acknowledging uncertainty. This indicates an issue with confidence calibration.\n*   **Ineffective Reconciliation:** While attempting reconciliation in sample ID 0, the system fails to identify the most likely date, leading to a vague and unhelpful \"no consensus\" answer. This suggests a weak reconciliation strategy.\n*   **Lack of Explainability:** The answers lack reasoning or justification for the selected information, making it difficult to understand how the system arrived at the incorrect conclusions.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits limited capabilities in its current state. While it demonstrates an attempt at information reconciliation, its core capabilities related to information extraction, fact verification, and temporal reasoning are severely deficient. The system struggles to accurately retrieve, process, and present information, particularly when dealing with dates and potentially conflicting sources.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Reconciliation Attempt:** The attempt to reconcile conflicting information is a positive sign and should be preserved. This demonstrates an awareness of potential inconsistencies.\n*   **Direct Answer Provision (Potential):** The system's ability to provide direct answers can be valuable if the answers are correct. This should be maintained as a desired outcome.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Information Retrieval:** This is the most critical weakness. The system consistently retrieves incorrect information, rendering its other capabilities useless.\n*   **Poor Temporal Reasoning:** The inability to accurately handle and reason about dates and time-related information is a pervasive issue.\n*   **Lack of Source Prioritization:** The system fails to prioritize reliable sources over less reliable ones, contributing to the inaccurate information retrieval.\n*   **Overconfidence:** The system displays overconfidence in its answers, even when they are demonstrably wrong.\n*   **Lack of Explainability:** Missing reasoning or justification hinders debugging and improvement efforts.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Inaccurate Information Retrieval and Fact Verification**, particularly when dealing with temporal information (dates). Until the system can reliably retrieve and verify information, other improvements will be less impactful.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Fact-Checking Module with Date Verification:** Integrate a fact-checking module specifically designed to verify dates and temporal relationships. This module should cross-reference dates with multiple reliable sources and flag any discrepancies.\n2.  **Refine Information Retrieval Queries with Date Constraints:** Modify the information retrieval process to include date constraints in the queries. This will help narrow down the search results and prioritize information that is relevant to the specified timeframe. For example, when searching for a graduation year, the query should explicitly request information related to graduation dates.\n3.  **Introduce Detailed Logging with Intermediate Outputs:** Add comprehensive logging to track the information retrieval process, including:\n    *   The exact queries used for information retrieval.\n    *   The sources from which information was retrieved.\n    *   The extracted dates and their corresponding sources.\n    *   The reasoning steps used to arrive at the final answer.\n4.  **Implement a Date Standardization Process:** Prior to further processing, standardize all extracted dates into a common format. This will mitigate issues arising from varying date formats across different sources.\n5. **Add Source Metadata:** Attach source metadata to each data point, so that the reliability of that source can be considered when evaluating the data.\n6. **Fine-tune Confidence Scores:** Revise the method for confidence estimation so that wrong answers are never returned with high confidence.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **declining**. The system's inability to provide accurate answers suggests a need for significant improvements before any progress can be made. The 0/3 accuracy score highlights a critical need for intervention and targeted development.\n"

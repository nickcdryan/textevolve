Iterative Rule Construction: Building transformation rules iteratively by progressively incorporating information from multiple training examples.\n2. Multi-Example Feedback: Gathering feedback by testing the rule on ALL training examples simultaneously, enabling more comprehensive error detection.\n3. Targeted Refinement: Using the feedback to refine the rule with a specific focus on areas of disagreement or inaccuracy.\n4. Direct LLM Transformation: Apply the transformation to the test input. This will minimize reliance on external code and improve overall efficiency.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union\n\ndef call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):\n    \"\"\"Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        from google import genai\n        from google.genai import types\n\n        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"))\n\n        if system_instruction:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n                    system_instruction=system_instruction\n                ),\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n        else:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n\n        return response.text\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}\")\n        return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n\ndef extract_training_and_test_data(question: str) -> Dict:\n    \"\"\"Extracts training examples and test input from the question.\"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"You are an expert at extracting structured data.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to induce transformation rules from training examples and apply them to a test input. It decomposes the problem into extraction, rule construction, transformation application, and verification steps, each handled by the LLM with a specific prompt. The agents involved are an extraction agent, rule construction agent, transformation agent, and a verification agent.\n\nThe functions used are `extract_training_and_test_data` to get the input grids, `construct_transformation_rule` to create a rule based on the training examples, `apply_transformation` to transform the test grid, and `verify_transformation` to verify the transformation. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling these functions sequentially, and `call_llm` is used to interface with the LLM for all tasks.",

It strongly suggests that the system is failing to properly extract or parse the generated output, indicating an issue with either the output formatting or the parsing mechanism itself. The issue is likely stemming from the use of ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END tags, and failing to extract data correctly.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   The system recognizes a transformation is needed based on training examples.\n*   The system is attempting to provide a response, not simply failing silently.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Data Parsing Failure:** The consistent \"Error parsing extracted data\" indicates a fundamental problem with handling the system's generated output. This parsing error prevents proper solution evaluation.\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Application:** Even if parsing succeeded, the \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" and similar messages suggest that the core transformation logic is faulty or not appropriately generalized from the training examples. The response is incorrect in both the generated output and also incorrectly labels a case as \"No examples were provided\".\n*   **Inability to Generalize Patterns:** The system fails to correctly apply the transformations learned from the training examples to the test input. It seems to struggle with generalizing the relationships and patterns presented in the training data.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Output Parsing and Extraction:** The inability to parse the generated output is the most immediate and critical bottleneck. Until this is resolved, the system's performance cannot be properly evaluated or improved.\n*   **Transformation Logic and Generalization:** The core logic for learning and applying transformations from training examples is inadequate. The system either fails to extract the correct patterns or cannot apply them to new inputs.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Consistent Parsing Error:** The \"Error parsing extracted data\" error consistently appears across all error cases, pointing to a systematic problem.\n*   **Generic Error Messages:** The system often returns generic error messages like \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" or \"No examples were provided\", offering little specific guidance on what went wrong.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **failure to reliably parse the output generated by the system**. This is evidenced by the consistent \"Error parsing extracted data: invalid syntax\" error. This parsing failure blocks the system from correctly interpreting its own responses and prevents proper evaluation and improvement.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Robust Output Formatting:** Implement a consistent and well-defined output format (e.g., using JSON with specific keys) that minimizes the chance of parsing errors. Ensure the system strictly adheres to this format when generating output.\n*   **Accurate Data Extraction:** Improve the data extraction mechanism to correctly parse the output format. Focus on correctly identifying and extracting the relevant solution data from within the \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags.\n*   **Transformation Learning and Application:** Revise the transformation logic to better capture the underlying patterns in the training examples and generalize them to new inputs. Consider incorporating techniques like pattern recognition, rule-based systems, or more advanced machine learning methods.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement strict JSON output:** Modify the system to generate outputs strictly in JSON format, including the predicted grid under a key like `\"predicted_grid\"`.\n2.  **Debug Data Extraction:** Add extensive logging and debugging statements to the data extraction code to diagnose why it's failing to parse the system's output. Specifically, check what the system is outputting *before* the parser attempts to process it.\n3.  **Simplify the transformation logic:** For initial debugging, start with simpler transformation rules and gradually increase complexity.\n4.  **Increase training data diversity:** Ensure the training data covers a wider range of possible transformations and input variations.\n5.  **Implement intermediate output logging:** Add logging of intermediate steps during the transformation process so you can understand how the AI is arriving at its output.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Failure (incorrectly parses output, extracts \"Transformation incorrect...\" instead of the numerical array)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (generates the incorrect transformation)\n    *   solution_verification: Failure (due to incorrect parsing, cannot verify solution)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Failure (incorrectly parses output, extracts \"Transformation Rule: No examples were provided...\" instead of the numerical array)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (incorrectly identifies lack of training examples)\n    *   solution_verification: Failure (due to incorrect parsing, cannot verify solution)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Failure (incorrectly parses output, extracts \"Transformation incorrect...\" instead of the numerical array)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (generates the incorrect transformation)\n    *   solution_verification: Failure (due to incorrect parsing, cannot verify solution)\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**System Overview:** The AI system is designed to learn and apply transformations based on training examples. However, its current performance is extremely poor, with 0% accuracy. The core issues appear to revolve around data parsing, transformation logic, and generalization.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe raw execution outputs consistently show the \"Error parsing extracted data: invalid syntax\" error. This is the most glaring issue and points to a fundamental problem with how the system handles its own generated output. Instead of extracting the predicted grid (or whatever the target output is), it appears to be attempting to parse the textual error messages like \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" or \"Transformation Rule: No examples were provided...\". This indicates the parsing mechanism is mistakenly grabbing the *error message itself* instead of the intended output.\n\nThe presence of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags suggests an attempt to delineate the desired output. However, the parser is failing to correctly identify and extract the data between these tags.  The error message \"(<string>, line 1)\" also suggests the parser is treating the extracted content as Python code, further indicating a misunderstanding of the expected output format.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities. While it recognizes the need for transformation (based on the \"Strengths\" section) and attempts to provide a response, it fails on nearly all fronts:\n\n*   **Data Extraction & Parsing:** Critically deficient. Unable to reliably extract the intended output from its generated response. This is the primary blocker.\n*   **Transformation Learning & Application:** Severely flawed. The system struggles to learn meaningful transformations from the training examples and fails to apply them correctly to new inputs. It also incorrectly labels when training examples were provided or not.\n*   **Solution Generation:** Ineffective. The system consistently generates incorrect transformations.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Impossible. Due to the parsing errors, the system cannot verify the correctness of its generated solutions.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Recognizes the need for transformation:** The system *attempts* to provide a response, indicating it understands it should be transforming the input based on the training data. This is a valuable starting point.\n*   **Error messages provide SOME information**: While the messages are generic, they do indicate whether the transformation was incorrect, or if no examples were provided (even if that is wrong). This is a small amount of signal.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Data Parsing Failure:** This is the most critical weakness.

Log *exactly* what the system outputs *before* attempting to parse it. Then, log the individual steps the parser takes, as well as the intermediate extraction output.  This will help pinpoint where the parsing is failing. Specifically, confirm the data extraction mechanism is searching for, and properly identifying, the `answer_start` and `answer_end` tags, and extracting only the data within those tags. Use a try/except block to catch the parsing error and log the raw output.\n3.  **Simplify Output:** For initial debugging, simplify the output. Have the model just output the transformed grid (even if it's wrong), and nothing else. Remove all explanatory text and error messages in the generated output.\n4.  **Simplify Transformation Logic (Temporarily):** To isolate the parsing issue, temporarily hardcode a simple transformation. If parsing is still failing, you know the problem isn't related to the complexity of the transformation logic. For example, implement an addition of 1 to each number in the grid.\n5.  **Robust Error Handling:** Implement more specific and informative error messages. Instead of generic messages like \"Transformation incorrect,\" provide details about *why* the transformation failed (e.g., \"Incorrect number of rows/columns,\" \"Invalid value in the grid\").\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **DECLINING**.

Until this is resolved, the system's performance cannot be properly evaluated or improved.\n*   **Transformation Logic and Generalization:** The core logic for learning and applying transformations from training examples is inadequate. The system either fails to extract the correct patterns or cannot apply them to new inputs.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Consistent Parsing Error:** The \"Error parsing extracted data\" error consistently appears across all error cases, pointing to a systematic problem.\n*   **Generic Error Messages:** The system often returns generic error messages like \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" or \"No examples were provided\", offering little specific guidance on what went wrong.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **failure to reliably parse the output generated by the system**. This is evidenced by the consistent \"Error parsing extracted data: invalid syntax\" error. This parsing failure blocks the system from correctly interpreting its own responses and prevents proper evaluation and improvement.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Robust Output Formatting:** Implement a consistent and well-defined output format (e.g., using JSON with specific keys) that minimizes the chance of parsing errors. Ensure the system strictly adheres to this format when generating output.\n*   **Accurate Data Extraction:** Improve the data extraction mechanism to correctly parse the output format. Focus on correctly identifying and extracting the relevant solution data from within the \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags.\n*   **Transformation Learning and Application:** Revise the transformation logic to better capture the underlying patterns in the training examples and generalize them to new inputs. Consider incorporating techniques like pattern recognition, rule-based systems, or more advanced machine learning methods.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement strict JSON output:** Modify the system to generate outputs strictly in JSON format, including the predicted grid under a key like `\"predicted_grid\"`.\n2.  **Debug Data Extraction:** Add extensive logging and debugging statements to the data extraction code to diagnose why it's failing to parse the system's output. Specifically, check what the system is outputting *before* the parser attempts to process it.\n3.  **Simplify the transformation logic:** For initial debugging, start with simpler transformation rules and gradually increase complexity.\n4.  **Increase training data diversity:** Ensure the training data covers a wider range of possible transformations and input variations.\n5.  **Implement intermediate output logging:** Add logging of intermediate steps during the transformation process so you can understand how the AI is arriving at its output.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Failure (incorrectly parses output, extracts \"Transformation incorrect...\" instead of the numerical array)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (generates the incorrect transformation)\n    *   solution_verification: Failure (due to incorrect parsing, cannot verify solution)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Failure (incorrectly parses output, extracts \"Transformation Rule: No examples were provided...\" instead of the numerical array)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (incorrectly identifies lack of training examples)\n    *   solution_verification: Failure (due to incorrect parsing, cannot verify solution)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Failure (incorrectly parses output, extracts \"Transformation incorrect...\" instead of the numerical array)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (generates the incorrect transformation)\n    *   solution_verification: Failure (due to incorrect parsing, cannot verify solution)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions:\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**System Overview:** The AI system is designed to learn and apply transformations based on training examples. However, its current performance is extremely poor, with 0% accuracy. The core issues appear to revolve around data parsing, transformation logic, and generalization.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe raw execution outputs consistently show the \"Error parsing extracted data: invalid syntax\" error. This is the most glaring issue and points to a fundamental problem with how the system handles its own generated output. Instead of extracting the predicted grid (or whatever the target output is), it appears to be attempting to parse the textual error messages like \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" or \"Transformation Rule: No examples were provided...\". This indicates the parsing mechanism is mistakenly grabbing the *error message itself* instead of the intended output.\n\nThe presence of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags suggests an attempt to delineate the desired output. However, the parser is failing to correctly identify and extract the data between these tags.  The error message \"(<string>, line 1)\" also suggests the parser is treating the extracted content as Python code, further indicating a misunderstanding of the expected output format.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capabilities. While it recognizes the need for transformation (based on the \"Strengths\" section) and attempts to provide a response, it fails on nearly all fronts:\n\n*   **Data Extraction & Parsing:** Critically deficient. Unable to reliably extract the intended output from its generated response. This is the primary blocker.\n*   **Transformation Learning & Application:** Severely flawed. The system struggles to learn meaningful transformations from the training examples and fails to apply them correctly to new inputs. It also incorrectly labels when training examples were provided or not.\n*   **Solution Generation:** Ineffective. The system consistently generates incorrect transformations.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Impossible. Due to the parsing errors, the system cannot verify the correctness of its generated solutions.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Recognizes the need for transformation:** The system *attempts* to provide a response, indicating it understands it should be transforming the input based on the training data. This is a valuable starting point.\n*   **Error messages provide SOME information**: While the messages are generic, they do indicate whether the transformation was incorrect, or if no examples were provided (even if that is wrong). This is a small amount of signal.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Data Parsing Failure:** This is the most critical weakness. The consistent parsing errors prevent any meaningful progress or evaluation.\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Logic:** The system fails to learn and apply correct transformations, indicating a fundamental flaw in its core logic.\n*   **Inability to Generalize:** The system's inability to generalize from training examples to new inputs limits its applicability.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **DATA EXTRACTION & PARSING**.

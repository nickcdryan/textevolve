It decomposes the problem into identifying transformations, applying them, and verifying the result. The LLM acts as an expert in identifying and applying grid transformations. The `main` function calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API. `solve_grid_transformation` first prompts the LLM to extract a minimal transformation set, then prompts it to apply this set to the input grid, and finally validates the transformed grid.",

There isn't a means to determine if the intermediate subgrid is valid, and if it isn't, to correct it before performing subsequent steps.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Incorrect Pattern Interpretation:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to correctly interpret and generalize transformation patterns from training examples, leading to incorrect code implementation.\n2. **Missing Validation of Intermediate States:** The lack of verification for intermediate outputs (such as the extracted subgrid, or the application of an individual transformation) prevents detection of errors early in the process and compounds the problem.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Discrepancy in Target Output Type:** The golden answer presents a substantially different type of result from the system output. This strongly indicates that the system extracted *the wrong information* about the required transformation *from the prompt* by choosing an entirely different target.\n2. **Oversimplification of Transformations:** When a transformation is not a direct value replacement, the system falls short and attempts to simplify the pattern.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe single most critical problem is **incorrect extraction and interpretation of the intended transformation from the prompt and training examples.** This leads to the generation of code that performs an entirely different function than the one specified in the test case.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Enhanced Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** Improve the ability to recognize patterns and generalize transformation rules from limited training examples. Implement contextual analysis to better understand the transformation logic rather than just focusing on direct value replications.\n2. **Intermediate State Validation:** Implement mechanisms to validate intermediate outputs (like extracted subgrids or intermediate transformation steps) to detect errors early and correct them.\n3. **Refined Prompt Understanding:** Improve understanding of the intended result and ensure there is not a drift into a result that is of an entirely different type.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Introduce more diverse training examples:** The current training set might be insufficient for the system to generalize effectively. Adding examples showcasing more complex transformations could improve pattern recognition.\n2. **Implement a \"reasoning chain\" approach:** Before generating code, the system should explicitly state its understanding of the transformation pattern in natural language. This reasoning chain can then be verified against the problem statement and training examples before code generation. Add print statements and save intermediate results so you can inspect them later and reason about where failures occur.\n3. **Develop a validation component:** Implement a module that can compare intermediate and final outputs against expected properties derived from the training examples. This module can trigger debugging or re-planning if inconsistencies are detected. For grid-based transformations, the validation component could perform sanity checks such as \"Is the output grid dimensionally consistent with the identified operation?\", \"Are the data types in the output correct?\"\n4. **Enhance context understanding:** The system should evaluate the context to determine the type of transformation the user wants. It is important to understand whether you want a subgrid to be returned, block sums, etc.\n5. **Explicitly evaluate code's conformance to initial interpretation:** After code is generated, run a function that determines whether the function fulfills the initial interpretation of the prompt and training examples.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n**Sample ID 0:**\n- information_extraction: Failed (Misinterpreted the desired transformation.)\n- solution_generation: Failed (Generated code for block sums instead of the correct transformation.)\n- solution_verification: Failed (Did not detect the mismatch between the generated output and the desired transformation.)\n\n**Sample ID 2:**\n- information_extraction: Failed (Oversimplified the pattern.)\n- solution_generation: Failed (Generated code for replacing a region, rather than fulfilling a transformation pattern.)\n- solution_verification: Failed (Did not recognize the incorrect generalisation of the pattern.)\n",

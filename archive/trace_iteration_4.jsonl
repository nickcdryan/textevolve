This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game.

At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game. During this game, the Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea, TE Dallas Clark and OT Ryan Diem all to injuries in the first half, and they did not return.\n\nQUESTION: How many touchdowns did Joseph Addai score in the first half?\n        Synthesized Answer: 3\n\n\n        Example 1:\n        Original Question: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?\n        Synthesized Answer: 59\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Example 2:\n        Original Question: Who caught the final touchdown of the game?\n        Synthesized Answer: Nate Burleson\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Is the answer correct and complete?

Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game.

Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game. With their second consecutive overtime loss, the Steelers fell to 6-5.\n\nQUESTION: How many more points did the Ravens score than the Steelers?\n        Synthesized Answer: 3\n\n\n        Example 1:\n        Original Question: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?\n        Synthesized Answer: 59\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Example 2:\n        Original Question: Who caught the final touchdown of the game?\n        Synthesized Answer: Nate Burleson\n        Validation: Valid\n\n        Is the answer correct and complete?

The Steelers managed to get on the board in the 2nd quarter when Shaun Suisham nailed a 27-yard field goal to shorten the lead to 17-3, however the Bears increased their lead when Major Wright returned an interception 38 yards for a touchdown to make the score 24-3.  The Steelers came within 14 points at halftime as Ben Roetlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 33-yard touchdown pass to  shorten the score 24-10.  After the break, Gould kicked a 32-yard field goal increasing the Bears' lead to 27-10, but the Steelers answered with 13 straight points starting in the 3rd heading into the 4th quarter as Suisham nailed a 36-yard field goal for a 14-point deficit 27-13 and then a 21-yard pass to Brown from Roethlisberger again shortening the lead to 7 at 27-20.  In the 4th quarter, the Steelers came within 4 points as Suisham nailed a 44-yard field goal to make the score 27-23.  However, the Bears were able to seal the victory with Jay Cutler's 17-yard pass to Earl Bennett for a score of 34-23 and then Julius Peppers' 42-yard fumble return for a touchdown (with a failed PAT) for a final score of 40-23.

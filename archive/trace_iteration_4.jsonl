After the death of King William II of Sicily his cousin Tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in 1190 as King Tancred of Sicily, although the legal heir was William's aunt Constance, wife of the new Emperor Henry VI. Tancred had imprisoned William's widow, Queen Joan, who was Richard's sister and did not give her the money she had inherited in William's will. When Richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance; she was freed on 28 September, but without the inheritance. The presence of foreign troops also caused unrest: in October, the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave. Richard attacked Messina, capturing it on 4 October 1190. After looting and burning the city Richard established his base there, but this created tension between Richard and Philip Augustus. He remained there until Tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on 4 March 1191. The treaty was signed by Richard, Philip, and Tancred.

Between September 1762 and April 1763, Spanish forces led by don Pedro Antonio de Cevallos, Governor of Buenos Aires  undertook a campaign against the Portuguese in Uruguay and South Brazil. The Spaniards conquered the Portuguese territories of Colonia do Sacramento and Rio Grande de S\u00e3o Pedro and forced the Portuguese to surrender and retreat. Under the Treaty of Paris , Spain had to return to Portugal the colony of Sacramento, while the vast and rich territory of the so-called \"Continent of S. Peter\"  would be retaken from the Spanish army during the undeclared Hispano-Portuguese war of 1763-1777. As consequence of the war the Valdivian Fort System, a Spanish defensive complex in southern Chile, was updated and reinforced from 1764 onwards.

On the third play of the Bills resulting possession, though, Kyle Orton was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Patriots 39-yard line. The Patriots marched 61 yards in just five plays to take the lead on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Tim Wright. After both teams punted, the Bills lugged 67 yards in just under 5 minutes to tie the game 7-7 on a Kyle Orton touchdown pass to Robert Woods. After a Patriots three-and-out, Orton was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Jones recovering at the Bills 24. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, however, but Gostkowski was successful on a 42-yard field goal try. With 0:06 seconds left in the half, the Bills were attempting to run out the clock, but McCourty stripped C. J. Spiller with Zach Moore recovering at the Bills 42. Brady hit Edelman on a quick 7 yards pass and Gostkowski kicked a 53-yarder for a 13-7 lead at the half. After receiving the opening kickoff of the second half the Patriots reached the Bills 43 in just five plays before Brady launched a bomb to Brian Tyms for a 43-yard touchdown, increasing the New England lead to 20-7. The Bills struck right back with a 13 play, 80-yard drive in just under 7 minutes, culminating in Fred Jackson scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Patriots marched 56 yards on their next possession with Gostkowski adding a 40-yard field goal to increase the lead to 23-14. After a Bills punt Brady led the Patriots down the field and, with just over 6 minutes remaining, found his favorite target, Gronkowski, for a 17-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for an offensive holding penalty on Jordan Devey. This would prove to just be a delay, because Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to LaFell two plays later, capping a 12 play, 80-yard drive. The Patriots now led 30-14 and looked to be well on their way to victory. However, the Bills wouldn't go away quietly. Kyle Orton calmly engineered an 8 play, 80-yard drive, aided by a 35-yard completion on 4th-and-2, that ended in his 8-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan, with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to one possession, 30-22. Starting at the Patriots 7, Brady converted a 3rd-and-16 with a 17-yard completion to Gronkowski, and a few plays later found LaFell on a medium pass, who turned upfield and raced down the sideline for a 56-yard touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 37-22. The Bills reached their own 42 on their final drive, but a sack by Rob Ninkovich and an incomplete pass intended for Scott Chandler on 4th-and-9 officially sealed the deal.

On the third play of the Bills resulting possession, though, Kyle Orton was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Patriots 39-yard line. The Patriots marched 61 yards in just five plays to take the lead on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Tim Wright. After both teams punted, the Bills lugged 67 yards in just under 5 minutes to tie the game 7-7 on a Kyle Orton touchdown pass to Robert Woods. After a Patriots three-and-out, Orton was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Jones recovering at the Bills 24. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, however, but Gostkowski was successful on a 42-yard field goal try. With 0:06 seconds left in the half, the Bills were attempting to run out the clock, but McCourty stripped C. J. Spiller with Zach Moore recovering at the Bills 42. Brady hit Edelman on a quick 7 yards pass and Gostkowski kicked a 53-yarder for a 13-7 lead at the half. After receiving the opening kickoff of the second half the Patriots reached the Bills 43 in just five plays before Brady launched a bomb to Brian Tyms for a 43-yard touchdown, increasing the New England lead to 20-7. The Bills struck right back with a 13 play, 80-yard drive in just under 7 minutes, culminating in Fred Jackson scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Patriots marched 56 yards on their next possession with Gostkowski adding a 40-yard field goal to increase the lead to 23-14. After a Bills punt Brady led the Patriots down the field and, with just over 6 minutes remaining, found his favorite target, Gronkowski, for a 17-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for an offensive holding penalty on Jordan Devey. This would prove to just be a delay, because Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to LaFell two plays later, capping a 12 play, 80-yard drive. The Patriots now led 30-14 and looked to be well on their way to victory. However, the Bills wouldn't go away quietly. Kyle Orton calmly engineered an 8 play, 80-yard drive, aided by a 35-yard completion on 4th-and-2, that ended in his 8-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan, with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to one possession, 30-22.

Also, $a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h$ are distinct digits from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}$.\n\n2. **Find the sum of all digits:** The sum of the digits from 1 to 9 is $1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45$. Let $x$ be the digit that does not appear in any of the four numbers. Then the sum of the eight digits that do appear is $45 - x$.\n\n3. **Rewrite the equation:** We have $10(a+c+e+g) + (b+d+f+h) = 221$.  Also, $(a+c+e+g) + (b+d+f+h) = 45 - x$.  Let $A = a+c+e+g$ and $B = b+d+f+h$.  Then $10A + B = 221$ and $A + B = 45 - x$.\n\n4. **Solve for A:** From $10A + B = 221$, we can write $B = 221 - 10A$.  Substituting this into $A + B = 45 - x$, we get $A + (221 - 10A) = 45 - x$, which simplifies to $221 - 9A = 45 - x$. Rearranging this equation, we get $9A - x = 221 - 45$, so $9A - x = 176$. Therefore, $9A = 176 + x$.\n\n5. **Find possible values for A and x:** Since $A$ is the sum of four distinct digits, the smallest possible value for $A$ is $1+2+3+4 = 10$ and the largest possible value is $9+8+7+6 = 30$. Therefore, $10 \\le A \\le 30$. Also, $x$ is a digit from 1 to 9.  Since $9A = 176 + x$, we can say $9A$ must be between $176+1=177$ and $176+9=185$.  Thus, $177 \\le 9A \\le 185$.

Let's examine the board. There are multiple \"10\" squares surrounding the \"Start\". Thus, moving to a \"10\", then another \"10\", and another \"10\" might be possible. Specifically, note a move from the center takes us to a 10. Another move perpendicular to the first gets back to the start. Thus, only two \"10\"s is possible. Hence 10+10+10 is not possible.\n    *   **Path 2: 5 + 5 + 20:** This suggests moves that end with 5, 5 and 20.\n        We need to consider different orderings i.e., 5+20+5 or 20+5+5.\n\n        *  **5+5+20:** One possible path is moving to \"5\", then to \"5\" again (which may or may not be possible) and finally to \"20\". From Start, we cannot directly go to 5 and from a 5 we cannot go back to 5. The paths are like these: Start -> 5 -> 10/15/20. Similarly, from Start we cannot directly go to 20. So the move cannot be in this form.\n        * **20 + 5 + 5:** Again, from Start we cannot directly go to 20.\n\n    *   **Path 3: 5 + 10 + 15:**\n        Consider sequences like 5+10+15 or 5+15+10 or 10+5+15 or 10+15+5 or 15+5+10 or 15+10+5.

After reaching the \"5\", she could reach other values. But she must reach \"10\" and then \"15\" at the last step. Consider a path like this - Start -> 5 -> 10 -> 15.  For example, Kendra can move \"Right\" to land on the 5. Then move \"Up\" to land on the 10.  Moving \"Left\" lands on \"15\".  The directions are Right, Up, Left.\n\n        *   **5 + 15 + 10:**  Start -> 5 -> 15 -> 10.  Right -> Up/Down/Left/Right. Moving from \"5\" to \"15\" may or may not be possible.  Consider a path like this. Right, Up/Down/Left/Right.\n\n        *   **10 + 5 + 15:** Start -> 10 -> 5 -> 15.  For example, Kendra can move \"Up\" to land on the 10.

Here's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Probability:** The problem explicitly asks for a probability, and the provided formula is the fundamental definition of probability.\n*   **Combinations/Permutations:** Because the order of the spins matters, we need to consider different sequences of moves.\n*   **Addition:** The problem requires summing the values of the board spaces, and this concept will be critical.\n*   **Game Board Analysis:** The information about the starting point, possible values, and movement directions on the board is essential for mapping out possible paths.\n*   **Possible outcomes for each turn:** We need to calculate the total number of outcomes to determine the denominator for our probability.\n*   **Possible Paths:** Listing out the paths allows us to determine the numerator for our probability.\n\nIn summary, the retrieved knowledge provides all the necessary tools and information to break down the problem, analyze the possible outcomes, identify favorable outcomes, and calculate the desired probability.\n\nSolution: 1.  **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:** Since there are 4 possible directions for each of the 3 turns, the total number of possible outcomes is 4 * 4 * 4 = 64.\n\n2.  **Identify favorable outcomes (sequences that sum to 30):** We need to find all sequences of three moves that result in a sum of 30. The possible values Kendra can land on are 5, 10, 15, and 20. Let's consider the combinations that add up to 30.\n\n    *   **30 = 10 + 10 + 10:**  We need to see if it's possible to land on 10, then 10, then 10.\n    *   **30 = 5 + 5 + 20:**  Consider sequences like 5, 5, 20 and its permutations.\n    *   **30 = 5 + 10 + 15:**  Consider sequences like 5, 10, 15 and its permutations.\n    *   **30 = 20 + 10 + 0:** Not possible as we need 3 moves\n    *   **30 = 20 + 5 + 5:**  Same as previous.\n    *   **30 = 15 + 10 + 5:** Same as previous.\n\n3.  **Analyze the board and possible moves:**\n\n    *   **Path 1: 10 + 10 + 10:**  This means landing on a \"10\" square each turn.  Let's examine the board. There are multiple \"10\" squares surrounding the \"Start\". Thus, moving to a \"10\", then another \"10\", and another \"10\" might be possible. Specifically, note a move from the center takes us to a 10. Another move perpendicular to the first gets back to the start. Thus, only two \"10\"s is possible. Hence 10+10+10 is not possible.\n    *   **Path 2: 5 + 5 + 20:** This suggests moves that end with 5, 5 and 20.\n        We need to consider different orderings i.e., 5+20+5 or 20+5+5.\n\n        *  **5+5+20:** One possible path is moving to \"5\", then to \"5\" again (which may or may not be possible) and finally to \"20\". From Start, we cannot directly go to 5 and from a 5 we cannot go back to 5. The paths are like these: Start -> 5 -> 10/15/20. Similarly, from Start we cannot directly go to 20. So the move cannot be in this form.\n        * **20 + 5 + 5:** Again, from Start we cannot directly go to 20.\n\n    *   **Path 3: 5 + 10 + 15:**\n        Consider sequences like 5+10+15 or 5+15+10 or 10+5+15 or 10+15+5 or 15+5+10 or 15+10+5. Start -> 5/10 and it will only be possible if Kendra's location matches any.\n\n        *   **5 + 10 + 15:** From the \"Start\", Kendra can move to a \"5\" or a \"10\". After reaching the \"5\", she could reach other values. But she must reach \"10\" and then \"15\" at the last step. Consider a path like this - Start -> 5 -> 10 -> 15.  For example, Kendra can move \"Right\" to land on the 5. Then move \"Up\" to land on the 10.  Moving \"Left\" lands on \"15\".  The directions are Right, Up, Left.\n\n        *   **5 + 15 + 10:**  Start -> 5 -> 15 -> 10.  Right -> Up/Down/Left/Right. Moving from \"5\" to \"15\" may or may not be possible.  Consider a path like this. Right, Up/Down/Left/Right.\n\n        *   **10 + 5 + 15:** Start -> 10 -> 5 -> 15.  For example, Kendra can move \"Up\" to land on the 10. Moving \"Right\", it lands on a 5. Then, to get to \"15\", Left again. Thus, the directions are Up, Right, Left.\n\n        *   **10 + 15 + 5:** Start -> 10 -> 15 -> 5.  \"Up\" to land on the \"10\". From 10, moving to 15 may not be possible.\n        *   **15 + 5 + 10:** Start -> 15 is not possible\n        *   **15 + 10 + 5:** Start -> 15 is not possible\n\n4.  **Count the favorable outcomes:**\n    *   Path 1: 5+10+15: Directions Right, Up, Left\n    *   Path 2: 10+5+15: Directions Up, Right, Left\n\nRight, Up, Left - Only one possibility.\nUp, Right, Left - Only one possibility.\n\n    Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes.\n\n5.  **Calculate the probability:**\n    Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes) = 2 / 64 = 1 / 32\n\nAnswer: The probability is 1/32.\n"}

The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n3.  **Properties of GCD related to problem:**\n    *   gcd(2m, 3n) = gcd(2(24n + 51), 3n) = gcd(48n + 102, 3n)\n    *   gcd(48n + 102, 3n) = gcd(3n, 48n + 102 mod 3n) = gcd(3n, 102)\n\n4.  **Divisibility Property:** If *d* divides *a* and *d* divides *b*, then *d* divides (ax + by) for any integers x and y.\n\n**Applying to the problem:**\n\nWe want to maximize gcd(2m, 3n) given m = 24n + 51. Using the properties of GCD, we can simplify the expression:\n\ngcd(2m, 3n) = gcd(2(24n + 51), 3n) = gcd(48n + 102, 3n)\n\nUsing the Euclidean Algorithm property: gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b):\n\ngcd(48n + 102, 3n) = gcd(3n, (48n + 102) mod 3n)\n\nSince 48n is divisible by 3n, (48n + 102) mod 3n is simply 102.\n\nTherefore, gcd(2m, 3n) = gcd(3n, 102).\n\nTo maximize gcd(3n, 102), we need to find the largest divisor of 102 that can be written in the form 3n. This is equivalent to finding the largest divisor *d* of 102 such that *d* is a multiple of 3.  We can find the divisors of 102 and check which ones are multiples of 3. The prime factorization of 102 is 2 * 3 * 17.  The divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 17, 34, 51, 102.  The divisors that are multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 51, 102. The largest of these is 102.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of gcd(2m, 3n) is 102.\n\nTo achieve this, we need 3n = 102, so n = 34.

Then\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{b}{a} + i \\left( 1 - \\frac{a}{b} \\right) = 1 + (1+i) + i \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{1+i} \\right) = 2+i + i \\left( 1 - \\frac{1-i}{(1+i)(1-i)} \\right) = 2+i + i \\left( 1 - \\frac{1-i}{2} \\right) = 2+i + i \\left( \\frac{1+i}{2} \\right) = 2+i + \\frac{i-1}{2} = 2+i + \\frac{i}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} i. \\]\n\n6. **Alternative approach:** From $i(b-a) = c-b$, we have $c = b + i(b-a)$.  Then\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{ac + b^2}{ab} &= \\frac{a(b + i(b-a)) + b^2}{ab} \\\\ &= \\frac{ab + iab - ia^2 + b^2}{ab} \\\\ &= \\frac{ab + b^2 + i(ab - a^2)}{ab} = \\frac{b(a+b) + ia(b-a)}{ab} \\end{align*}Since $b = a(1+i)$ (because rotating $a$ counter-clockwise by $45^\\circ$ and scaling by $\\sqrt{2}$ yields $b$), we have\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{a(a(1+i)) + a^2(1+i)^2}{a^2(1+i)} &= \\frac{a^2(1+i) + a^2(1+2i-1)}{a^2(1+i)} \\\\ &= \\frac{1+i+2i}{1+i} = \\frac{1+3i}{1+i} = \\frac{(1+3i)(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)} = \\frac{1 - i + 3i + 3}{2} = \\frac{4+2i}{2} = 2+i. \\end{align*}\n\nAnswer: 2+i\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2+i}$\n"}

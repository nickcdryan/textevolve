In the 2nd quarter, the Texans increased their lead as Randy Bullock nailed 2 field goals from 39 and 38 yards out for 10-0 and 13-0 leads.  The Steelers finally got on the board and scored 24 unanswered points:  first starting with Shaun Suisham who nailed a 44-yard field goal for a 13-3 game followed up by Ben Roethlisberger finding Martavis Bryant on a 35-yard TD pass for a 13-10 game and eventually took the lead on Antonio Brown's 1-yard TD pass to Lance Moore 17-13 and lastly Roethlisberger hooking up with Le'Veon Bell on a 2-yard TD pass for a 24-13 halftime lead.  After a scoreless 3rd quarter, the Texans came within 8 as Bullock kicked a 31-yard field goal for a 24-16 game not long before the Steelers responded with 2 of their own from Suisham when he got them from 30 and 40 yards out for leads of 27-16 and 30-16.  Finally, Fitzpatrick was able to find Arian Foster on a 1-yard TD pass and this led to the final score of 30-23.\n\nQUESTION: How many yards longer was Ryan Fitzpatrick's longest touchdown pass than his shortest?\n        Synthesized Answer: 10\n\n        \n        Is the answer correct and complete?

At 14:15, Mitscher ordered DuBose to pursue the remnants of the Japanese Northern Force. His cruisers finished off the light carrier Chiyoda at around 17:00, and at 20:59 his ships sank the destroyer Hatsuzuki after a very stubborn fight. When Admiral Ozawa learned of the deployment of DuBose's relatively weak task group, he ordered battleships Ise and Hy\u016bga to turn southwards and attack it, but they failed to locate DuBose's group, which they heavily outgunned. Halsey's withdrawal of all six of Lee's battleships in his attempt to assist Seventh Fleet had now rendered TF\u00a038 vulnerable to a surface counterattack by the decoy Northern Force.

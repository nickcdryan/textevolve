Its main objective is to find and preserve documentation about the inhabitants' lives and times so as to elucidate the political, social, and religious patterns in the Dutch colony. The society sponsors historical publications, and provides resources for family studies and genealogy. Many of its members are especially active in genealogical research and publication. The Holland Society originated the New Netherland Project, which is translating and publishing the 17th-century records held by the New York State Archives. Among other current sponsorships are The Papers of Jacob Leisler Project and Records of the Translations of the Reformed Protestant Dutch Church of Flatbush, Kings County, New York. \n\n=== Document 2: Joris Jansen Rapelje ===\nJoris Jansen Rapelje (28 April 1604 \u2013 21 February 1662/63) was a member of the Council of Twelve Men in the Dutch West India Company colony of New Netherland. He and his wife Catalina (Catalyntje) Trico (1605\u20131689) were among the earliest settlers in New Netherland. \n\n=== Document 3: Kieft's War ===\nKieft's War, also known as the Wappinger War, was a conflict (1643\u20131645) between settlers of the nascent colony of New Netherland and the native Lenape population in what would later become the New York metropolitan area of the United States. It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists. Dutch soldiers attacked Lenape camps and massacred the native inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch, and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides. This was one of the earliest conflicts between Native Americans and European settlers. Displeased with Kieft, the Dutch West India Company recalled him and he died while returning to the Netherlands. Peter Stuyvesant succeeded him in New Netherland. Because of the continuing threat by the Algonquians, numerous Dutch settlers returned to the Netherlands, and growth of the colony slowed. \n\n=== Document 4: English Neighborhood ===\nThe English Neighborhood was the colonial-era name for the towns in eastern Bergen County, New Jersey, along the Hudson Palisades between the North River (Hudson River) and the Hackensack River, particularly around its main tributary, Overpeck Creek. The region had been part of the Dutch New Netherland colony of Bergen, whose main town was located at Bergen Square in today's Jersey City. The name speaks to the geography of the region, \"bergen\" being the Dutch word for \"hills.\" Earlier attempts at settlement at Achter Col (\"behind the ridge\") and Vriessendael had been compromised in conflicts with the precolonial population, phratries of the Lenape known by their exonyms, the Hackensack and the Tappan. \n\n=== Document 5: Pound Ridge massacre ===\nThe Pound Ridge massacre was a battle of Kieft's War that took place in March 1644 between the forces of New Netherland and members of the Wappinger Confederacy at a Wappinger Confederacy village in the present-day town of Pound Ridge, New York. A mixed force of 130 Dutch and English soldiers led by Captain John Underhill launched a night attack on the village and destroyed it with fire. 500 to 700 members of the Wappinger Confederacy were killed while the New Netherland force lost one man killed and fifteen wounded. More casualties were suffered in this attack than in any other single incident in the war. Shortly after the battle several local Wappinger Confederacy sachems sued for peace. \n\n=== Document 6: List of colonial governors of New York ===\nThe territory which would later become the state of New York was settled by European colonists as part of the New Netherland colony (parts of present-day New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware) under the command of the Dutch West India Company in the Seventeenth Century. These colonists were largely of Dutch, Flemish, Walloon, and German stock, but the colony soon became a \"melting pot.\" In 1664, at the onset of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, English forces under Richard Nicolls ousted the Dutch from control of New Netherland, and the territory became part of several different English colonies. Despite one brief year when the Dutch retook the colony (1673\u20131674), New York would remain an English possession until the American colonies declared independence in 1776. \n\n=== Document 7: Nine Men ===\nThe council of Nine Men was a citizens board and a form of representational democracy in New Netherland. It replaced the previous councils, the Twelve Men and the Eight Men. Members of the council were elected in 1647, 1649, 1650 and 1652. On July 26, 1649, eleven current and former members of the board signed the \"Petition of the Commonality of New Netherland\", which requested that the States General take action to encourage economic freedom and force local government like that in the Netherlands, removing the colony from the control of the Dutch West India Company. It became the basis for the municipal government when the city of New Amsterdam received its charter in 1653. \n\n=== Document 8: Tomys Swartwout ===\n'Thomas or Tomys Swartwout (June 1, 1607, Groningen \u2013 1660, Beverwijck) was one of the earliest importers of tobacco from New Netherland to Western and northern Europe, one of earliest settlers of New Netherland (present day United States), and a founder of Midwood (originally Midwout), Brooklyn, New York. \n\n=== Document 9: Twelve Men ===\nThe Council of Twelve Men was a group of 12 men, chosen on 29 August 1641 by the residents of New Netherland to advise the Director of New Netherland, Willem Kieft, on relations with the Native Americans due to the murder of Claes Swits. Although the council was not permanent, it was the first representational form of democracy in the Dutch colony.

Flowers ===\nCommissioner v. Flowers, 326 U.S. 465 (1946), was a Federal income tax case before the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court held that in order to deduct the expense of traveling under \u00a7162, the expense must be incurred while away from home, and must be a reasonable expense necessary or appropriate to the development and pursuit of a trade or business. In this case, the attorney in question could only deduct traveling expenses from her gross income when the railroad's business forced attorney to travel and live temporarily at some place other than the railroad's principal place of business. Where attorney preferred for personal reasons to live in a different state from the location of his employer's principal office, and his duties required frequent trips to that office, the evidence sustained Tax Court's finding that the necessary relation between expenses of such trips and the railroad's business was lacking. \n\n=== Document 2: Circuit court ===\nCircuit court is the name of court systems in several common law jurisdictions. The core concept of circuit courts requires judges to travel to different locales in order to ensure wide visibility and understanding of cases in a region. More generally, some modern circuit courts may also refer to a court which merely holds trials for cases of multiple locations in some rotation. \n\n=== Document 3: Eliot Spitzer ===\nEliot Laurence Spitzer (born June 10, 1959) is a former American Democratic politician and attorney who served as the 54th governor of New York, from January 1, 2007, until his resignation in disgrace fourteen months later on March 17, 2008. Prior to being elected governor of New York, he was elected to two four-year terms as the Attorney General of New York, from 1999 to 2006. Prior to becoming attorney general, Spitzer worked for six years as a prosecutor with the office of the Manhattan district attorney and also worked as an attorney in private practice with several New York law firms. \n\n=== Document 4: North Carolina Attorney General ===\nThe Attorney General of North Carolina is the elected head of the state's Department of Justice. The North Carolina constitution, in Article III Section 7, provides for the election of the Attorney General. http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Legislation/constitution/article3.html By statute, Attorney General's duties include providing legal representation and advice to all state agencies. The parameters of that duty have been the subject of some debate, when, for example, United States Attorney General Eric Holder suggested that state Attorneys General should not squander their state's resources in defense of laws they know to be unconstitutional. By statute, in defense of the public interest, the Attorney General may initiate legal action or intervene in proceedings before any courts, regulatory officers, agencies or bodies \u2014 either state or federal \u2014 on behalf of the state's agencies and citizens. http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByChapter/Chapter_114.pdf The Attorney General also renders legal opinions, either formally or informally, upon all questions of law submitted by the General Assembly, the Governor or any other state officer.

Born to a country gentleman, he was initially educated in Hanmer before moving to Ruthin School aged 12. Rather than going to university he instead worked as a clerk to an attorney, joining the Middle Temple in 1750 and being called to the Bar in 1756.

Flowers ===\nCommissioner v. Flowers, 326 U.S. 465 (1946), was a Federal income tax case before the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court held that in order to deduct the expense of traveling under \u00a7162, the expense must be incurred while away from home, and must be a reasonable expense necessary or appropriate to the development and pursuit of a trade or business. In this case, the attorney in question could only deduct traveling expenses from her gross income when the railroad's business forced attorney to travel and live temporarily at some place other than the railroad's principal place of business. Where attorney preferred for personal reasons to live in a different state from the location of his employer's principal office, and his duties required frequent trips to that office, the evidence sustained Tax Court's finding that the necessary relation between expenses of such trips and the railroad's business was lacking. \n\n=== Document 2: Circuit court ===\nCircuit court is the name of court systems in several common law jurisdictions. The core concept of circuit courts requires judges to travel to different locales in order to ensure wide visibility and understanding of cases in a region. More generally, some modern circuit courts may also refer to a court which merely holds trials for cases of multiple locations in some rotation. \n\n=== Document 3: Eliot Spitzer ===\nEliot Laurence Spitzer (born June 10, 1959) is a former American Democratic politician and attorney who served as the 54th governor of New York, from January 1, 2007, until his resignation in disgrace fourteen months later on March 17, 2008.

Prior to becoming attorney general, Spitzer worked for six years as a prosecutor with the office of the Manhattan district attorney and also worked as an attorney in private practice with several New York law firms. \n\n=== Document 4: North Carolina Attorney General ===\nThe Attorney General of North Carolina is the elected head of the state's Department of Justice. The North Carolina constitution, in Article III Section 7, provides for the election of the Attorney General. http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Legislation/constitution/article3.html By statute, Attorney General's duties include providing legal representation and advice to all state agencies. The parameters of that duty have been the subject of some debate, when, for example, United States Attorney General Eric Holder suggested that state Attorneys General should not squander their state's resources in defense of laws they know to be unconstitutional. By statute, in defense of the public interest, the Attorney General may initiate legal action or intervene in proceedings before any courts, regulatory officers, agencies or bodies \u2014 either state or federal \u2014 on behalf of the state's agencies and citizens. http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByChapter/Chapter_114.pdf The Attorney General also renders legal opinions, either formally or informally, upon all questions of law submitted by the General Assembly, the Governor or any other state officer.

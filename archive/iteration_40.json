  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using a hierarchical rule extraction and application approach, driven by the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into extracting high-level transformation rules, refining them with local context analysis, and then applying the refined rules to generate the transformed grid. The agent roles involved are primarily that of a grid transformation expert. The `call_llm` function interfaces with the Gemini API to generate content based on prompts and system instructions. The overall workflow involves `main` calling `solve_grid_transformation`, which sequentially calls `call_llm` to extract the high-level rule, analyze the local context, and apply the refined rule, before returning the transformed grid.",

      "output": "Extracted High-Level Rule: The grid transformation involves a complex rearrangement of elements and the introduction of a new value '8'. The transformation appears to be dependent on the relative positions and values of the original elements. In general, the columns containing values other than zero are shifted, and 8s are introduced in specific columns related to these shifts.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the observed pattern and potential high-level rule:\n\n1. **Value '8' Insertion:** The digit '8' is inserted at the column index 5 in the transformed grid of Example 1, and at index zero in Examples 2 & 3. This location may relate to the initial positions of the non-zero elements in the original grid.\n\n2. **Column Shifting/Rearrangement:** Columns with non-zero values (2,3) are shifted to other locations in the grid. Example 1: values shift from cols 0, 10, 12 to cols 6, 10, 8. Examples 2 & 3: shift of values 2 & 3.\n\n3. **Zero Padding:** The remaining grid positions are filled with zeros.\n\nTherefore, a more refined high-level rule is:\n\nHigh-Level Rule: Identify columns with non-zero elements in the input grid. Shift these columns (with elements 2 and 3) according to a specific pattern that depends on their original locations and introduce the value '8' into other columns, then fill the rest of grid with 0s.\n\nThe complexity of the transformation requires a more in-depth column by column analysis to reveal the detailed algorithm that governs the transformation.\n\nLocal Context Analysis: Okay, let's analyze the local context of the provided training examples and the test input to refine our high-level rule for the grid transformation.\n\n**Refined High-Level Rule (Based on previous analysis):**\n\n1.  **'8' Insertion:** The digit '8' is inserted into a specific column based on the location of non-zero elements.\n2.  **Column Shifting:** Columns containing non-zero elements (2 and 3) are shifted.\n3.  **Zero Padding:** The remaining positions are filled with zeros.\n\n**Local Context Analysis and Rule Refinement:**\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n    *   Input contains '2' in column 10 and '3' in columns 1 and 2 and 3 and 12.\n    *   Output has '8' in column 5, the '2' shifted to column 10, the '3' shifted to column 6, 7, 8.\n    *   The zero padding fills rest of the grid.\n\n*   **Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n    *   Input contains '2' in column 0 and '3' in column 0 and 1 and 3.\n    *   Output has '8' in column 0, the '3' and '2' shifted to the bottom of the grid.\n    *   The zero padding fills rest of the grid.\n\n*   **Example 3 Analysis:**\n\n    *   Input contains '2' in column 0 and '3' in column 0 and 1 and 2.\n    *   Output has '8' in column 0, the '3' and '2' shifted to the top of the grid.\n    *   The zero padding fills rest of the grid.\n\n*   **Observations:**\n\n    *   The columns containing 2 and 3 are moved, and an '8' is placed in another column.\n    *   The '8' location and the destination of the 2 and 3 columns appears related to the *relative positions* of the 2 and 3 in the input.\n    *   In Example 2 and 3, the 8s are inserted at a specific row, and the 2s and 3s follow.\n    *   In example 1, 8 is inserted at column 5, and the 2s and 3s are shifted as well.\n\n**Revised High-Level Rule:**\n\n1. Identify columns containing '2' and '3' in the input grid.\n2. Introduce '8' at specific column based on prior transformations in training examples.\n3. Re-arrange '2' and '3' in other columns based on prior transformations in training examples.\n4. Fill the rest of the grid with zeros.\n\n**Applying the Refined Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nInput Grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n1.  **Identify Columns with 2 and 3:** '2' is in column 4, '3' is in columns 12, 13.\n2.  **'8' Insertion:** From Example 1, the 8 is inserted at column 5.\n3.  **Re-arrange '2' and '3':** From Example 1, the '2' remains in its column and the '3' shifts to column 6, 7, 8. Based on the training set, the 3 shifts to column 6 and 7.\n\n**Predicted Output Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nTransformed Grid Text: ```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_START\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

        "output": "Extracted High-Level Rule: The grid transformation involves a complex rearrangement of elements and the introduction of a new value '8'. The transformation appears to be dependent on the relative positions and values of the original elements. In general, the columns containing values other than zero are shifted, and 8s are introduced in specific columns related to these shifts.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the observed pattern and potential high-level rule:\n\n1. **Value '8' Insertion:** The digit '8' is inserted at the column index 5 in the transformed grid of Example 1, and at index zero in Examples 2 & 3. This location may relate to the initial positions of the non-zero elements in the original grid.\n\n2. **Column Shifting/Rearrangement:** Columns with non-zero values (2,3) are shifted to other locations in the grid. Example 1: values shift from cols 0, 10, 12 to cols 6, 10, 8. Examples 2 & 3: shift of values 2 & 3.\n\n3. **Zero Padding:** The remaining grid positions are filled with zeros.\n\nTherefore, a more refined high-level rule is:\n\nHigh-Level Rule: Identify columns with non-zero elements in the input grid. Shift these columns (with elements 2 and 3) according to a specific pattern that depends on their original locations and introduce the value '8' into other columns, then fill the rest of grid with 0s.\n\nThe complexity of the transformation requires a more in-depth column by column analysis to reveal the detailed algorithm that governs the transformation.\n\nLocal Context Analysis: Okay, let's analyze the local context of the provided training examples and the test input to refine our high-level rule for the grid transformation.\n\n**Refined High-Level Rule (Based on previous analysis):**\n\n1.  **'8' Insertion:** The digit '8' is inserted into a specific column based on the location of non-zero elements.\n2.  **Column Shifting:** Columns containing non-zero elements (2 and 3) are shifted.\n3.  **Zero Padding:** The remaining positions are filled with zeros.\n\n**Local Context Analysis and Rule Refinement:**\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n    *   Input contains '2' in column 10 and '3' in columns 1 and 2 and 3 and 12.\n    *   Output has '8' in column 5, the '2' shifted to column 10, the '3' shifted to column 6, 7, 8.\n    *   The zero padding fills rest of the grid.\n\n*   **Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n    *   Input contains '2' in column 0 and '3' in column 0 and 1 and 3.\n    *   Output has '8' in column 0, the '3' and '2' shifted to the bottom of the grid.\n    *   The zero padding fills rest of the grid.\n\n*   **Example 3 Analysis:**\n\n    *   Input contains '2' in column 0 and '3' in column 0 and 1 and 2.\n    *   Output has '8' in column 0, the '3' and '2' shifted to the top of the grid.\n    *   The zero padding fills rest of the grid.\n\n*   **Observations:**\n\n    *   The columns containing 2 and 3 are moved, and an '8' is placed in another column.\n    *   The '8' location and the destination of the 2 and 3 columns appears related to the *relative positions* of the 2 and 3 in the input.\n    *   In Example 2 and 3, the 8s are inserted at a specific row, and the 2s and 3s follow.\n    *   In example 1, 8 is inserted at column 5, and the 2s and 3s are shifted as well.\n\n**Revised High-Level Rule:**\n\n1. Identify columns containing '2' and '3' in the input grid.\n2. Introduce '8' at specific column based on prior transformations in training examples.\n3. Re-arrange '2' and '3' in other columns based on prior transformations in training examples.\n4. Fill the rest of the grid with zeros.\n\n**Applying the Refined Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nInput Grid:\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n1.  **Identify Columns with 2 and 3:** '2' is in column 4, '3' is in columns 12, 13.\n2.  **'8' Insertion:** From Example 1, the 8 is inserted at column 5.\n3.  **Re-arrange '2' and '3':** From Example 1, the '2' remains in its column and the '3' shifts to column 6, 7, 8. Based on the training set, the 3 shifts to column 6 and 7.\n\n**Predicted Output Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nTransformed Grid Text: ```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_START\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and capability mappings.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system correctly identifies the rule of extracting the center element from 3x3 blocks. However, it makes a mistake in applying the rule, calculating the center element for one of the blocks incorrectly.  This indicates a problem with execution or applying the extracted rule precisely. The provided code block in the output contains the correct 3x3 matrix and central element value, but the predicted output grid has an incorrect value.\n\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system identifies column shifting and the insertion of the value '8'. However, it struggles to correctly determine the placement of '3' and '8', revealing weaknesses in handling spatial constraints and accurately generalizing from training examples.  The system attempts to analyze the training examples to derive where to shift the elements, but its analysis is flawed.\n\n*   **Sample ID 2:** This sample exhibits a success in generating Python code to transform the grid based on expanding each non-zero cell into a 3x7 block. However, the output prints the *code* that produces the answer, not the answer itself, suggesting an issue with execution or output formatting. The extracted rule is good and the code block represents the rule.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a foundational understanding of pattern recognition and rule extraction, as evidenced by its ability to identify high-level rules from training data and even generate functional code. However, its ability to apply these rules consistently and accurately, especially when dealing with complex spatial relationships or constraints, is severely limited. The system struggles with generalization, leading to frequent errors on unseen test inputs. While code generation is a strength, the system needs to ensure the generated code is properly *executed* and formatted for output.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Rule Extraction from Examples:** The system excels at identifying overarching patterns in the training data.\n*   **Code Generation (Potential):** The system can sometimes generate code that reflects the extracted rules, but the generated code is not always executed correctly.\n*   **Local Context Analysis:** The system attempts to analyze local context, although this analysis is not always accurate or effective.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The system consistently fails to generalize extracted rules to unseen inputs.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system's ability to respect implicit constraints based on spatial relationships is very weak.\n*   **Execution and Output Formatting:** The system sometimes outputs code instead of executing it, and the outputs may be in an unformatted state.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**, specifically related to spatial reasoning and constraint handling. Without improving the system's ability to correctly predict new outputs from extracted rules and spatial reasoning the system will have poor performance.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Spatial Reasoning Module:** This module should use techniques like graph representations or convolutional neural networks to explicitly reason about spatial relationships between grid elements. The goal is to move beyond simple pattern matching and towards understanding the *geometry* of the transformations.\n\n2.  **Integrate a Constraint Solver:**  Before outputting a transformed grid, use a constraint solver (e.g., using a library like Z3) to verify that the proposed solution adheres to all spatial and value-based constraints implied by the problem. This will act as a \"sanity check\" and prevent many of the misplacement errors.\n\n3.  **Implement a Robust Error Handler and Code Execution Checker:** The system needs to reliably execute the generated code and output the *result* of the execution, not the code itself. Implement error handling to catch any runtime errors and retry or adapt the code generation process if necessary.\n\n4.  **Refine Rule Extraction with Attribute Analysis:** Augment the rule extraction process to include detailed analysis of grid element attributes (row, column, value, neighbors, etc.).  Rules should be conditional and based on these attributes. For example: \"If the value 'X' is in the top-left corner, then...\"\n\n5.  **Implement a Testing and Validation Pipeline:** Create a rigorous testing pipeline with a diverse set of test cases that cover a wide range of patterns and complexities. Use this pipeline to automatically evaluate the system's performance after each iteration and track progress.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is currently **stable, but not improving**. The system shows potential in rule extraction and code generation, but these abilities are hampered by poor generalization and constraint handling. Without addressing these weaknesses, the system will remain stuck at its current accuracy level.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using a two-step LLM-driven approach: rule extraction followed by rule application. The `solve_grid_transformation` function first uses `call_llm` to extract a transformation rule from example grids, then calls `call_llm` again to apply this rule to the test grid. If the rule application fails, a simple fallback transformation is applied.\n\nThe `call_llm` function interacts with the Gemini API to generate text based on prompts and system instructions. Main calls `solve_grid_transformation` to kick off the grid transformation process.",

However, it struggles to define constraints for placement of specific values on the edges of the grid.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Application:** The system tends to apply the transformation pattern in a generalized way rather than precisely mirroring the relationships observed in the training examples.\n*   **Weak Constraint Handling for edge placement:** The system struggles to precisely implement the spatial constraints and boundary conditions as presented in training examples.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe system consistently introduces deviations in the transformed grid, specifically in boundary placement and value assignment when compared to the golden answers. The deviation appears as slight offsets. In sample 2, the placement of the \"4\" values at the bottom of the matrix is shifted from the correct positions.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the inaccurate application of the learned pattern in the grid transformation. The system fails to precisely replicate the spatial relationships and value placements from the training examples in the test input transformation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Improve the system's ability to define and enforce constraints during the grid transformation. This includes accurately identifying spatial relationships, boundary conditions, and value placement rules.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Enhance the solution verification process to rigorously check for adherence to all constraints and patterns learned from the training examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a constraint satisfaction mechanism:** Introduce a constraint satisfaction solver that explicitly models the spatial relationships and value placement rules. This mechanism would ensure that the generated grid adheres to all constraints derived from the training examples.\n2.  **Implement spatial reasoning and localization:** Add a spatial localization model which will help define the position of values on the edges of the grid based on their positions in the training examples.\n3.  **Improve verification by using pixel-by-pixel comparison to golden answer:** When training the system, penalize deviations from the golden answers on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This will force it to reproduce the examples more closely.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample 1:**\n*   Solution Verification: Failed to verify the solution against the required constraints.\n\n**Sample 2:**\n*   Solution Generation: Failed to generate a solution that fully adheres to the input's constraints\n*   Solution Verification: Failed to verify the solution against the required constraints.\n",

The overall structure is correct, but the placement of the \"4\" values is slightly off, and the distribution of 3s and 6s is not accurate.\n*   **Sample 3 (Incorrect):** This output showcases the weakness in fine-grained detail. The placement of the \"4\" values is slightly off, and the distribution of 3s and 6s is not accurate.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of pattern recognition and grid transformation but struggles with precise application of learned patterns, especially when dealing with spatial constraints and boundary conditions. Its ability to generate code (grid representation) is a plus, but the code generated is often inaccurate.  The lack of explicit error messages during runtime suggests that the errors stem from logic and reasoning flaws rather than coding errors.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:**  The ability to identify and apply general patterns from training examples.\n*   **Code Generation:**  The capability to generate code representing the transformed grid.\n*   **Grid Transformation:** The ability to perform the basic transformations of the grid based on provided examples.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Application:**  Failing to precisely replicate spatial relationships and value placements.  This is the *most* significant weakness.\n*   **Weak Constraint Handling:**  Struggling to define and enforce spatial constraints, particularly those involving edge placement.\n*   **Solution Verification:**  Failing to adequately verify the generated solution against the learned constraints.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**The single most important capability to focus on improving is Inaccurate Pattern Application.**  Addressing this issue will have the most significant impact on the overall accuracy of the system.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Focus on Spatial Reasoning and Localization:** Prioritize the implementation of spatial reasoning and localization. The current system can generate code to generate grids, but it cannot accurately place the values on the edge of the grid.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Implement a module that analyzes the training examples and extracts explicit spatial relationships between elements in the grid (e.g., \"value 'X' is always two positions to the left of value 'Y'\").\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Implement a spatial localization model which will help define the position of values on the edges of the grid based on their positions in the training examples.\n    *   **Evaluation Metric:** Measure the accuracy of spatial relationship extraction and the resulting grid transformations.\n\n2.  **Refine Constraint Satisfaction Mechanism:** Fine-tune the constraint satisfaction mechanism to focus on placement and relationships derived from the input examples.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Use a constraint satisfaction solver that explicitly models the spatial relationships and value placement rules. This mechanism would ensure that the generated grid adheres to all constraints derived from the training examples.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Use an existing constraint satisfaction library or build a custom one tailored to the grid transformation task. The constraints should be dynamically generated based on the training examples.\n    *   **Evaluation Metric:** Measure the percentage of generated grids that satisfy all defined constraints.\n\n3.  **Enhance Solution Verification:** Implement a more robust solution verification process that includes a pixel-by-pixel comparison to the golden answers during training.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Implement pixel-by-pixel comparison by penalizing deviations from the golden answers on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This will force it to reproduce the examples more closely.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Calculate a pixel-wise difference score between the generated grid and the golden answer.  Use this score as a loss function during training to penalize even minor deviations.\n    *   **Evaluation Metric:** Track the average pixel-wise difference score during training to monitor improvement in solution accuracy.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the current performance (33% accuracy) and identified weaknesses, the capability trend is currently **stable**. To move towards improvement, the actionable recommendations provided need to be implemented and their impact evaluated.\n",

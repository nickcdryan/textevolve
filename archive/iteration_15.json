  "approach_summary": "The script implements a multi-stage LLM-driven approach to answer questions using chain-of-thought reasoning and verification. The problem is decomposed into four main steps: question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The agents in each function act as experts in their respective domains (analysis, extraction, generation, verification).\n\nThe functions used are `main`, `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, `verify_answer`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow, calling `analyze_question` to understand the question, `extract_relevant_passage` to retrieve context, `generate_answer` to formulate an initial answer, and `verify_answer` to refine the response. Each of the *question, passage, and answer functions uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model.\n\nThe overall workflow involves analyzing the input question, extracting a relevant passage from the given text, generating an initial answer based on the extracted passage and question analysis, and finally verifying and correcting the generated answer, leveraging LLMs at each stage.",

It also shows that it has a limited understanding of how to summarize an answer effectively.\n*   **Unproven Robustness:** The system has only been tested with a limited set of inputs. Its ability to handle edge cases, ambiguous language, or more complex reasoning tasks remains unknown.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Abstraction and Summarization of Answers**. Moving beyond literal text extraction to a more nuanced understanding and summarization will significantly enhance the system's usefulness and applicability.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Summarization/Paraphrasing Module:** Integrate a module that can rephrase the extracted information in a concise and natural way. This could involve techniques like abstractive summarization or keyword extraction followed by sentence generation.\n2.  **Introduce Abstraction-Based Test Cases:** Design new test cases that require the system to draw inferences, connect related facts, and formulate answers that are not explicitly stated in the text. Focus on creating questions that necessitate higher-level understanding.\n3.  **Refine Reasoning Trace Generation:** Modify the reasoning trace to include not just the quoted text, but also a brief explanation of *why* that text supports the answer. This would provide a more transparent and informative explanation of the system's reasoning process.\n4.  **Test for Adversarial Examples:** Test the system against questions which are phrased differently but test for the same understanding, or contain irrelevant information intended to confuse the system.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current data, it's difficult to assess the capability trend definitively. The perfect accuracy suggests potential for growth, but further testing with more diverse and challenging datasets is crucial to determine if the capabilities are truly improving or merely stable within a narrow range of tasks. Therefore, I am categorizing the trend as **Unknown/Needs Further Evaluation**.\n",

Its ability to handle more complex questions is unknown.\n*   **Robustness:** The system's performance with ambiguous or adversarial inputs is not yet tested.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accuracy:** The system's perfect accuracy on the provided dataset is its most significant strength.\n*   **Evidence-Based Justification:** Providing direct quotes from the text lends credibility and transparency to the system's reasoning.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Literal Interpretation & Lack of Abstraction:** The system's tendency to rely on direct quotes and lack of paraphrasing suggests a weakness in abstraction and understanding of nuanced meaning. It also shows that it has a limited understanding of how to summarize an answer effectively.\n*   **Unproven Robustness:** The system has only been tested with a limited set of inputs. Its ability to handle edge cases, ambiguous language, or more complex reasoning tasks remains unknown.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Abstraction and Summarization of Answers**. Moving beyond literal text extraction to a more nuanced understanding and summarization will significantly enhance the system's usefulness and applicability.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Summarization/Paraphrasing Module:** Integrate a module that can rephrase the extracted information in a concise and natural way. This could involve techniques like abstractive summarization or keyword extraction followed by sentence generation.\n2.  **Introduce Abstraction-Based Test Cases:** Design new test cases that require the system to draw inferences, connect related facts, and formulate answers that are not explicitly stated in the text. Focus on creating questions that necessitate higher-level understanding.\n3.  **Refine Reasoning Trace Generation:** Modify the reasoning trace to include not just the quoted text, but also a brief explanation of *why* that text supports the answer. This would provide a more transparent and informative explanation of the system's reasoning process.\n4.  **Test for Adversarial Examples:** Test the system against questions which are phrased differently but test for the same understanding, or contain irrelevant information intended to confuse the system.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current data, it's difficult to assess the capability trend definitively. The perfect accuracy suggests potential for growth, but further testing with more diverse and challenging datasets is crucial to determine if the capabilities are truly improving or merely stable within a narrow range of tasks. Therefore, I am categorizing the trend as **Unknown/Needs Further Evaluation**.\n"

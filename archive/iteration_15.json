  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to solve the meeting scheduling problem by breaking it down into distinct steps that use specialized LLM agents that focus on information extraction, constraint gathering, solution finding, solution verification and validating solution time. The main function calls `extract_participants` and `extract_constraints` to parse the input question, then calls `solve_meeting_problem` to find a solution, then calls `verify_solution` and `is_valid_time` to validate the solution. The overall workflow is to extract key information, find a solution using the extracted information, and verify the solution.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for the AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs you've provided:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample 1:** The analysis correctly identifies constraints for Jesse and Megan and attempts to find available 30-minute slots. However, it overlooks several valid slots: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 13:00-13:30, 14:30-15:00, and 16:30-17:00. The solution incorrectly prioritizes the earliest slot while missing other available opportunities. This highlights the flawed time range comparison logic. The response also includes a substantial amount of preamble (i.e. \"Okay, let's break down the problem and find a suitable meeting time.\"), which detracts from the primary utility of the agent.\n*   **Sample 2:** This example demonstrates a constraint handling error. Sandra is unavailable from 9:00-11:00 and 11:30-17:00. However, Emily is free from 9:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, and 14:00-16:30. So a time slot from 11:00-11:30 on Monday will work, but it is not being identified. The system chooses a Tuesday slot, violating Emily's preference to avoid Tuesdays when a Monday slot is actually possible. This suggests a failure to correctly weigh preferences against hard constraints. Like Sample 1, the response also includes a substantial amount of preamble.\n*   **Sample 3:** The system simply provides a single solution, which is Monday 10:00-11:00, and nothing more. This suggests a minimal capability and an incomplete implementation.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a **limited capability** in solving meeting scheduling problems. While it can identify constraints and analyze time slots, it suffers from significant accuracy issues in applying constraints, correctly handling preferences, and scaling to larger problem sizes. The overall performance is below acceptable levels, and immediate improvements are necessary.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Constraint Identification:**  Ability to extract constraints from the problem description.\n*   **Structured Output:** Clear and organized output format.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:**  Frequent errors in determining available time slots due to flawed logic.\n*   **Preference Prioritization:** Inability to correctly balance preferences against hard constraints.\n*   **Scalability:** Likely struggles with more complex scenarios involving more participants.\n*   **Lack of Verification:**  Failure to verify the proposed solution against all constraints.\n*   **Unnecessary Preamble:**  The agent contains unnecessary preamble that detracts from its primary utility.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Improving the accuracy of constraint application** is the most critical area for improvement. Addressing this will have the most significant impact on overall accuracy and reliability.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Deterministic Time Range Comparison Function:** Replace the current (likely LLM-driven) time range comparison logic with a deterministic Python function. This function should accurately calculate available time slots based on busy schedules and meeting duration. It should accept busy schedules and meeting duration as inputs and return a list of available time slots, which the LLM can then use in generating solutions.\n2.  **Develop a Dedicated Verification Agent:** Create a separate verification agent that explicitly checks if the proposed solution satisfies all constraints. This agent should receive the proposed solution, participant schedules, and meeting duration as input and return a boolean indicating validity, along with specific feedback on any violated constraints.\n3.  **Enhance Few-Shot Examples with Edge Cases:**  Expand the few-shot examples in the prompt to cover a wider range of scenarios, including those with conflicting preferences, multiple constraints, and larger participant groups. Specifically, highlight the importance of correctly checking the identified time slot to ensure that it doesn't violate any constraints before returning the final solution.\n4.  **Remove unnecessary Preamble:** Remove any unnecessary preamble such as \"Okay, let's break down the problem and find a suitable meeting time.\" The agent should give a direct solution without conversational filler.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable but unacceptably low**. Without significant changes, the system will continue to produce inaccurate results. The implementation of the recommendations is necessary to drive a positive capability trend.\n",

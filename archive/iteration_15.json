  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLMs to answer questions by decomposing them into multiple sub-questions, extracting answers with confidence scores, and aggregating those answers. It employs a \"Multi-faceted Question Decomposition and Answer Aggregation with Confidence Scoring\" approach. The script uses the `call_llm` function to generate sub-questions, extract answers, synthesize a final answer, and verify the answer, each time providing a distinct system instruction to give the LLM a specific agent role (question decomposer, answer extractor, information synthesizer, answer accuracy validator). The workflow starts by decomposing the original question, extracting the answers to the sub-questions, aggregating these answers, and finally validating the final answer.",

This is evident in sample 2 (success case) where it extracted \"Cobra\" which is partially correct.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Factual Accuracy:** The system struggles to provide correct factual answers in some cases, as seen in sample 0, where the wingspan of *Eugnosta misella* is incorrect.\n2.  **Lack of Integration and Reasoning:** The system doesn't seem to integrate answers from sub-questions effectively to derive the final answer. It often provides answers derived directly from individual sub-questions without deeper reasoning or verification against other sub-questions. In sample 1, the system asks for sub-questions but seems unable to answer them even if provided with information.\n3.  **Contextual Understanding and Granularity:** The system doesn't appear to have a nuanced understanding of answer granularity. In sample 2, \"Cobra\" is accepted even though \"King Cobra\" is more precise. It lacks the mechanism to distinguish between general terms and more specific ones when the context demands specificity.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Factual Knowledge:** The system relies on external knowledge to answer factual sub-questions, and if that knowledge is incorrect, the final answer will also be incorrect.\n2.  **Sub-question integration and verification:** The inability to verify and synthesize the information from multiple sub-questions into a coherent and accurate final answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Dependence on External Knowledge:** The system relies heavily on external information to answer factual questions.\n2.  **Limited Reasoning Capabilities:** The system struggles with integrating information from different sub-questions and performing complex reasoning.\n3. **Prompt Generation:** There appears to be an issue with the prompt generation as the responses for sub-questions are often canned responses instead of being relevant to the original question.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to accurately retrieve and synthesize factual knowledge from external sources and integrate it effectively through reasoning over generated sub-questions to produce a precise final answer.

This engine should be able to identify inconsistencies, infer new facts, and synthesize information into a coherent answer.\n3.  **Improve confidence score calibration:** Adjust the confidence scoring mechanism to better reflect the accuracy and relevance of the information. For example, lower the confidence score for generic answers when a more specific answer is available.\n4.  **Implement a context-aware answer selection mechanism:** This mechanism should be able to analyze the context of the question and select the most appropriate answer based on the required level of detail.\n5.  **Fine-tune prompt generation**: Fine-tune the prompt generation such that the system generates relevant sub-questions instead of canned responses.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed (incorrect wingspan)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (accepted an inaccurate answer)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed (due to the model not understanding context and providing canned responses)\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed (unable to generate a valid answer)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failed (unable to make a decision on the best answer)\n",

(Samples 1 and 2). The model seems to be getting stuck after the initial sub-question generation and is not properly feeding these sub-questions back into itself or an external knowledge source. The phrase \"\"Okay, I'm ready. Please provide the sub-question.\"\" is a common canned response.\n*   **Incorrect Knowledge Retrieval:** Even when the system attempts to answer a factual sub-question, it might retrieve incorrect information (Sample 0: wingspan of *Eugnosta misella*). This highlights a reliance on potentially flawed knowledge sources.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Awareness:** Even when somewhat correct information is obtained, the system often doesn't refine the answer based on the context of the original question (Sample 2: accepting \"Cobra\" instead of \"King Cobra\").\n*   **Confidence Score Misalignment:** Confidence scores don't always align with the accuracy of the extracted information. The system expresses high confidence (e.g., confidence 10) even when factual accuracy is questionable.\n* **Prompt Issues:** The prompts being used to answer the sub-questions are not leading to successful responses.\n*   **Reasoning Failure:** The system struggles to connect answers from different sub-questions to arrive at a more informed final answer. The answers from sub-questions are not being effectively reasoned over.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates potential in decomposing questions and generating sub-questions. However, its overall capability is significantly hampered by inaccurate knowledge, flawed reasoning, poor prompt design, and an inability to integrate information effectively. The accuracy score of 0.33 accurately reflects the system's current limitations.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Sub-question Decomposition:** The system can break down complex questions into factual, hypothetical, and clarifying sub-questions.\n*   **Confidence Scoring (Potential):** While currently misaligned, the concept of confidence scores is valuable for indicating reliability.\n*   **Answer Extraction (Basic):** The system *attempts* to extract answers, indicating some information retrieval capability.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Factual Inaccuracy:**  The system's reliance on external knowledge sources without proper verification leads to incorrect answers.\n*   **Reasoning & Integration Failure:** The system fails to synthesize information from sub-questions and perform logical reasoning. This is the most impactful weakness.\n*   **Poor Prompt Design:** The system does not create prompts that allow the sub-questions to be answered, and appears to be stuck in a loop waiting for sub-questions.\n*   **Contextual Understanding Deficiency:** The system lacks nuanced contextual understanding, resulting in oversimplified or inaccurate answers.\n*   **Confidence Score Miscalibration:** Confidence scores are often detached from actual accuracy.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Reasoning & Integration** capabilities. Unless the system can effectively synthesize the extracted information to produce an informed and accurate final answer, the other capabilities are of little value. Improving the system's reasoning ability can potentially mitigate the issue of inaccurate source knowledge, as the model could be taught to consider and reconcile multiple conflicting data points. Improving the prompt design so that the sub-questions can be answered by the system is also of key importance.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Source Fact-Checking Mechanism:**  Before accepting information from any source, cross-reference it with at least two other reputable sources.  If discrepancies exist, flag the information and attempt to resolve the conflict using a pre-defined logic (e.g., prioritize sources with higher credibility, consider the majority opinion).\n2.  **Develop a Dedicated Reasoning Engine:** Design a separate module specifically for reasoning over the extracted sub-question answers. This engine should:\n    *   Identify inconsistencies in the extracted information.\n    *   Infer new facts based on the extracted information.\n    *   Synthesize the information into a coherent, accurate answer.\n    *   Track provenance of information and confidence levels through reasoning steps.\n3.  **Fine-tune Prompt Generation:** The system is getting stuck after generating the sub-questions and providing canned responses. Fine-tune the prompts such that the system is able to generate relevant sub-questions and receive answers to those sub-questions.\n4.  **Implement a Contextual Answer Refinement Module:**  After generating a preliminary answer, implement a module that refines the answer based on the original question's context. This module should consider:\n    *   Required level of detail (e.g., specific vs. general).\n    *   Any constraints or limitations specified in the original question.\n    *   Semantic relationships between the answer and the question.\n5.  **Recalibrate Confidence Scores:** Adjust the confidence scoring mechanism to reflect true accuracy and relevance. Explore using a separate, trained model to predict the confidence score of an answer based on features like:\n    *   Source credibility.\n    *   Consistency with other extracted information.\n    *   Number of reasoning steps involved.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **Stable, but Unsatisfactory**. While the system exhibits some promising capabilities, the critical weaknesses prevent it from being truly useful. The implementation of the actionable recommendations above is crucial to see an improving trend in the next iteration. Without these changes, it is likely the capabilities will remain stagnant.\n",

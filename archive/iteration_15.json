  "approach_summary": "The script solves a question by decomposing it into sub-questions, extracting relevant information to answer them, and synthesizing a final answer, using chain-of-thought prompting with examples. Each stage (decomposition, extraction, synthesis) uses a specific LLM agent role and validates the output using another LLM call. The workflow involves `main` calling `decompose_question`, then `extract_information`, then `synthesize_answer`; each of these functions calls `call_llm` to interact with the LLM and also validate the response from the LLM.",

After trailing 12-10 in the third quarter, the Lions would take a 16-12 lead with another touchdown and a failed 2-point conversion. Turnovers again doomed the Lions. Matthew Stafford threw an interception, the third Lions turnover, late in the game, with Detroit clinging to a 16-15 lead. That would give Justin Tucker a chance at a 61-yard field goal, which he converted to give Baltimore an 18-16 victory. With the shocking loss, the Lions fell to 7-7 and third place within their division.",

      "original_passage": "Although Satsunan literally means the south of Satsuma Province, the north-eastern group of the \u014csumi Islands formed Tane Province for a brief period in the 8th and 9th centuries and then were merged into \u014csumi Province. The Tokara Islands and the northwestern group of the \u014csumi Islands belonged to Kawanabe District of Satsuma Province. The Amami Islands paid tribute to the Ryukyu Kingdom to the South until they were put under direct control in the late 16th century, but were conquered in 1609 by the Satsuma Domain. In 1879, the Amami Islands became \u014cshima District of Kagoshima Prefecture. The Tokara Islands and the north-western group of the \u014csumi Islands were transferred to \u014cshima District in 1897, and then to Kagoshima District in 1973. After World War II, the Tokara and Amami Islands were put under United States military occupation, which formed the Government of the Northern Ryukyus. The Japanese government fiercely contested the Amami Islands being affiliated with the word \"Ryukyu\", believing that it would lead to a later return of the islands to their control. The Tokara Islands were returned to Japan in 1952, which were followed by the Amami Islands in December 1953.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are present in the provided data.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1. **Numerical Calculation Accuracy:** The system can perform correct arithmetic operations when it extracts the correct numbers. This is evident in the success cases where correct answers are derived through calculation.\n2. **Information Extraction:** The system is generally able to extract relevant numerical and textual information from the passage. This is shown in the successful examples.\n3. **Reasoning in Some Cases:** The system demonstrates reasoning capabilities in some instances, as evidenced by the inclusion of a \"Reasoning\" section explaining its answer in success cases.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Misinterpretation of Questions Requiring Numerical Comparison:** The system struggles to correctly interpret questions that ask for the *difference* between two values or involve comparing values and then performing a calculation. It sometimes extracts the wrong values or misinterprets which values to subtract from each other.\n2. **Semantic Equivalence:** The system doesn't consistently recognize semantic equivalence in answers, especially regarding nouns (e.g., \"Novgorod\" vs. \"Novgorodians\").\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Accurate Numerical Information Extraction and Question Interpretation:** The primary bottleneck is the accurate extraction of relevant numerical information from the text, coupled with correct interpretation of the question's specific requirement (e.g., find the *difference*, find a *percentage of what is not*).\n2. **Lack of Semantic Understanding:** The system's limited understanding of semantic nuances leads to incorrect answers when synonyms or related terms are used (e.g., city vs. people from the city).\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Incorrect Calculation of Differences:** In sample 2 and 9, the error stems from calculating the incorrect differences.\n2. **Confusion Between Entity and Group:** In sample 4, there's a misunderstanding between the entity \"Novgorod\" (the city) and its inhabitants \"Novgorodians\".\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe single most critical problem is the inaccurate extraction of numerical values relevant to answering questions that require mathematical operations such as finding the difference between values, or calculating percentages. The accurate identification of what values to compare/operate on is key.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Question Decomposition and Value Extraction:** Improve the system's ability to decompose complex questions into simpler steps and extract the numerical values *specifically* required for each step.\n2. **Semantic Understanding and Entity Recognition:** Enhance semantic understanding to recognize synonyms and related entities, differentiating between a place and its inhabitants.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a Question Decomposition Module:** This module should break down complex questions into a series of simpler questions that can be answered individually. For example, \"How many more yards was Nate Kaedings second field goal over his first?\" can be decomposed into: \"How many yards was Nate Kaeding's second field goal?\", \"How many yards was Nate Kaeding's first field goal?\", and \"What is the difference between these two values?\".\n2. **Develop a Numerical Value Extraction and Validation Module:** After question decomposition, this module should extract the numerical values relevant to *each* sub-question. Implement checks to validate that the extracted values are of the correct type and within a reasonable range. If there are multiple possible numerical values, prioritize values which are related to the entities in the question.\n3. **Enhance Semantic Understanding with Knowledge Graph Integration:** Integrate a knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata) to improve semantic understanding. This will allow the system to identify synonyms, related entities, and perform better named entity recognition and disambiguation.\n4. **Add Print Statements for Debugging:** Add print statements throughout the code to display the intermediate values and reasoning steps. This will greatly help in debugging future errors by tracing the system's reasoning path. For instance, when a numerical calculation is performed, print the two numbers being used, the operation being performed, and the final result, alongside the question ID.\n5. **Implement Unit Tests:** Create unit tests for each component, particularly those involved in question parsing, numerical extraction, and calculation. This will ensure the individual components are working correctly.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n*   **Sample 4:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample 9:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided information.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs, while limited, corroborate the error analysis. The first output, \"10\", suggests a possible numerical answer derived from a calculation. This highlights the system's attempt at numerical processing.\n\n*   **Output 1 (\"10\"):**  This output's correctness is unknown without the original question. It *might* be a correct calculation or a miscalculated value based on faulty extraction or reasoning.\n*   **Output 2 (\"African American\"):** This indicates a successful classification task based on relative comparison, along with a successful reasoning step. The system identifies the smaller percentage correctly and provides a logical explanation. This aligns with the reported strength of numerical calculation accuracy *when* the correct numbers are extracted.\n*   **Output 3 (\"27\"):** Similar to Output 1, the correctness of this numerical answer is unknown. It requires context.  It again suggests an attempt at numerical reasoning and potentially calculation.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   The presence of both potentially correct (\"African American\") and unknown (\"10\", \"27\") outputs points to inconsistency.  The error analysis highlighted specific weaknesses (misinterpretation of numerical comparisons, semantic understanding) that likely contribute to this inconsistency.\n*   The \"Reasoning\" section in Output 2 is significant.  It suggests that the system can articulate its process in some cases.  Capturing and analyzing these reasoning steps systematically is crucial for understanding both successes and failures.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the AI system demonstrates a *moderate* level of capability in question answering, with strengths in information extraction and basic numerical calculation. However, its performance is significantly hampered by weaknesses in interpreting complex questions, accurate numerical extraction, semantic understanding, and consistent reasoning. The provided sample outputs suggest that when the correct information is extracted, the system can perform basic reasoning. However, its inability to always correctly extract and interpret information drastically reduces its overall performance.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Reasoning Explanation Generation (when successful):** The system's ability to provide a rationale for its answer is a significant strength. Preserving and expanding this capability will improve transparency and debuggability.\n*   **Numerical Calculation (conditional):** The system can perform calculations *if* the correct numbers are extracted. This means the computational engine itself is relatively sound, but its accuracy relies heavily on the preceding information extraction and question interpretation stages.\n*   **Information Extraction (partial):** The system is generally capable of extracting relevant information. The critical issue is *accurate* extraction of *specific* numerical data required for calculations/comparisons.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Numerical Extraction:** This is the most critical weakness.  The system fails to consistently extract the *correct* numerical values relevant to the question.\n*   **Poor Question Interpretation:** The system often misinterprets questions, particularly those involving comparisons (finding differences, percentages) or complex relationships between entities.\n*   **Lack of Robust Semantic Understanding:**  The system struggles with nuances in language (synonyms, related entities) which leads to incorrect answers.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Numerical Information Extraction and Question Interpretation.** Addressing this bottleneck will have the most significant impact on overall system performance. It's the foundation upon which the other capabilities (calculation, reasoning) depend.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis and the original recommendations, here are specific actions for the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Question Decomposition (Priority: High):**\n    *   **Action:** Create a module that takes a question as input and breaks it down into simpler sub-questions.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Use rule-based techniques or train a sequence-to-sequence model to perform the decomposition.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) are present in the provided data.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1. **Numerical Calculation Accuracy:** The system can perform correct arithmetic operations when it extracts the correct numbers. This is evident in the success cases where correct answers are derived through calculation.\n2. **Information Extraction:** The system is generally able to extract relevant numerical and textual information from the passage. This is shown in the successful examples.\n3. **Reasoning in Some Cases:** The system demonstrates reasoning capabilities in some instances, as evidenced by the inclusion of a \"Reasoning\" section explaining its answer in success cases.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Misinterpretation of Questions Requiring Numerical Comparison:** The system struggles to correctly interpret questions that ask for the *difference* between two values or involve comparing values and then performing a calculation. It sometimes extracts the wrong values or misinterprets which values to subtract from each other.\n2. **Semantic Equivalence:** The system doesn't consistently recognize semantic equivalence in answers, especially regarding nouns (e.g., \"Novgorod\" vs. \"Novgorodians\").\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Accurate Numerical Information Extraction and Question Interpretation:** The primary bottleneck is the accurate extraction of relevant numerical information from the text, coupled with correct interpretation of the question's specific requirement (e.g., find the *difference*, find a *percentage of what is not*).\n2. **Lack of Semantic Understanding:** The system's limited understanding of semantic nuances leads to incorrect answers when synonyms or related terms are used (e.g., city vs. people from the city).\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Incorrect Calculation of Differences:** In sample 2 and 9, the error stems from calculating the incorrect differences.\n2. **Confusion Between Entity and Group:** In sample 4, there's a misunderstanding between the entity \"Novgorod\" (the city) and its inhabitants \"Novgorodians\".\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe single most critical problem is the inaccurate extraction of numerical values relevant to answering questions that require mathematical operations such as finding the difference between values, or calculating percentages. The accurate identification of what values to compare/operate on is key.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Question Decomposition and Value Extraction:** Improve the system's ability to decompose complex questions into simpler steps and extract the numerical values *specifically* required for each step.\n2. **Semantic Understanding and Entity Recognition:** Enhance semantic understanding to recognize synonyms and related entities, differentiating between a place and its inhabitants.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a Question Decomposition Module:** This module should break down complex questions into a series of simpler questions that can be answered individually. For example, \"How many more yards was Nate Kaedings second field goal over his first?\" can be decomposed into: \"How many yards was Nate Kaeding's second field goal?\", \"How many yards was Nate Kaeding's first field goal?\", and \"What is the difference between these two values?\".\n2. **Develop a Numerical Value Extraction and Validation Module:** After question decomposition, this module should extract the numerical values relevant to *each* sub-question. Implement checks to validate that the extracted values are of the correct type and within a reasonable range. If there are multiple possible numerical values, prioritize values which are related to the entities in the question.\n3. **Enhance Semantic Understanding with Knowledge Graph Integration:** Integrate a knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata) to improve semantic understanding. This will allow the system to identify synonyms, related entities, and perform better named entity recognition and disambiguation.\n4. **Add Print Statements for Debugging:** Add print statements throughout the code to display the intermediate values and reasoning steps. This will greatly help in debugging future errors by tracing the system's reasoning path. For instance, when a numerical calculation is performed, print the two numbers being used, the operation being performed, and the final result, alongside the question ID.\n5. **Implement Unit Tests:** Create unit tests for each component, particularly those involved in question parsing, numerical extraction, and calculation. This will ensure the individual components are working correctly.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n*   **Sample 4:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample 9:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided information.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs, while limited, corroborate the error analysis. The first output, \"10\", suggests a possible numerical answer derived from a calculation. This highlights the system's attempt at numerical processing.\n\n*   **Output 1 (\"10\"):**  This output's correctness is unknown without the original question. It *might* be a correct calculation or a miscalculated value based on faulty extraction or reasoning.\n*   **Output 2 (\"African American\"):** This indicates a successful classification task based on relative comparison, along with a successful reasoning step. The system identifies the smaller percentage correctly and provides a logical explanation. This aligns with the reported strength of numerical calculation accuracy *when* the correct numbers are extracted.\n*   **Output 3 (\"27\"):** Similar to Output 1, the correctness of this numerical answer is unknown. It requires context.  It again suggests an attempt at numerical reasoning and potentially calculation.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n*   The presence of both potentially correct (\"African American\") and unknown (\"10\", \"27\") outputs points to inconsistency.  The error analysis highlighted specific weaknesses (misinterpretation of numerical comparisons, semantic understanding) that likely contribute to this inconsistency.\n*   The \"Reasoning\" section in Output 2 is significant.  It suggests that the system can articulate its process in some cases.  Capturing and analyzing these reasoning steps systematically is crucial for understanding both successes and failures.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the AI system demonstrates a *moderate* level of capability in question answering, with strengths in information extraction and basic numerical calculation. However, its performance is significantly hampered by weaknesses in interpreting complex questions, accurate numerical extraction, semantic understanding, and consistent reasoning. The provided sample outputs suggest that when the correct information is extracted, the system can perform basic reasoning. However, its inability to always correctly extract and interpret information drastically reduces its overall performance.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Reasoning Explanation Generation (when successful):** The system's ability to provide a rationale for its answer is a significant strength. Preserving and expanding this capability will improve transparency and debuggability.\n*   **Numerical Calculation (conditional):** The system can perform calculations *if* the correct numbers are extracted. This means the computational engine itself is relatively sound, but its accuracy relies heavily on the preceding information extraction and question interpretation stages.\n*   **Information Extraction (partial):** The system is generally capable of extracting relevant information. The critical issue is *accurate* extraction of *specific* numerical data required for calculations/comparisons.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Numerical Extraction:** This is the most critical weakness.  The system fails to consistently extract the *correct* numerical values relevant to the question.\n*   **Poor Question Interpretation:** The system often misinterprets questions, particularly those involving comparisons (finding differences, percentages) or complex relationships between entities.\n*   **Lack of Robust Semantic Understanding:**  The system struggles with nuances in language (synonyms, related entities) which leads to incorrect answers.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Numerical Information Extraction and Question Interpretation.** Addressing this bottleneck will have the most significant impact on overall system performance. It's the foundation upon which the other capabilities (calculation, reasoning) depend.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nBased on the analysis and the original recommendations, here are specific actions for the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Question Decomposition (Priority: High):**\n    *   **Action:** Create a module that takes a question as input and breaks it down into simpler sub-questions.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Use rule-based techniques or train a sequence-to-sequence model to perform the decomposition. Focus initially on questions involving numerical comparisons (differences, percentages).\n    *   **Testing:**  Create a unit test suite to verify the accuracy of the decomposition for a wide range of question types.\n2.  **Develop Numerical Value Extraction and Validation (Priority: High):**\n    *   **Action:** Create a module that, *after question decomposition*, extracts relevant numerical values from the text.\n    *   **Implementation Details:**\n        *   Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify numerical values.\n        *   Implement rules or train a model to link extracted numbers to entities mentioned in the sub-question (e.g., \"Nate Kaeding's second field goal\" should be linked to the number of yards associated with that entity).\n        *   Add validation checks (e.g., type checking, range checking, unit consistency).\n    *   **Testing:** Develop unit tests to verify the accuracy of number extraction and validation. Include cases with ambiguous or multiple numerical values.\n3.  **Add Extensive Print Statements for Debugging (Priority: High):**\n    *   **Action:** Insert print statements throughout the code to track the flow of information, extracted values, and reasoning steps.\n    *   **Implementation Details:**\n        *   Print the raw input question.\n        *   Print the decomposed sub-questions.\n        *   Print the extracted numerical values for each sub-question.\n        *   Print the results of any calculations.\n        *   Include a unique identifier (e.g., question ID) with each print statement.\n    *   **Benefits:** Makes debugging much easier, allowing you to trace the source of errors.\n4.  **Implement targeted Unit Tests (Priority: Medium):**\n    *   **Action:** Create comprehensive unit tests *specifically* for the modules responsible for question parsing, numerical extraction, and calculation.\n    *   **Focus:** These tests should cover edge cases, boundary conditions, and potential ambiguities in the input data.\n5. **Integrate Knowledge Graph for Semantic Enrichment (Priority: Medium - Long Term):**\n    * **Action:** Integrate a knowledge graph like Wikidata to improve the system's understanding of relationships between entities.\n    * **Implementation details:** Use entity linking techniques to connect entities in the text with corresponding nodes in the knowledge graph.

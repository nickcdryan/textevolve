It uses a multi-example prompting strategy with specialized agents for each step. The function `main` orchestrates the process, calling `extract_data`, `identify_initial_pattern`, `refine_pattern`, and `apply_refined_transformation` sequentially. `call_llm` handles the communication with the Gemini API for each function, providing the prompts and system instructions to guide the LLM's responses.",

It missed the complex spatial relationships and numerical transformations, indicating a failure to generalize beyond memorized examples.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The AI successfully replicates the pattern, transforming numbers within the input grid to '5' in certain rows and '0' in others. This demonstrates a capacity for simple pattern recognition.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The AI simply outputs the original input grid. It failed to shift the rows. This highlights a sensitivity to input order and a lack of abstract understanding of the transformation.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary ability to extract and apply simple patterns. However, it severely lacks the capacity for spatial reasoning, complex transformation logic abstraction, and handling input variations. The system struggles to generalize beyond memorized examples, leading to poor performance on test cases with slightly altered arrangements or more intricate spatial relationships.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Simple Pattern Recognition:** The system can identify and replicate simple patterns from training examples (as seen in Sample ID 1).\n*   **Data Structure Handling:** The system can correctly output the solution in the required JSON format.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Spatial Reasoning & Transformation Logic:** The system struggles to understand and apply spatial relationships and transformation rules beyond memorized examples.\n*   **Input Variation Robustness:** The system is highly sensitive to variations in input structure, leading to failures when the test input deviates slightly from the training examples.\n*   **Generalization:** The system overfits to the training data and fails to generalize effectively to new, unseen inputs.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Spatial Reasoning and Abstract Transformation Logic.** The system needs to move beyond memorization and develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships and transformation rules that can be applied to diverse inputs.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Spatial Feature Extraction:** Integrate CNN layers into the architecture to automatically learn spatial features from the grid data. The system can learn high level features of how numbers are located relative to each other. CNNs are designed to detect patterns in spatial data, which addresses the system's weakness in spatial reasoning.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Add a CNN layer before the existing layers of the model. Experiment with different kernel sizes, number of filters, and pooling strategies.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** Improved feature extraction and better performance on tasks requiring spatial understanding.\n\n2.  **Rule-Based Transformation Layer (Hybrid Approach):** Combine the learning based approach with rule-based constraints. Implement a layer that explicitly attempts to identify transformation rules (e.g., \"shift rows,\" \"mirror columns\"). The system can then use these rules as a guide when transforming the input grid. If the system extracts a rule, it should then apply that rule to the input. Otherwise, it will use the CNN output.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Design a module that attempts to detect and extract simple transformation rules from the training examples. This module would operate in parallel with the neural network and provide additional information about the required transformations.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** Improved ability to understand and apply transformation rules, leading to better generalization.\n\n3.  **Data Augmentation with Spatial Perturbations:** Augment the training data by introducing spatial perturbations, such as rotations, reflections, small shifts, and noise. This will increase the system's robustness to input variations.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Implement a data augmentation pipeline that generates variations of the existing training examples by applying rotations (90, 180, 270 degrees), reflections (horizontal and vertical), and small shifts (1-2 pixels).\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** Increased robustness to input variations and improved generalization performance.\n\n4.  **Visualization of Intermediate Representations:** Implement logging and visualization tools to monitor the intermediate representations within the network. This will help understand how the system is processing the input and identifying potential bottlenecks.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Add print statements and visualization tools to monitor the output of the CNN layer and the transformation rule module. Visualize the extracted features and the applied transformations to identify areas for improvement.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** Improved understanding of the system's internal workings and better debugging capabilities.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, the capability trend is **stable with a tendency towards stagnation**. The system's performance is limited by its fundamental weaknesses in spatial reasoning and transformation logic. Without addressing these weaknesses, further progress will be difficult. Implementing the actionable recommendations above is crucial to shift the trend towards improvement.\n",

    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.33 (1/3)\n*   Error samples: 2/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:** (As provided in the prompt)\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error patterns identified in the original Error Analysis Report.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The AI outputs a grid primarily filled with zeros, failing to replicate the transformation observed in the training data. It missed the complex spatial relationships and numerical transformations, indicating a failure to generalize beyond memorized examples.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The AI successfully replicates the pattern, transforming numbers within the input grid to '5' in certain rows and '0' in others. This demonstrates a capacity for simple pattern recognition.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The AI simply outputs the original input grid. It failed to shift the rows. This highlights a sensitivity to input order and a lack of abstract understanding of the transformation.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary ability to extract and apply simple patterns. However, it severely lacks the capacity for spatial reasoning, complex transformation logic abstraction, and handling input variations. The system struggles to generalize beyond memorized examples, leading to poor performance on test cases with slightly altered arrangements or more intricate spatial relationships.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Simple Pattern Recognition:** The system can identify and replicate simple patterns from training examples (as seen in Sample ID 1).\n*   **Data Structure Handling:** The system can correctly output the solution in the required JSON format.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Spatial Reasoning & Transformation Logic:** The system struggles to understand and apply spatial relationships and transformation rules beyond memorized examples.\n*   **Input Variation Robustness:** The system is highly sensitive to variations in input structure, leading to failures when the test input deviates slightly from the training examples.\n*   **Generalization:** The system overfits to the training data and fails to generalize effectively to new, unseen inputs.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Spatial Reasoning and Abstract Transformation Logic.** The system needs to move beyond memorization and develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships and transformation rules that can be applied to diverse inputs.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Spatial Feature Extraction:** Integrate CNN layers into the architecture to automatically learn spatial features from the grid data. The system can learn high level features of how numbers are located relative to each other. CNNs are designed to detect patterns in spatial data, which addresses the system's weakness in spatial reasoning.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Add a CNN layer before the existing layers of the model. Experiment with different kernel sizes, number of filters, and pooling strategies.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** Improved feature extraction and better performance on tasks requiring spatial understanding.\n\n2.  **Rule-Based Transformation Layer (Hybrid Approach):** Combine the learning based approach with rule-based constraints. Implement a layer that explicitly attempts to identify transformation rules (e.g., \"shift rows,\" \"mirror columns\"). The system can then use these rules as a guide when transforming the input grid. If the system extracts a rule, it should then apply that rule to the input. Otherwise, it will use the CNN output.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Design a module that attempts to detect and extract simple transformation rules from the training examples. This module would operate in parallel with the neural network and provide additional information about the required transformations.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** Improved ability to understand and apply transformation rules, leading to better generalization.\n\n3.  **Data Augmentation with Spatial Perturbations:** Augment the training data by introducing spatial perturbations, such as rotations, reflections, small shifts, and noise. This will increase the system's robustness to input variations.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Implement a data augmentation pipeline that generates variations of the existing training examples by applying rotations (90, 180, 270 degrees), reflections (horizontal and vertical), and small shifts (1-2 pixels).\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** Increased robustness to input variations and improved generalization performance.\n\n4.  **Visualization of Intermediate Representations:** Implement logging and visualization tools to monitor the intermediate representations within the network. This will help understand how the system is processing the input and identifying potential bottlenecks.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Add print statements and visualization tools to monitor the output of the CNN layer and the transformation rule module. Visualize the extracted features and the applied transformations to identify areas for improvement.\n    *   **Expected Outcome:** Improved understanding of the system's internal workings and better debugging capabilities.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, the capability trend is **stable with a tendency towards stagnation**. The system's performance is limited by its fundamental weaknesses in spatial reasoning and transformation logic. Without addressing these weaknesses, further progress will be difficult. Implementing the actionable recommendations above is crucial to shift the trend towards improvement.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting constraints using `extract_constraints`, which leverages an LLM with a system instruction to extract participants, duration, days, and schedules, providing a structured JSON-like output. The `propose_meeting_time` function then proposes a meeting time based on the extracted constraints, using an LLM to check available times and formulate responses, ensuring that the proposed time adheres to the extracted constraints. The overall workflow involves constraint extraction, time slot proposal, and LLM-driven validation, facilitated by the `call_llm` function, which interacts with the Gemini API to generate responses based on provided prompts and system instructions.",

The proposed meeting times (e.g., \"Monday, 10:00-10:30\", \"Monday, 15:00-16:00\", \"Monday, 14:00-14:30\") are generic and lack context related to specific participant schedules.  There's no evidence in the outputs that the system considered individual availability. The consistency of the \"Here is the proposed time:\" prefix across all outputs suggests a template-driven approach, rather than a dynamic solution based on reasoning. This further reinforces the conclusion that the system struggles to actually process and reason about the provided constraints. The fact that times are proposed with no justification or reference to the participants' calendars confirms the lack of constraint handling.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a superficial understanding of scheduling concepts and can generate outputs in a specified format. However, it fundamentally fails at the core task of constraint satisfaction.  It cannot effectively extract, store, and reason about the constraints provided in the input text. The system currently operates more as a structured text generator than a problem solver. Its ability to handle preferences is essentially non-existent.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Output**: The system reliably produces output in the requested \"Here is the proposed time:...\" format.\n*   **Basic Scheduling Awareness**: It understands the concept of scheduling meetings at specific times and days.\n*   **Constraint Adherence (Attempted)**: The system attempts to propose *a* time.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Neglect**: Fails to incorporate schedule constraints leading to scheduling conflicts.\n*   **Preference Ignorance**:  Unable to integrate and act upon meeting preferences.\n*   **Lack of Reasoning**: Shows minimal evidence of logical reasoning to arrive at solutions.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Templates**: The outputs suggest a template-driven approach, lacking dynamic problem-solving.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Constraint Handling**:  This is the most critical area to improve. The entire system hinges on its ability to understand and satisfy constraints. Without this, the system is essentially useless.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Constraint Extraction and Storage Module:**\n    *   Create a dedicated module to parse the input text and extract participant schedules and preferences.\n    *   Represent schedules as time intervals (e.g., using datetime objects or a similar data structure).\n    *   Store these constraints in a structured manner (e.g., a dictionary where keys are participant names and values are lists of busy time intervals).\n    *   Prioritize using LLM extraction instead of brittle regex based parsing\n\n2.  **Develop a Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm:**\n    *   Design an algorithm to identify available time slots by finding intervals where all participants are free.\n    *   The algorithm must explicitly check each potential time slot against the stored constraints.\n    *   Implement a helper function to check if a given time falls within a participant's busy interval.\n\n3.  **Refactor the Output Generation:**\n    *   Move away from a purely template-driven approach.\n    *   Include reasoning steps in the output (even if initially basic) to demonstrate how the system arrived at the proposed time. For example, \"Proposed Time: [time]. [Participant A] is available at this time because... [Participant B] is available because...\".\n\n4. **Introduce Few-Shot Learning with Examples:**\n    * Provide a range of examples demonstrating the correct way to extract the relevant details and correctly resolve and generate the appropriate scheduling output\n    * Examples must range across a number of different scenario variations\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are **stable but fundamentally low**. It generates structured outputs, but lacks the reasoning and constraint handling necessary for practical use. Without significant changes focused on constraint satisfaction, the system will remain ineffective.\n```",

Its ability to handle preferences is essentially non-existent.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Output**: The system reliably produces output in the requested \"Here is the proposed time:...\" format.\n*   **Basic Scheduling Awareness**: It understands the concept of scheduling meetings at specific times and days.\n*   **Constraint Adherence (Attempted)**: The system attempts to propose *a* time.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Neglect**: Fails to incorporate schedule constraints leading to scheduling conflicts.\n*   **Preference Ignorance**:  Unable to integrate and act upon meeting preferences.\n*   **Lack of Reasoning**: Shows minimal evidence of logical reasoning to arrive at solutions.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Templates**: The outputs suggest a template-driven approach, lacking dynamic problem-solving.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Constraint Handling**:  This is the most critical area to improve. The entire system hinges on its ability to understand and satisfy constraints. Without this, the system is essentially useless.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Constraint Extraction and Storage Module:**\n    *   Create a dedicated module to parse the input text and extract participant schedules and preferences.\n    *   Represent schedules as time intervals (e.g., using datetime objects or a similar data structure).\n    *   Store these constraints in a structured manner (e.g., a dictionary where keys are participant names and values are lists of busy time intervals).\n    *   Prioritize using LLM extraction instead of brittle regex based parsing\n\n2.  **Develop a Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm:**\n    *   Design an algorithm to identify available time slots by finding intervals where all participants are free.\n    *   The algorithm must explicitly check each potential time slot against the stored constraints.\n    *   Implement a helper function to check if a given time falls within a participant's busy interval.\n\n3.  **Refactor the Output Generation:**\n    *   Move away from a purely template-driven approach.\n    *   Include reasoning steps in the output (even if initially basic) to demonstrate how the system arrived at the proposed time. For example, \"Proposed Time: [time]. [Participant A] is available at this time because... [Participant B] is available because...\".\n\n4. **Introduce Few-Shot Learning with Examples:**\n    * Provide a range of examples demonstrating the correct way to extract the relevant details and correctly resolve and generate the appropriate scheduling output\n    * Examples must range across a number of different scenario variations\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are **stable but fundamentally low**. It generates structured outputs, but lacks the reasoning and constraint handling necessary for practical use. Without significant changes focused on constraint satisfaction, the system will remain ineffective.\n```"

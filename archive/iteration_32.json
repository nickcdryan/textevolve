  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach, incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning and verification to answer questions. The problem is decomposed into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The agent roles are question analyzer, passage extractor, answer generator, and answer verifier.\n\nThe functions used are: `main` (orchestrates the entire process), `analyze_question` (identifies question type and keywords), `extract_relevant_passage` (extracts relevant text), `generate_answer` (generates an initial answer), `verify_answer` (verifies and corrects the answer), and `call_llm` (interface with the Gemini LLM).\n\nThe overall workflow involves analyzing the question, extracting relevant information, generating an answer, and then verifying the generated answer for accuracy, using the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model at each stage.",

      "question": "PASSAGE:  Eight years after their last game in Indianapolis (a 29-13 victory), the Bears returned to play the Colts in week five. The 43rd game between the two franchise, the Bears trailed the series 19-23, but won the last two games, recently a 41-21 win in 2012. \"An efficient offensive attack\", particularly a rushing-based offense like against the Lions, was a key to success against the Colts defense, according to Jeff Joniak; the Colts allowed the second-highest runs of at least four yards with 51.5 percent. He added the offense should punctuate the run with deep passes, as the Colts were the most penalized defense in the NFL with six pass interference and three personal fouls, along with just four turnovers forced resulting in only three total points. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had to attack Colts quarterback Andrew Luck; Indianapolis was allowing a league-high 15 sacks, was ranked 29th in pass protection efficiency, the second-most hurries (35) the highest number of knockdowns (33) allowed, along with 10 combined false start and holding penalties. Joniak added jet lag could play a factor in the game, as the Colts had lost in London the week before and had no bye week. Connor Barth scored the first points of the game when he kicked a 35-yard field goal on the Bears' opening drive. Adam Vinatieri responded with a 54-yard field goal and the Colts took the lead in the second quarter when Luck threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Allen. Both teams traded field goals on their next drives before Brian Hoyer threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Meredith. With 11 seconds left in the first half, Vinatieri kicked a 26-yard field goal to give Indianapolis the 16-13 lead at halftime. He converted a 41-yard field goal in the third quarter to increase the margin to six points; when Barth tried a 49-yarder on the next series, he missed it wide left, but redeemed himself with a 24-yard kick in the fourth. Hoyer later led the Bears on a 96-yard drive, ending it with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Howard; the drive was the longest touchdown-scoring series since a 97-yard possession against the Steelers in 2009. Luck responded with a 35-yard touchdown pass to T. Y. Hilton, who beat Jacoby Glenn for the score, followed by Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal after Meredith lost a fumble. Down by six points, Hoyer attempted to rally the Bears on one last drive but missed an open Alshon Jeffery on fourth down, throwing an incomplete pass to Meredith. The Colts ran out the clock to end the game. With the loss, the Bears fell to 1-4, their worst five-week start since they started the 2004 season 1-4. They ended the game with 522 offensive yards, the most since they recorded 542 in a 1989 win against the Lions and the most in a loss since 1940.\n\nQUESTION: How many total points were scored in the first half?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji. The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years. While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming. The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death. Food supplies were mismanaged and assigned to individual carriers disproportionate to their weight, and no proper plan for their distribution existed.

The 43rd game between the two franchise, the Bears trailed the series 19-23, but won the last two games, recently a 41-21 win in 2012. \"An efficient offensive attack\", particularly a rushing-based offense like against the Lions, was a key to success against the Colts defense, according to Jeff Joniak; the Colts allowed the second-highest runs of at least four yards with 51.5 percent. He added the offense should punctuate the run with deep passes, as the Colts were the most penalized defense in the NFL with six pass interference and three personal fouls, along with just four turnovers forced resulting in only three total points. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had to attack Colts quarterback Andrew Luck; Indianapolis was allowing a league-high 15 sacks, was ranked 29th in pass protection efficiency, the second-most hurries (35) the highest number of knockdowns (33) allowed, along with 10 combined false start and holding penalties. Joniak added jet lag could play a factor in the game, as the Colts had lost in London the week before and had no bye week. Connor Barth scored the first points of the game when he kicked a 35-yard field goal on the Bears' opening drive. Adam Vinatieri responded with a 54-yard field goal and the Colts took the lead in the second quarter when Luck threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Allen. Both teams traded field goals on their next drives before Brian Hoyer threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Meredith. With 11 seconds left in the first half, Vinatieri kicked a 26-yard field goal to give Indianapolis the 16-13 lead at halftime. He converted a 41-yard field goal in the third quarter to increase the margin to six points; when Barth tried a 49-yarder on the next series, he missed it wide left, but redeemed himself with a 24-yard kick in the fourth. Hoyer later led the Bears on a 96-yard drive, ending it with a 21-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Howard; the drive was the longest touchdown-scoring series since a 97-yard possession against the Steelers in 2009. Luck responded with a 35-yard touchdown pass to T. Y. Hilton, who beat Jacoby Glenn for the score, followed by Vinatieri's 35-yard field goal after Meredith lost a fumble. Down by six points, Hoyer attempted to rally the Bears on one last drive but missed an open Alshon Jeffery on fourth down, throwing an incomplete pass to Meredith. The Colts ran out the clock to end the game. With the loss, the Bears fell to 1-4, their worst five-week start since they started the 2004 season 1-4. They ended the game with 522 offensive yards, the most since they recorded 542 in a 1989 win against the Lions and the most in a loss since 1940.",

      "original_passage": "Since 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. In March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji. The army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years. While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming. The fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death. Food supplies were mismanaged and assigned to individual carriers disproportionate to their weight, and no proper plan for their distribution existed. Some soldiers committed suicide due to the conditions prevalent in the army.",

This is clear in the error case regarding running touchdowns, where it misses one instance.\n*   **Precise Answer Generation:** The system often includes extraneous information or phrasing in its answers, leading to discrepancies with the golden answers. It may also fail to provide a direct numerical answer when expected.\n*   **Lack of Numerical answer generation:** The LLM is not outputting a numerical answer to numerical questions (sample ID 1 and 5)\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inaccurate Counting/Aggregation:** The most critical bottleneck is the system's inability to accurately count and aggregate events described in the passage. This leads to incorrect numerical answers.\n*   **Lack of concise answer generation:** The system is not providing concise answers. Rather, it contains superfluous information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Inaccurate Counting:** This is the most frequent error pattern. The system miscounts the number of touchdowns, field goals, or other events, leading to an incorrect final answer.\n*   **Verbose Output:** The system provides more information than required by the question. This doesn't necessarily make the answer wrong, but leads to errors because the model is supposed to provide *only* the correct answer.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate counting and aggregation of events within the passage**, compounded by **generating verbose answers instead of the concise, expected output.**\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Counting Accuracy:** Implement more robust counting mechanisms to ensure all instances of relevant events are accounted for.\n*   **Answer Conciseness:** Refine the answer generation process to prioritize conciseness and adherence to the expected output format (e.g., providing only the numerical answer when the golden answer is a number).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Counting Logic:** Instead of relying on the language model to implicitly count events, introduce explicit counting logic using code (e.g., using loops and conditional statements to iterate through relevant parts of the extracted information and increment counters).\n2.  **Post-Processing for Answer Formatting:** Implement a post-processing step to ensure the answer is in the expected format. This could involve extracting only the numerical value from the generated text or using regular expressions to remove extraneous phrases.\n3.  **Focus on Conciseness During Prompting:** Modify the prompts to explicitly instruct the language model to provide concise answers and avoid unnecessary explanations.\n4. Add intermediate print statements to determine where the counting is going wrong. This is especially critical for the future.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** solution_verification (fails due to verbose output)\n*   **Sample ID 1:** solution_generation (fails to output a numerical answer)\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information_extraction, solution_generation (fails to extract the correct number of running touchdowns; outputs an incorrect answer).\n*   **Sample ID 5:** solution_generation (fails to provide just the total number of touchdown passes in its answer.)\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and instructions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**SYSTEM:** AI System for Question Answering\n\n**VERSION:** (Assuming this is version 1.0 as it's the first assessment) v1.0\n\n**DATE:** October 26, 2023\n\n### PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:\n\n*   **Accuracy:** 0.60 (6/10)\n*   **Error Samples:** 4/10\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe sample execution outputs reveal some of the issues highlighted in the error analysis:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (Incorrect):** The output includes unnecessary phrasing and repeats information from the passage. It confirms the \"Dan Carpenter scored more field goals than Matt Prater\" fact, but the system should just output \"Correct.\" The system is answering a verification question, not doing question answering.\n*   **Sample ID 1 (Incorrect):** The sample output should just contain a numerical answer, but it responds with, \"The answer is correct.\" It is improperly answering a question that requires a numerical answer.\n*   **Sample ID 3 (Correct):** The system answers the questions correctly, which showcases that it is sometimes able to successfully answer questions.\n\nThe execution outputs reinforce the patterns of verbose output, failure to provide purely numerical answers when expected, and inconsistent performance.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a foundational ability to extract and process information from text. However, its performance is significantly hampered by issues in counting, aggregation, and generating concise, appropriately formatted answers. The system shows some reasoning ability but often struggles with tasks that require accurate quantification or a specific output format. The system seems to be confused on how to answer solution verification question.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Capable of identifying key entities (players, scores, etc.) from the input text.\n*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Can perform simple calculations when required.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Capable of answering \"solution verification\" questions.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Counting and Aggregation:** Frequently miscounts or incorrectly aggregates numerical information.\n*   **Concise Answer Generation:** Fails to produce concise, direct answers, often including extraneous information.\n*   **Numerical Answer Generation:** The system does not reliably output numerical answers when they are expected.\n*   **Confusion:** The system appears to be confused when it should output a \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" answer. It seems to think it needs to provide context, which is unnecessary.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Counting and Aggregation Accuracy**.  Improving the accuracy of counting and aggregation should be the primary focus, as it directly impacts the correctness of numerical answers and is a frequent source of errors.  The secondary focus should be \"Concise Answer Generation\"\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Counting Logic (High Priority):**\n    *   **Action:**  Develop code modules that parse the extracted information and use loops/conditional statements to *explicitly* count instances of touchdowns, field goals, etc.  Avoid relying on the language model alone for counting.\n    *   **Rationale:**  Provides a more reliable and auditable counting mechanism.\n    *   **Example:**  Instead of prompting the model to \"count the touchdowns,\" extract all sentences mentioning touchdowns, and then iterate through them, incrementing a counter for each.\n\n2.  **Post-Processing for Answer Formatting (High Priority):**\n    *   **Action:** Add a post-processing function that strips the generated answer down to the *exact* expected format.\n        *   For numerical answers, extract only the numerical value using regular expressions.\n        *   For verification questions, ensure the output is strictly \"Correct\" or \"Incorrect\".\n    *   **Rationale:** Ensures adherence to the expected output format and eliminates verbose responses.\n    *   **Example:**  If the expected answer is \"5\", the post-processing function should strip any output to *only* contain \"5\".\n\n3.  **Prompt Engineering for Conciseness (Medium Priority):**\n    *   **Action:** Refine prompts to strongly emphasize conciseness.  Use phrases like \"Answer with the number only,\" or \"Provide only 'Correct' or 'Incorrect' as your answer. No explanation needed.\"\n    *   **Rationale:**  Reinforces the expectation of concise output.\n\n4.  **Add Intermediate Print Statements (High Priority):**\n    *   **Action:** Insert `print` statements to output intermediate values. For example, print the raw extracted text, the result of your explicit counting logic, and your final answer. This will help you debug your AI system.\n    *   **Rationale:** Allows for better understanding for where the failures are occurring.\n\n5.  **Separate Answer Verification Questions (High Priority):**\n    *   **Action:** If possible, create a separate AI system that specializes in \"solution verification\" questions. Otherwise, ensure the prompt explicitly states to answer the question with either \"Correct\" or \"Incorrect\".\n    *   **Rationale:** Allows for better understanding for where the failures are occurring.\n\n### CAPABILITY MAPPING UPDATES (After Implementing Changes)\n\nAfter implementing the above recommendations, re-evaluate the capability mapping:\n\n*   **solution_verification:** Assess if explicit prompts and post-processing improve conciseness.\n*   **solution_generation:** Evaluate whether explicit counting and number extraction improve the accuracy and format of numerical answers.\n*   **information_extraction:** Monitor if these changes indirectly affect information extraction accuracy.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the initial assessment, the system's capabilities are currently **stable** but with significant room for improvement. Implementing the actionable recommendations should lead to an **improving** trend in the next iteration. Continuous monitoring and refinement of prompts, counting logic, and post-processing will be crucial for sustained progress.\n",

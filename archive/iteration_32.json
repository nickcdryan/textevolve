  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by first analyzing local patterns using an LLM with a system instruction to act as a pattern recognition expert. The identified patterns are then used by another LLM, instructed to apply transformation rules, to transform a test input grid based on the local patterns. The problem is decomposed into local pattern analysis and transformation application, with `analyze_local_patterns` identifying patterns and `apply_transformation` generating the transformed grid. The `call_llm` function is used to interface with the Gemini model, using the system instruction when provided, and `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process.",

However, the 'explanation' fields indicate discrepancies between the system's output and the golden answer, suggesting logical or reasoning errors rather than technical ones.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system demonstrates an ability to recognize and apply patterns from the training examples to the test input. This is evident from the successful cases, where the system correctly identified the transformation rule.\n2.  **Grid Structure Preservation:** The system correctly maintains the grid structure in its output, generating a grid with the appropriate dimensions and element types.\n3.  **Data Type Handling:** The system correctly handles numerical data within the grid structures.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Pattern Application:**  While the system can recognize a pattern, it sometimes applies it incorrectly or incompletely, leading to discrepancies between the system's output and the expected golden answer.\n2.  **Complex Pattern Understanding:** The system struggles with more intricate patterns that involve multiple transformations or dependencies between different parts of the grid. The error cases suggest difficulty in understanding the exact transformation needed for the '2' values, based on the neighboring cells containing '5' values.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Precise Pattern Application:** The system struggles with accurately applying the identified pattern to the entire grid. It shows a tendency to generalize patterns without carefully considering the specific context within the grid.\n2.  **Limited Reasoning Depth:** The AI lacks the depth of reasoning needed to accurately deduce the complex transformations present in the training examples.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Misinterpretation of Transformation Rules:**  A common error pattern is misinterpreting the relationship between elements in the input grid and their corresponding transformations in the output grid. For example, it fails to correctly place '2's in the output grid of sample 0, based on the patterns observed in the training examples. The same pattern repeats in sample 2.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **inability to accurately and completely apply learned transformation rules to new input grids**, leading to deviations from the golden answer. The system appears to over-generalize or incompletely understand the precise transformations required.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Enhance Pattern Application Logic:** The system needs a more robust mechanism for applying learned patterns to ensure accurate transformations across the entire grid.\n2.  **Improve Contextual Understanding:** The system needs to better understand the context of each cell within the grid and how its transformation depends on neighboring cells or other relevant factors. This can be achieved by incorporating logic to analyze neighbor cell values or to account for relative positions within the grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a more granular pattern matching and application algorithm.** Instead of applying a global transformation, the algorithm should identify specific patterns and apply them locally to relevant parts of the grid.\n2.  **Introduce a \"reasoning\" step that explicates the patterns it has inferred.** Add an intermediate output to show the rules it is inferring from the training data.  For example, \"if a '5' is surrounded by other '5's, change the cell to a '2'\". This will allow for easier debugging of incorrect inferences.\n3.  **Increase the diversity of training examples.** Providing more examples with varying grid sizes and transformation rules can help the system learn more robust and generalizable patterns.\n4.  **Implement a verification step that compares the generated output with the input grid and the training examples to identify and correct any inconsistencies.**\n5.  **Implement explicit error checking and recovery:** If a transformation rule cannot be confidently applied to a specific cell, the system should flag it for further analysis or attempt an alternative transformation.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample 0:**\n\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed - Incorrectly applying the learned pattern related to the transformation of certain cells to '2'.\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed - Generating an incorrect output grid due to errors in pattern application.\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed - Not verifying the output against the training examples and constraints to ensure correctness.\n\n**Sample 2:**\n\n*   constraint\\_handling: Failed - Similar to sample 0, incorrectly applying the pattern to generate '2's.\n*   solution\\_generation: Failed - Generation of incorrect values in the array.\n*   solution\\_verification: Failed - Not verifying the output against the training examples and constraints to ensure correctness.\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT: AI System Performance Assessment\n\nHere's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and requested format.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The AI attempted to generate a grid with '2's based on the surrounding '5's, but the placement and extent of the '2's are inaccurate compared to expected outputs from similar training examples. The system seems to understand the relationship but fails to apply it precisely.\n*   **Sample 1:** The AI returned \"[[1]]\". This is an unexpected and likely incorrect output, as it doesn't resemble a grid structure or any pattern learned from the training examples. This could indicate a complete failure in pattern recognition or a significant error in data processing.\n*   **Sample 2:** Similar to Sample 0, the AI attempts to apply a transformation, converting '3's to '2's. While the general area of the transformation is correct, the extent of the '2's is inaccurate. The system shows some understanding of the transformation rule but fails in its precise application.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a *rudimentary* capability in pattern recognition and grid structure manipulation. However, its performance is significantly hampered by inaccurate pattern application, a lack of contextual understanding, and potentially a complete failure mode. The low accuracy (0.33) reflects these shortcomings. The system's ability to generalize learned patterns to new input grids is unreliable.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Basic):** The system can recognize simple relationships between grid elements.\n*   **Grid Structure Preservation:** Maintains the basic grid format.\n*   **Data Type Handling:** Correctly handles numerical data (integers).\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Application:** The most critical weakness is the inability to apply learned patterns precisely and completely.\n*   **Limited Reasoning Depth:** Struggles with complex patterns and dependencies.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Fails to consider the context of individual cells when applying transformations.\n*   **Failure Mode Vulnerability:** Sample 1 suggests the system can fail spectacularly, returning nonsensical outputs.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Precise Pattern Application**. This addresses the core issue of the AI's inability to accurately translate learned rules into correct output grids.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Granular Pattern Matching and Application:**\n    *   **Details:** Refactor the pattern application algorithm to operate at a more granular level. Instead of a global transformation, the algorithm should identify *specific* patterns (e.g., \"If a '5' is surrounded by at least 3 other '5's, change it to a '2'\") and apply them *locally* to the *relevant cells*. Use a sliding window approach to scan the grid.\n    *   **Justification:** This will address the over-generalization issue and allow for more nuanced transformations based on local context.\n2.  **Introduce Pattern Inference Explanation:**\n    *   **Details:** Add an intermediate step where the AI explicitly states the rules it has inferred from the training data *before* applying them to the test input. Output the inferred rules as text (e.g., \"Rule 1: If a cell is 'A' and has 'B' as a neighbor, change it to 'C'\").\n    *   **Justification:** This will provide valuable insight into the AI's reasoning process, making it easier to debug incorrect inferences. If you had this for Sample 0, you might see the system has incompletely inferred the rule for changing 5's into 2's. For sample 1, this may shed light on what rule the system is attempting to follow, and why it's outputting \"[[1]]\".\n3.  **Implement Contextual Analysis:**\n    *   **Details:** Incorporate logic to analyze the neighborhood of each cell. The transformation applied to a cell should depend on the values of its neighboring cells and their relative positions.  Consider using convolutional filters or similar techniques to capture spatial relationships.\n    *   **Justification:** This will address the lack of contextual understanding and allow the AI to make more informed decisions about transformations.\n4.  **Implement Verification Step with Backtracking (Simplified for now):**\n    *   **Details:** After generating the output, compare it to the input grid and the training examples. Look for inconsistencies (e.g., large deviations from expected patterns). If inconsistencies are detected, implement a simple backtracking mechanism. This could involve reverting the most recent transformation and trying an alternative (or flagging the area for human review).\n    *   **Justification:** This will help to catch and correct obvious errors, improving the overall accuracy.\n5.  **Increase Training Data Diversity (with focus on edge cases):**\n    *   **Details:** Expand the training dataset to include more examples with varying grid sizes, transformation rules, and *edge cases* (e.g., patterns that only apply to certain regions of the grid).\n    *   **Justification:** This will help the system learn more robust and generalizable patterns.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is currently **Stable (Low)**. While the system shows some basic capabilities, the high error rate and failure modes indicate that significant improvements are needed. Implementing the recommendations above should shift the trend towards **Improving**.\n",

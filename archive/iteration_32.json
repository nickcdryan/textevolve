  "approach_summary": "This script employs a question decomposition approach, breaking down a complex question into simpler sub-questions, then synthesizing information for each sub-question using targeted information retrieval and validating answers using a simulated knowledge graph. It involves agents with roles such as question decomposer, search engine simulator, answer extraction expert, and knowledge graph validator. The `call_llm` function interacts with the Gemini API, `decompose_question` breaks down the initial question, `retrieve_information` fetches information for each sub-question, `extract_answer` extracts the answer from the retrieved information, and `knowledge_graph_validator` validates the extracted answer. The `main` function orchestrates the entire process: it calls `decompose_question`, iterates through the decomposed questions calling `retrieve_information`, `extract_answer`, and `knowledge_graph_validator` for each, and then synthesizes the final answer.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError in the provided error cases. However, \"INVALID\" validation results indicate logical or factual errors during the validation phase.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Decomposition of Questions:** The system effectively decomposes complex questions into smaller, more manageable sub-questions. This helps in focusing on specific aspects of the problem.\n2.  **Information Retrieval:** The system demonstrates the ability to retrieve relevant information based on the decomposed sub-questions. The \"Retrieved info\" sections show that it can fetch information related to the question.\n3.  **Validation:** The system includes a validation step, attempting to verify the extracted answers. This is a crucial step in ensuring the correctness of the final response.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Inaccurate Information Extraction/Validation:** The system sometimes extracts or validates information incorrectly. This is evidenced by the \"INVALID\" validation results and the mismatch between the system's answer and the golden answer in the error cases. In sample 0 the system retrieves correct information \"Kim Whitley played Theresa in Season 5 of Moesha.\" but marks it as INVALID.\n2.  **Synthesis of Information:** Even when individual pieces of information are correctly retrieved, the system struggles to synthesize them into a coherent and correct answer. The final answer often contains multiple disparate pieces of information instead of a single, concise answer.\n3.  **Handling of Conflicting Information:** The system retrieves and presents conflicting information (e.g., multiple actors playing the same role), failing to reconcile these discrepancies.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Validation Logic:** The validation logic is unreliable, frequently misclassifying correct extractions as invalid. It seems to have problems with negative constraints (e.g. \"No, Theresa was not a character in Season 5 of Moesha.\") This issue undermines the entire reasoning process, as it prevents the system from accurately assessing the validity of retrieved information.\n2.  **Answer Synthesis:** The system lacks a robust mechanism for synthesizing the extracted information into a final, accurate answer. It outputs multiple pieces of information rather than converging on a single, well-supported conclusion.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Incorrect Validation:** The system incorrectly validates information, leading to the inclusion of irrelevant or incorrect details in the final answer. This often results in answers that are a collection of semi-related facts rather than a direct response to the question.\n2.  **Difficulty with Specifics:** The system struggles with questions that require very specific information (e.g., a particular actor in a particular season). The general information retrieval is often correct, but pinpointing the exact detail proves challenging.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **unreliable validation logic**, which frequently mislabels correct information as invalid and vice versa. This causes the system to discard relevant information and accept incorrect facts, ultimately leading to inaccurate and incoherent answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Validation Accuracy:** The accuracy of the validation process needs significant improvement. This requires refining the criteria used for validation and improving the system's ability to handle negative constraints and nuanced information.\n2.  **Answer Synthesis:** The system needs a better mechanism for synthesizing extracted information into a concise, accurate answer. This could involve using techniques like weighted scoring, conflict resolution, or a more sophisticated natural language generation model.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Refine Validation Rules:** Revise the validation rules to be more precise and context-aware. Consider using more sophisticated natural language understanding techniques to better interpret the meaning of retrieved information and determine its validity in relation to the question. Add logging and print statements showing the thought process and input to the validation function, to help debug the error.\n2.  **Implement Conflict Resolution:** Develop a mechanism for resolving conflicting information. This could involve prioritizing information from more reliable sources, using logical reasoning to identify inconsistencies, or employing a probabilistic approach to weigh different pieces of evidence.\n3.  **Improve Answer Synthesis:** Use a more sophisticated language generation model to synthesize the extracted information into a coherent and accurate answer. This model should be able to identify the most relevant information and present it in a clear and concise manner.\n4.  **Implement Source Tracking:** Track the source of each piece of information extracted. This would allow the system to prioritize information from more reliable sources and to provide citations for its claims.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n**Sample 0:**\n*   information_extraction: Partially failed (retrieved correct info about Kim Whitley but validated it incorrectly).\n*   solution_verification: Failed (incorrectly validated the information).\n*   decision_making: Failed (included incorrect and irrelevant information in the final answer).\n**Sample 1:**\n*   information_extraction: Partially failed (retrieved Dr. Paul F. Hoffman instead of Donald M. Gray).\n*   solution_verification: Failed (incorrectly validated the information).\n*   decision_making: Failed (included incorrect and irrelevant information in the final answer).\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a significant issue with the \"Validation result\" step.  Specifically:\n\n*   **Inconsistent Validation:** The system often marks correct answers as INVALID and sometimes incorrect answers as VALID. This inconsistent behavior is a major source of errors.  For example, in Sample 0, the system correctly extracts \"Kim Whitley played Theresa in Season 5 of Moesha\" but validates it as INVALID. Conversely, in Sample 2, the system retrieves \"Yes\" regarding Antigone being performed, marks it as INVALID and outputs the wrong final answer.\n*   **Answer Synthesis Problems:** Even when the system retrieves relevant information and validates it correctly, it often fails to synthesize this information into a coherent and concise final answer. The final output is often a list of facts, rather than a single, well-formed response. This indicates a weakness in natural language generation and answer assembly. It seems to simply concatenate extracted answers.\n*   **Repetition and Redundancy:**  The system sometimes includes redundant information in the final answer.  This suggests that the system isn't effectively filtering or prioritizing the extracted information.\n*   **Information Retrieval Errors:** The system occasionally retrieves incorrect information from the external knowledge source.\n*   **Decomposition Effectiveness:**  While the system decomposes the questions effectively, there's little evidence that the answers to the sub-questions are used to generate a synthesized final answer. The sub-questions appear to be addressed independently.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates the ability to decompose complex questions, retrieve relevant information, and attempt to validate extracted answers. However, its overall capability is severely limited by unreliable validation logic and poor answer synthesis. The accuracy score of 0.33 reflects these limitations. The system is good at finding related information, but struggles at determining truthfulness and answering accurately.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Question Decomposition:** The system effectively breaks down complex questions into smaller, more manageable sub-questions. This is a crucial first step in answering complex queries.\n*   **Information Retrieval:** The system can retrieve information relevant to the decomposed sub-questions. While not always accurate, the retrieval mechanism appears to be functional.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Unreliable Validation Logic:** This is the most critical weakness. The validation process is inaccurate and inconsistent, leading to the rejection of correct information and the acceptance of incorrect facts.\n*   **Poor Answer Synthesis:** The system struggles to synthesize the extracted information into a coherent and accurate answer. The final output is often a disjointed collection of facts.\n*   **Information Extraction Errors:** While less frequent than validation errors, the system occasionally extracts incorrect information from the retrieved documents.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Validation Accuracy**.  Improving the reliability of the validation logic will have the most significant impact on the system's overall performance. If the validation is untrustworthy, the whole system suffers and leads to incoherent responses.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Debug and Refine Validation Rules:**\n    *   **Logging and Instrumentation:** Add extensive logging to the validation function. Log the input to the function (extracted answer, retrieved info, question context), the validation rules being applied, and the reasoning behind the validation decision. Use print statements in the validation function to understand its inputs and outputs.\n    *   **Rule Review:** Review the validation rules themselves. Are they too strict? Too lenient? Do they handle negative constraints correctly (e.g., \"No, Theresa was not...\")?\n    *   **Edge Case Testing:** Create a suite of test cases that specifically target edge cases and known failure modes in the validation logic. Ensure the validation is robust across various question types and information formats.\n    *   **Consider Confidence Scores:** Instead of a strict VALID/INVALID, consider assigning confidence scores to the validation results. This allows the system to weigh different pieces of evidence and make more informed decisions.\n2.  **Implement a Confidence-Based Answer Selection Mechanism:**\n    *   **Score Extracted Answers:** Assign scores to extracted answers based on the validation confidence, source reliability (if available), and relevance to the original question.\n    *   **Thresholding:** Use a threshold to filter out answers with low confidence scores.\n    *   **Prioritize Direct Answers:** Prioritize extracted answers that directly answer the original question over those that answer sub-questions.\n3.  **Enhance Information Retrieval Accuracy:**\n    *   **Query Refinement:** Experiment with different query formulations to improve the precision and recall of the information retrieval process.\n    *   **Rank Retrieved Documents:** Implement a mechanism to rank the retrieved documents based on their relevance to the question.\n4.  **Improve Answer Synthesis using a Language Model:**\n    *   **Use a summarization model:** Instead of simply concatenating the answers, use a summarization model to condense the answers from the subquestions into a single coherent answer.\n    *   **Use a question answering model:** Feed the outputs of the information extraction step, along with the original question, into a question answering model to generate the final answer.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the limited data, the capability trend is **Stable, with a significant need for improvement**. The system demonstrates basic capabilities in question decomposition and information retrieval, but the unreliable validation logic and poor answer synthesis prevent it from achieving satisfactory accuracy. Addressing the validation logic is critical for seeing a positive trend.\n",

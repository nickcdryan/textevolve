The site is located on the coast road between Cromer and Mundesley, 1\u00a0kilometre east of the village of Trimingham. The radar station is a satellite station of RAF Neatishead (grid reference [ TG289382] ). This radar station is controlled and maintained by a section of Radar Technicians and Operators and supported by a team of Ground Engineers.

Between 1953 and 1958, the D.A.T. built a radar station in an old troops shelter (in French : \"abri-caverne\") near the fort, called \"Ouvrage \"G\"\". Called \"\"Station Ma\u00eetre Radar 60/921\"\", it was used beginning in 1959, covering an area on the surface of three times the area of the troops shelter. Ouvrage \"G\" complemented \"Ouvrage F\", another D.A.T. station located at the old Fort Fran\u00e7ois de Guise at Metz, while \"Ouvrage H\" was established as \"Base a\u00e9rienne\" 901 Drachenbronn/\"Station Ma\u00eetre Radar 50/921\" in the former Maginot Ouvrage Hochwald.

To guard against potential invasions, the U.S. Army built \"farm\" buildings; the cinderblock structures, complete with shingled roofs, and fake windows and dormers, housed an early-warning radar station. From the air, the sea, and even the road, these buildings appeared to be part of a working farm. In fact, they housed a diesel generator, electronic equipment, and two 50-caliber anti-aircraft guns. This is one of 65 that were built all along the western coast of America during World War II.

A more lasting peace was concluded at Paris on 4 December 1259 amidst the threat of a second Baron's war in England. Initially, Henry refused to give up the rights the territory of his ancestors in France, however, Louis restored Guyenne to Henry, thinking that this noble gesture would assure him an extended time of peace with England because he was mostly concerned with going on the Seventh Crusade in 1248 and wanted to rally support for the cause within his own realm. By signing the treaty, Louis and Henry put an end to the century-old conflict between Capetians and Plantagenets concerning the lands inherited by Henry II of England conquered by Philip Augustus of France. By this text, Henry III renounces his claims concerning Normandy, Anjou, Touraine, Maine, and Poitou and Louis IX gave him the necessary sum to maintain 500 knights for two years and the revenues of the Agenais and his domains in the dioceses of Limoges, Cahors, and P\u00e9rigueux. On February 10 1259, the treaty is first ratified by Richard of Cornwall. On February 17, it was ratified in Westminster by prosecutors in the name of the king, and, by December 4, Simon V de Montfort and Eleanor of England also ratified the treaty. Finally, Henry arrived in France on December 4 1259 to pay homage to Louis, thus symbolically ending the rivalry. Afterwards, an unexpected and lively friendship arised between the two kings to the point that, sometime later, Louis offered Henry an elephant which had been given to him by the Sultan of Egypt and ratified a papal bull, as the feudal overlord of Henry, that annulled the Provisions of Oxford and declared himself as a firm supporter of the Royal prerogative in England.\n\nQUESTION: Which areas did Louis IX give to Henry III?\n        Sub-questions: 1.

On the Broncos' first offensive possession, running back Ronnie Hillman committed a fumble deep in their own territory, and the Steelers capitalized two plays later, with a 2-yard touchdown run by running back DeAngelo Williams. The Broncos reeled off 20 unanswered points, with quarterback Brock Osweiler throwing a pair of touchdown passes - an 18-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and a 61-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, followed in the second quarter by Osweiler scrambling for a 7-yard touchdown. The latter score came after the Broncos' defense intercepted Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, and also had a missed extra-point attempt by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Steelers then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Chris Boswell. The Broncos then increased their lead to 27-10, with Osweiler connecting with Thomas on a 6-yard touchdown pass at the 2-minute warning. However, it would be the Broncos' final scoring play of the game, as the offense was shut out in the second half for the third consecutive week. The Steelers pulled to within 27-13, with Boswell kicking a 41-yard field goal just before halftime. Midway through the third quarter, Roethlisberger connected with wide receiver Antonio Brown on a 9-yard touchdown. Later in the third quarter, Broncos' return specialist Jordan Norwood returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown; however, the touchdown was nullified by an illegal substitution penalty. Following a Broncos' three-and-out, the Steelers tied the game early in the fourth quarter, with Roethlisberger throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Markus Wheaton. Each team proceeded to trade punt on their next two possessions, and with just over five minutes remaining, Osweiler was intercepted by Steelers' linebacker Ryan Shazier at the Broncos' 37-yard line, and three plays later, the Steelers re-claimed the lead, with a 23-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. The Broncos then marched down to the Steelers' 36-yard line with 2:17 remaining, but turned the football over on downs. Just before the two-minute warning, the Steelers were attempting to run out the clock, however, Roethlisberger chose to pass the football, and was intercepted by linebacker Brandon Marshall just before the two-minute warning, giving the Broncos one last possession. However, Osweiler threw four straight incompletions, and the Steelers ran out the clock.\n\nQUESTION: Who scored more points, the Steelers or the Broncos?"}

The Broncos reeled off 20 unanswered points, with quarterback Brock Osweiler throwing a pair of touchdown passes - an 18-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and a 61-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, followed in the second quarter by Osweiler scrambling for a 7-yard touchdown. The latter score came after the Broncos' defense intercepted Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, and also had a missed extra-point attempt by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Steelers then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Chris Boswell. The Broncos then increased their lead to 27-10, with Osweiler connecting with Thomas on a 6-yard touchdown pass at the 2-minute warning. However, it would be the Broncos' final scoring play of the game, as the offense was shut out in the second half for the third consecutive week. The Steelers pulled to within 27-13, with Boswell kicking a 41-yard field goal just before halftime. Midway through the third quarter, Roethlisberger connected with wide receiver Antonio Brown on a 9-yard touchdown. Later in the third quarter, Broncos' return specialist Jordan Norwood returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown; however, the touchdown was nullified by an illegal substitution penalty. Following a Broncos' three-and-out, the Steelers tied the game early in the fourth quarter, with Roethlisberger throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Markus Wheaton. Each team proceeded to trade punt on their next two possessions, and with just over five minutes remaining, Osweiler was intercepted by Steelers' linebacker Ryan Shazier at the Broncos' 37-yard line, and three plays later, the Steelers re-claimed the lead, with a 23-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. The Broncos then marched down to the Steelers' 36-yard line with 2:17 remaining, but turned the football over on downs. Just before the two-minute warning, the Steelers were attempting to run out the clock, however, Roethlisberger chose to pass the football, and was intercepted by linebacker Brandon Marshall just before the two-minute warning, giving the Broncos one last possession. However, Osweiler threw four straight incompletions, and the Steelers ran out the clock.\n\nQUESTION: Who scored more points, the Steelers or the Broncos?\n        Sub-questions:\n        ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert question decomposer."}, "output": "1.

After the death of King William II of Sicily his cousin Tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in 1190 as King Tancred of Sicily, although the legal heir was William's aunt Constance, wife of the new Emperor Henry VI. Tancred had imprisoned William's widow, Queen Joan, who was Richard's sister and did not give her the money she had inherited in William's will. When Richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance; she was freed on 28 September, but without the inheritance. The presence of foreign troops also caused unrest: in October, the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave. Richard attacked Messina, capturing it on 4 October 1190. After looting and burning the city Richard established his base there, but this created tension between Richard and Philip Augustus. He remained there until Tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on 4 March 1191. The treaty was signed by Richard, Philip, and Tancred. Its main terms were:\n\nQUESTION: King Tancred of Sicily seized power from who?\n        Synthesized Answer: King Tancred of Sicily seized power from William's aunt Constance, who was the legal heir.\n\n\n        Example:\n        Original Question: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?\n        Synthesized Answer: Chris Johnson's first touchdown was 28 yards, and Jason Hanson didn't have a field goal, so a combined value can't be computed.\n        Validation: Valid - The synthesized answer accurately reflects the information available.\n\n        Is the answer correct and complete?

The passage implies this, but the answer could be more direct. A more accurate answer would be: King Tancred of Sicily seized power after the death of King William II, preventing the legal heir, William's aunt Constance, from taking the throne.\n", "status": "success"}

If the side length is increased by 50%, the new area is 225.\n\n        Question: Suppose that a $30$-digit integer $N$ is composed of thirteen $7$s and seventeen $3$s. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $36$?\n        Sub-problems: 1. **Understand Divisibility Rules:** Recall the divisibility rules for 4 and 9, since 36 = 4 * 9 and gcd(4, 9) = 1. A number is divisible by 36 if and only if it is divisible by both 4 and 9.  Therefore, we need to find the remainders when $N$ is divided by 4 and 9.\n\n2. **Remainder when dividing by 4:** The remainder when $N$ is divided by 4 depends only on the last two digits of $N$.  Since we don't know the exact order of the digits, we must consider all possible combinations of the last two digits. However, since we are looking for the remainder, we can consider the possible values of the last two digits and their remainders modulo 4.\n\n3. **Possible last two digits:** The last two digits can be 33, 37, 73, or 77.\n    *   33 mod 4 = 1\n    *   37 mod 4 = 1\n    *   73 mod 4 = 1\n    *   77 mod 4 = 1\n    Therefore, N mod 4 = 1.\n\n4. **Remainder when dividing by 9:** The remainder when $N$ is divided by 9 is the same as the remainder when the sum of its digits is divided by 9.\n\n5. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**  The sum of the digits of $N$ is $(13 \\times 7) + (17 \\times 3) = 91 + 51 = 142$.\n\n6. **Find the remainder of the sum when divided by 9:** 142 mod 9 = (142 - 90 - 45) mod 9 = (7) mod 9 = 7. Therefore, N mod 9 = 7.\n\n7. **Solve the system of congruences:** We need to find a number $x$ such that $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ and $x \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$.\n\n8. **Solve for x:** We can write $x = 4k + 1$ for some integer $k$.  Substituting this into the second congruence, we get $4k + 1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{9}$, which simplifies to $4k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$.\nMultiplying by 7 (the inverse of 4 modulo 9) we get $28k \\equiv 42 \\pmod{9}$.  This simplifies to $k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{9}$. So, $k = 9j + 6$ for some integer $j$.\nSubstituting this back into $x = 4k + 1$, we get $x = 4(9j + 6) + 1 = 36j + 24 + 1 = 36j + 25$.\n\n9. **Final Answer:**  Therefore, $x \\equiv 25 \\pmod{36}$.\n\n        Solutions: 1. State the divisibility rule for 36.\n2. Express the remainder when N is divided by 4 in terms of the last two digits.\n3. List all possible combinations of the last two digits of N.\n4. Compute the remainder when each possible combination of the last two digits is divided by 4.\n5. Determine N mod 4.\n6. State the divisibility rule for 9.\n7. Calculate the sum of the digits of N.\n8. Calculate the remainder when the sum of the digits is divided by 9.\n9. Determine N mod 9.\n10. Write the system of congruences to solve.\n11. Express x in terms of k using the first congruence.\n12. Substitute the expression for x into the second congruence.\n13. Simplify the congruence.\n14. Find the modular inverse of 4 modulo 9.\n15. Multiply both sides of the congruence by the modular inverse.\n16. Simplify the congruence.\n17. Express k in terms of j.\n18. Substitute the expression for k back into the expression for x.\n19. Simplify the expression for x.\n20. Determine N mod 36.\n\nSolutions:\n1. A number is divisible by 36 if and only if it is divisible by both 4 and 9.\n2. The remainder when N is divided by 4 depends only on the last two digits of N.\n3. 33, 37, 73, 77\n4. 33 mod 4 = 1; 37 mod 4 = 1; 73 mod 4 = 1; 77 mod 4 = 1\n5. N mod 4 = 1\n6. The remainder when N is divided by 9 is the same as the remainder when the sum of its digits is divided by 9.\n7. (13 * 7) + (17 * 3) = 91 + 51 = 142\n8. 142 mod 9 = 7\n9.

The coefficient of $x^3$ should be positive, and the coefficients should have no common factor other than 1.\n        Sub-problems: Here's a decomposition of the problem of finding the cubic polynomial with integer coefficients that has $\\cos 20^\\circ$ as a root, with the conditions specified:\n\n1. **Recognize the connection between cosine and multiple angles:** Recall trigonometric identities relating $\\cos(n\\theta)$ to powers of $\\cos(\\theta)$. In particular, the triple angle formula for cosine will be relevant.\n\n2. **Apply the triple angle formula:** Use the identity $\\cos(3\\theta) = 4\\cos^3(\\theta) - 3\\cos(\\theta)$.\n\n3. **Substitute $\\theta = 20^\\circ$:** Substitute $20^\\circ$ for $\\theta$ in the triple angle formula to obtain an equation involving $\\cos(20^\\circ)$.\n\n4. **Evaluate $\\cos(60^\\circ)$:** Determine the value of $\\cos(60^\\circ)$.\n\n5. **Form an equation:**  Use the value of $\\cos(60^\\circ)$ to rewrite the equation from step 3. This equation will have $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ and constants.\n\n6. **Substitute $x = \\cos(20^\\circ)$:** Replace $\\cos(20^\\circ)$ with $x$ in the equation from step 5.  This will give you a polynomial equation in terms of $x$.\n\n7. **Manipulate the equation into polynomial form:** Rearrange the equation to get a polynomial equation in the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$, where $a, b, c, d$ are integers.\n\n8. **Ensure $a > 0$:** If the coefficient of $x^3$ is negative, multiply the entire equation by $-1$ to make it positive.\n\n9. **Simplify the coefficients:** Divide all the coefficients by their greatest common divisor (GCD) to ensure that the coefficients have no common factor other than 1.\n\n10. **State the polynomial:** The polynomial you've obtained in step 9 is the desired cubic polynomial.\n\n        Solutions: 1.  N/A\n2.  $\\cos(3\\theta) = 4\\cos^3(\\theta) - 3\\cos(\\theta)$\n3.  $\\cos(3 \\cdot 20^\\circ) = 4\\cos^3(20^\\circ) - 3\\cos(20^\\circ)$\n4.  $\\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n5.  $\\frac{1}{2} = 4\\cos^3(20^\\circ) - 3\\cos(20^\\circ)$\n6.  $\\frac{1}{2} = 4x^3 - 3x$\n7.  $4x^3 - 3x = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies 8x^3 - 6x = 1 \\implies 8x^3 - 6x - 1 = 0$\n8.  Since the coefficient of $x^3$ is already positive, no change is needed.\n9.

What is the area of triangle $ABC$?\n        Sub-problems: 1.  Recognize that in an isosceles right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse bisects the hypotenuse.\n2.  Determine the length of $\\overline{BD}$ since $\\overline{AD}$ is an altitude.\n3.  Calculate the length of the hypotenuse $\\overline{BC}$.\n4.  Recognize the relationship between the hypotenuse and the legs of an isosceles right triangle (e.g., $c = a\\sqrt{2}$).\n5.  Calculate the length of the legs of the triangle.\n6.  Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\n\n        Solutions: 1. Okay, I understand that in an isosceles right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse bisects the hypotenuse.\n2. Since $\\overline{AD}$ is the altitude to the hypotenuse and $AD = 6$, then $BD = AD = 6$.\n3. The length of the hypotenuse $\\overline{BC}$ is $BD + DC = 6 + 6 = 12$.\n4. The relationship between the hypotenuse $c$ and the legs $a$ of an isosceles right triangle is $c = a\\sqrt{2}$.\n5. Since $c = 12$, then $12 = a\\sqrt{2}$, so $a = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{12\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the length of the legs is $6\\sqrt{2}$.\n6.

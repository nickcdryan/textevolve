The Steelers then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Chris Boswell. The Broncos then increased their lead to 27-10, with Osweiler connecting with Thomas on a 6-yard touchdown pass at the 2-minute warning. However, it would be the Broncos' final scoring play of the game, as the offense was shut out in the second half for the third consecutive week. The Steelers pulled to within 27-13, with Boswell kicking a 41-yard field goal just before halftime. Midway through the third quarter, Roethlisberger connected with wide receiver Antonio Brown on a 9-yard touchdown. Later in the third quarter, Broncos' return specialist Jordan Norwood returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown; however, the touchdown was nullified by an illegal substitution penalty. Following a Broncos' three-and-out, the Steelers tied the game early in the fourth quarter, with Roethlisberger throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Markus Wheaton. Each team proceeded to trade punt on their next two possessions, and with just over five minutes remaining, Osweiler was intercepted by Steelers' linebacker Ryan Shazier at the Broncos' 37-yard line, and three plays later, the Steelers re-claimed the lead, with a 23-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. The Broncos then marched down to the Steelers' 36-yard line with 2:17 remaining, but turned the football over on downs. Just before the two-minute warning, the Steelers were attempting to run out the clock, however, Roethlisberger chose to pass the football, and was intercepted by linebacker Brandon Marshall just before the two-minute warning, giving the Broncos one last possession. However, Osweiler threw four straight incompletions, and the Steelers ran out the clock.\n\nQUESTION: Who scored more points, the Steelers or the Broncos? Answer: The Steelers\n Passage: - On the Broncos' first offensive possession, running back Ronnie Hillman committed a fumble deep in their own territory, and the Steelers capitalized two plays later, with a 2-yard touchdown run by running back DeAngelo Williams.\n- The Broncos reeled off 20 unanswered points, with quarterback Brock Osweiler throwing a pair of touchdown passes - an 18-yarder to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas and a 61-yarder to wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders, followed in the second quarter by Osweiler scrambling for a 7-yard touchdown.\n- The latter score came after the Broncos' defense intercepted Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, and also had a missed extra-point attempt by placekicker Brandon McManus.\n- The Steelers then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Chris Boswell.\n- The Broncos then increased their lead to 27-10, with Osweiler connecting with Thomas on a 6-yard touchdown pass at the 2-minute warning.\n- However, it would be the Broncos' final scoring play of the game, as the offense was shut out in the second half for the third consecutive week.\n- The Steelers pulled to within 27-13, with Boswell kicking a 41-yard field goal just before halftime.\n- Midway through the third quarter, Roethlisberger connected with wide receiver Antonio Brown on a 9-yard touchdown.\n- Following a Broncos' three-and-out, the Steelers tied the game early in the fourth quarter, with Roethlisberger throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Markus Wheaton.\n- and three plays later, the Steelers re-claimed the lead, with a 23-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Brown.\n Verification:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert answer verifier."}, "output": "Begin by calculating the points scored by each team.\n\nBroncos:\n- Demaryius Thomas touchdown: 6 points\n- Emmanuel Sanders touchdown: 6 points\n- Brock Osweiler touchdown: 6 points\n- Demaryius Thomas touchdown: 6 points\nTotal Touchdown points = 24\n- Extra point (one missed): 3 points\n\nTotal points for Broncos = 27\n\nSteelers:\n- DeAngelo Williams touchdown: 6 points\n- Chris Boswell field goal: 3 points\n- Chris Boswell field goal: 3 points\n- Antonio Brown touchdown: 6 points\n- Markus Wheaton touchdown: 6 points\n- Antonio Brown touchdown: 6 points\nTotal touchdown points = 27\nTotal field goal points = 6\nTotal extra points: 4 * 1 = 4 points\n\nTotal points for Steelers = 37\n\nTherefore, the Steelers scored more points than the Broncos.\n", "status": "success"}

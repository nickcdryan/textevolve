  "approach_summary": "This script answers questions using LLMs by decomposing the problem into entity/relationship extraction, search query generation, information retrieval, answer generation, and answer validation. Each step leverages the Gemini LLM with a specific system instruction to act as a specialized agent (e.g., information extractor, query generator). The script uses a few functions: `call_llm` for interacting with the Gemini model, `extract_entities_and_relationships` to identify key information, `generate_search_query` to create a search query, `retrieve_information` to simulate a search engine, `generate_answer` to formulate an answer, and `validate_answer` to check the answer's correctness. The overall workflow involves sequentially calling these functions, passing the output of one as input to the next, ultimately returning the validated answer or an error message.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors were explicitly present in the provided 'output' fields for any of the error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nBased on the limited data (only error cases), it's difficult to definitively assess strengths. However, the following can be tentatively identified:\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval (Potential):** The system attempts to retrieve relevant information based on the questions, which is a fundamental requirement for question answering. This is evident in all error cases where the system generates an answer, even if incorrect.\n2.  **Attempt at Logical Reasoning (Potential):** In error case 1, the system includes the correct answer \"University of Chile,\" suggesting an attempt at extracting relevant information. Similarly, in error case 2, it provides a year, even though incorrect.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** The system struggles to extract precise and accurate information from the knowledge source, leading to incorrect or incomplete answers. This is demonstrated in error cases 1 and 2 where the retrieved information is inaccurate.\n2.  **Failure to Verify Information and Handle Conflicting Information:** In error case 1, the system includes both the correct and an incorrect university, indicating a failure to verify the information and resolve conflicting options. The presence of both 'University of Chile' and 'American University' suggests a lack of validation before presenting a final answer.\n3. **Incorrect Premise Detection:** The system, in error case 1, falsely assumes the premise of the question is incorrect. This indicates a problem with understanding complex relationships and potentially a reliance on superficial patterns.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction and Verification:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to reliably extract accurate information and verify its correctness. This impacts both the generation of correct answers and the detection of invalid premises.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Inclusion of Incorrect Information:** A recurring pattern is the inclusion of incorrect information alongside potentially correct information (as seen in error case 1). This suggests a problem in discriminating between relevant and irrelevant or inaccurate data.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Question's Premise:** One instance exists where the system declares the question's premise incorrect. While this is acceptable in some cases if done correctly, it indicates a failure to fully understand the implicit assumptions within the query (as seen in error case 2).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inaccurate and unreliable information extraction process, coupled with insufficient validation and error detection**. The system needs to be significantly improved in its ability to pinpoint the specific information required to answer the question correctly and verify that the retrieved information is accurate and relevant.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Implement more robust information extraction techniques that are less prone to retrieving irrelevant or inaccurate data. This might involve using more sophisticated pattern matching algorithms, incorporating semantic understanding, or utilizing external knowledge bases for verification.\n2.  **Information Verification:** Implement a verification mechanism that assesses the accuracy and consistency of extracted information before it is used to generate an answer. This could involve cross-referencing information from multiple sources, applying logical reasoning to check for inconsistencies, or using external validation tools.\n3.  **Question Understanding:** Improve the system's ability to understand the nuances of the question, including implicit assumptions and complex relationships. This might involve incorporating natural language understanding techniques such as semantic parsing or dependency parsing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a multi-stage information extraction process:**\n    *   **Stage 1: Focused Retrieval:** Retrieve a narrow set of potentially relevant information based on keywords and entity recognition.\n    *   **Stage 2: Semantic Filtering:** Filter the retrieved information based on semantic relevance to the question. Use techniques like sentence similarity or knowledge graph traversal to identify the most relevant pieces of information.\n    *   **Stage 3: Verification and Validation:** Verify the accuracy and consistency of the filtered information by cross-referencing with other sources, applying logical rules, or using external validation tools.\n2.  **Integrate external knowledge bases for validation:** Use external knowledge bases like Wikidata or DBpedia to validate extracted information and resolve ambiguities. For example, in error case 1, the system could consult Wikidata to verify that Ana Figueroa studied at the University of Chile and not at the American University.\n3.  **Improve question understanding through dependency parsing:** Use dependency parsing to identify the key entities and relationships in the question. This can help the system to formulate more precise queries for information retrieval and to identify implicit assumptions.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (extracted incorrect university)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify the correctness of both universities)\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly identified premise and genus)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (extracted incorrect year)\n",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:** (As provided in the prompt)\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs confirm the weaknesses identified in the error analysis.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The output includes *two* possible answers, one correct (\"University of Chile\") and one incorrect (\"American University\"). This highlights a significant failure in filtering and validation. The system extracts both pieces of information and presents them without discerning which is correct, indicating a lack of confidence scoring or contextual understanding.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system incorrectly flags the premise of the question as incorrect and provides an explanation involving related but ultimately *incorrect* genera. This points to a flawed mechanism for premise verification, possibly relying on superficial keyword matching rather than deeper semantic understanding. The system appears to recognize relevant keywords (*Turdus*, *Rubigula*) but fails to correctly apply their relationships to the question's premise.\n*   **Sample 2:** The output provides an incorrect year (\"1930\"). This again demonstrates a problem with accurate information extraction. While it is finding a *year* related to the question, it's the wrong one. This could indicate a bias towards earlier dates or a lack of proper filtering criteria.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very low accuracy and struggles with fundamental tasks like information extraction, verification, and accurate premise detection. While it exhibits some potential for information retrieval and logical reasoning, these capabilities are currently unreliable and overshadowed by significant weaknesses. The system's performance is unacceptable for any practical application requiring accurate question answering.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempts to answer questions:** The system consistently attempts to provide an answer, demonstrating a functioning end-to-end process.\n*   **Information Retrieval (Potential):** The system retrieves *related* information, indicating some ability to identify relevant data, even if inaccurate.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** The most critical weakness. The system frequently extracts incorrect or incomplete information.\n*   **Poor Information Verification:** The system lacks effective mechanisms for validating extracted information, leading to the inclusion of incorrect or conflicting details.\n*   **Faulty Premise Detection:** The system sometimes incorrectly rejects a question's premise based on flawed reasoning.\n*   **Lack of Confidence Scoring/Filtering:** The system lacks a mechanism for assessing the confidence of extracted information, leading to the inclusion of both correct and incorrect answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Information Extraction and Validation**. Without reliable information extraction, other capabilities are irrelevant.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a more robust information extraction pipeline:**\n    *   **Refine Query Formulation:** Improve the way the system formulates search queries based on the question. Focus on more specific and targeted queries rather than broad keyword searches. Use techniques like named entity recognition to identify key entities in the question and incorporate them into the query.\n    *   **Rank Retrieved Passages:** Implement a ranking mechanism to prioritize retrieved passages based on their relevance to the question. This could involve using techniques like TF-IDF or BM25 to score the passages based on keyword frequency and importance.\n    *   **Contextualize Extraction:** Implement a more sophisticated mechanism for extracting information from the ranked passages. This should take into account the context of the extracted information and its relationship to the question. Use techniques like dependency parsing or semantic role labeling to understand the relationships between words and phrases in the passage.\n2.  **Introduce a multi-stage validation process:**\n    *   **Source Credibility Check:** Evaluate the credibility of the source from which information is extracted. Prioritize information from authoritative and reliable sources.\n    *   **Consistency Check:** Check the consistency of extracted information with other known facts and information sources. Identify and resolve any inconsistencies or contradictions.\n    *   **Confidence Scoring:** Assign a confidence score to each piece of extracted information based on its source credibility, consistency, and relevance to the question.\n\n3.  **Improve premise validation:**\n    *   **Semantic Similarity Analysis:** Use semantic similarity analysis to compare the question's premise with known facts and information sources. This can help the system to identify cases where the premise is incorrect or inconsistent.\n    *   **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Integrate a knowledge graph to provide a broader context for the question and its premise. This can help the system to identify implicit assumptions and relationships that are not explicitly stated in the question.\n\n4. **Data Augmentation:** Increase the size and diversity of the training data, particularly focusing on examples that expose the system to a wider range of information extraction scenarios and potential errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the extremely low accuracy and the identified weaknesses, the capability trend is **declining** or at best **stable at an unacceptably low level**. Significant changes are needed to improve performance. Without these changes, the system is not viable.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors were explicitly present in the provided 'output' fields for any of the error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nBased on the limited data (only error cases), it's difficult to definitively assess strengths. However, the following can be tentatively identified:\n\n1.  **Information Retrieval (Potential):** The system attempts to retrieve relevant information based on the questions, which is a fundamental requirement for question answering. This is evident in all error cases where the system generates an answer, even if incorrect.\n2.  **Attempt at Logical Reasoning (Potential):** In error case 1, the system includes the correct answer \"University of Chile,\" suggesting an attempt at extracting relevant information. Similarly, in error case 2, it provides a year, even though incorrect.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Information Extraction:** The system struggles to extract precise and accurate information from the knowledge source, leading to incorrect or incomplete answers. This is demonstrated in error cases 1 and 2 where the retrieved information is inaccurate.\n2.  **Failure to Verify Information and Handle Conflicting Information:** In error case 1, the system includes both the correct and an incorrect university, indicating a failure to verify the information and resolve conflicting options. The presence of both 'University of Chile' and 'American University' suggests a lack of validation before presenting a final answer.\n3. **Incorrect Premise Detection:** The system, in error case 1, falsely assumes the premise of the question is incorrect. This indicates a problem with understanding complex relationships and potentially a reliance on superficial patterns.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction and Verification:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to reliably extract accurate information and verify its correctness. This impacts both the generation of correct answers and the detection of invalid premises.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Inclusion of Incorrect Information:** A recurring pattern is the inclusion of incorrect information alongside potentially correct information (as seen in error case 1). This suggests a problem in discriminating between relevant and irrelevant or inaccurate data.\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Question's Premise:** One instance exists where the system declares the question's premise incorrect. While this is acceptable in some cases if done correctly, it indicates a failure to fully understand the implicit assumptions within the query (as seen in error case 2).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inaccurate and unreliable information extraction process, coupled with insufficient validation and error detection**. The system needs to be significantly improved in its ability to pinpoint the specific information required to answer the question correctly and verify that the retrieved information is accurate and relevant.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Implement more robust information extraction techniques that are less prone to retrieving irrelevant or inaccurate data. This might involve using more sophisticated pattern matching algorithms, incorporating semantic understanding, or utilizing external knowledge bases for verification.\n2.  **Information Verification:** Implement a verification mechanism that assesses the accuracy and consistency of extracted information before it is used to generate an answer. This could involve cross-referencing information from multiple sources, applying logical reasoning to check for inconsistencies, or using external validation tools.\n3.  **Question Understanding:** Improve the system's ability to understand the nuances of the question, including implicit assumptions and complex relationships. This might involve incorporating natural language understanding techniques such as semantic parsing or dependency parsing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a multi-stage information extraction process:**\n    *   **Stage 1: Focused Retrieval:** Retrieve a narrow set of potentially relevant information based on keywords and entity recognition.\n    *   **Stage 2: Semantic Filtering:** Filter the retrieved information based on semantic relevance to the question. Use techniques like sentence similarity or knowledge graph traversal to identify the most relevant pieces of information.\n    *   **Stage 3: Verification and Validation:** Verify the accuracy and consistency of the filtered information by cross-referencing with other sources, applying logical rules, or using external validation tools.\n2.  **Integrate external knowledge bases for validation:** Use external knowledge bases like Wikidata or DBpedia to validate extracted information and resolve ambiguities. For example, in error case 1, the system could consult Wikidata to verify that Ana Figueroa studied at the University of Chile and not at the American University.\n3.  **Improve question understanding through dependency parsing:** Use dependency parsing to identify the key entities and relationships in the question. This can help the system to formulate more precise queries for information retrieval and to identify implicit assumptions.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (extracted incorrect university)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify the correctness of both universities)\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly identified premise and genus)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (extracted incorrect year)\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using LLM-driven pattern recognition and iterative refinement. It decomposes the problem into information extraction, transformation rule inference using difference grid analysis, rule application, and verification/correction steps. No specific agent roles are defined other than \"an expert at grid transformation tasks\". The script uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API.\n\nThe overall workflow involves: `solve_grid_transformation` which calls `call_llm` to get `extracted_info`, then calls `call_llm` again to get `transformation_rule`, then one more time to get `transformed_grid`. The transformed grid is verified with another call to `call_llm`. If verification fails, `call_llm` is invoked again to correct the grid, and returns either the corrected or transformed grid.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**System Name:** Grid Transformation AI\n\n**Report Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**Version:** 1.0 (Based on Performance Summary and Error Analysis Report)\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal critical issues in the AI system's performance.\n\n*   **Sample 0:**  The \"Timeout\" error suggests a severe performance bottleneck. The system failed to generate an output within the 60-second time limit, indicating an inefficient algorithm or a problem with computational complexity. The inability to return *any* output makes this sample the most catastrophic failure.\n\n*   **Sample 1 & 2:** The system attempts to produce a JSON output, conforming to the requested format. However, the generated grid contains numbers that bear little to no relation to the expected transformation pattern based on the training data. The values appear random and violate any potential constraints derived from the example grid transformations. The grids are filled with inconsistencies and meaningless numbers.\n\n*   **Consistency:** Across all failed samples, there is a complete lack of consistency and correctness. The generated grids showcase no discernible transformation logic.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe current AI system demonstrates extremely limited capabilities in solving grid transformation problems. While it attempts to follow instructions regarding output format (JSON), its core functionality \u2013 recognizing and applying transformation patterns \u2013 is entirely non-functional. The system currently fails to perform even basic grid transformations and suffers from serious performance and logical flaws. The accuracy score of 0.00 highlights the critical need for substantial improvements.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **JSON Output:** The system's ability to produce JSON-formatted output is a minor strength. It demonstrates a basic understanding of the output requirements.\n*   **Potential for Pattern Recognition:** The system is *designed* for pattern recognition, hinting at the intention to learn and apply grid transformations. This suggests a potentially sound architectural approach that needs to be properly implemented.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Application:** The inability to accurately identify and apply transformation patterns is the most significant weakness. This renders the system essentially useless for its intended purpose.\n*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:** The timeout issue highlights a fundamental flaw in algorithmic efficiency. The system's performance degrades rapidly, making it unable to handle even moderately complex tasks within a reasonable time frame.\n*   **Robustness:** The system is highly susceptible to variations in the input data. Given it can't even process the presented data, any minor changes would be catastrophic.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks any self-verification mechanism, leading to nonsensical and invalid outputs.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Application**. Without a functional pattern recognition algorithm, the system cannot perform its core task and all other improvements are meaningless.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Refactor Pattern Recognition Algorithm:**\n    *   **Implement or replace the current algorithm with a more robust and appropriate method.** Consider Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), or explicitly modeling the transformation logic with conditional rules.\n    *   **Design dedicated Feature Extraction:**  Before pattern recognition, implement a feature extraction module that identifies key elements (numbers, locations, relationships) in the input and output grids. These features will serve as inputs to the pattern recognition algorithm.\n\n2.  **Address Algorithmic Efficiency:**\n    *   **Profile the code to identify specific performance bottlenecks:**  Determine where the algorithm spends the most time and focus optimization efforts there.\n    *   **Implement a simpler, more efficient initial approach:**  Before resorting to complex neural network architectures, try implementing a more straightforward rule-based or search-based algorithm.  This will allow for easier debugging and faster iteration.\n\n3. **Implement immediate debugging and monitoring:**\n    *   **Add extensive logging statements throughout the code:** Track execution flow, variable values, and intermediate results to understand the system's behavior.\n    *   **Create a suite of Unit Tests:** Design tests to verify the correctness of individual components, such as feature extraction, pattern matching, and grid transformation functions. Start with the smallest, most fundamental components and gradually increase complexity.\n\n4.  **Test-Driven Development Approach:** Write test cases that describe the expected behavior *before* implementing any code. This will help ensure that the code meets the requirements and prevent regressions as changes are made.  Focus on *simple* test cases first.\n5.   **Implement a Basic Solution Validator:** Even a simple validator can catch obvious errors. For example, if the training examples involve adding a constant value to each cell, the validator can check if the output grid follows this pattern.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided performance data, the system's capabilities are currently **declining**. The complete lack of accuracy and the timeout error indicate a severe regression in performance.\n",

    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**System Name:** Grid Transformation AI\n\n**Report Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**Version:** 1.0 (Based on Performance Summary and Error Analysis Report)\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal critical issues in the AI system's performance.\n\n*   **Sample 0:**  The \"Timeout\" error suggests a severe performance bottleneck. The system failed to generate an output within the 60-second time limit, indicating an inefficient algorithm or a problem with computational complexity. The inability to return *any* output makes this sample the most catastrophic failure.\n\n*   **Sample 1 & 2:** The system attempts to produce a JSON output, conforming to the requested format. However, the generated grid contains numbers that bear little to no relation to the expected transformation pattern based on the training data. The values appear random and violate any potential constraints derived from the example grid transformations. The grids are filled with inconsistencies and meaningless numbers.\n\n*   **Consistency:** Across all failed samples, there is a complete lack of consistency and correctness. The generated grids showcase no discernible transformation logic.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe current AI system demonstrates extremely limited capabilities in solving grid transformation problems. While it attempts to follow instructions regarding output format (JSON), its core functionality \u2013 recognizing and applying transformation patterns \u2013 is entirely non-functional. The system currently fails to perform even basic grid transformations and suffers from serious performance and logical flaws. The accuracy score of 0.00 highlights the critical need for substantial improvements.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **JSON Output:** The system's ability to produce JSON-formatted output is a minor strength. It demonstrates a basic understanding of the output requirements.\n*   **Potential for Pattern Recognition:** The system is *designed* for pattern recognition, hinting at the intention to learn and apply grid transformations. This suggests a potentially sound architectural approach that needs to be properly implemented.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Application:** The inability to accurately identify and apply transformation patterns is the most significant weakness. This renders the system essentially useless for its intended purpose.\n*   **Algorithmic Efficiency:** The timeout issue highlights a fundamental flaw in algorithmic efficiency. The system's performance degrades rapidly, making it unable to handle even moderately complex tasks within a reasonable time frame.\n*   **Robustness:** The system is highly susceptible to variations in the input data. Given it can't even process the presented data, any minor changes would be catastrophic.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks any self-verification mechanism, leading to nonsensical and invalid outputs.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Application**.

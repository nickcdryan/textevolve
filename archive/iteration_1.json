  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach with chain-of-thought prompting to answer questions by identifying the question type, extracting relevant information, generating an answer, and then verifying the answer. The script uses the following functions: `main` orchestrates the entire process, `analyze_question` identifies the question type and keywords, `extract_relevant_passage` retrieves relevant text, `generate_answer` formulates an initial answer, `verify_answer` validates the answer, and `call_llm` interacts with the Gemini LLM, using system instructions and prompts to guide the LLM's reasoning at each step. The workflow starts with `main` calling `analyze_question`, followed by `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer`, each leveraging `call_llm` to interact with the LLM.",

The use of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags is consistent.  The system correctly handles a percentage with a decimal. The third output, \"22,341\", suggests the system can handle numbers with commas. However, this is based on a very limited dataset.  We need to see more examples to ensure consistency and robustness.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nBased on the limited data provided, the AI system demonstrates a basic capability for extracting numerical values and percentages from text. It seems to correctly isolate the numerical values.  However, the assessment is severely limited by the lack of error cases. We can only confirm successful operation in a few scenarios. The reliability and generalizability of the system remain unknown.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Numerical Extraction:**  The system can accurately extract numerical values and percentages when presented in a clear, unambiguous format. The use of consistent tags like `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` provides a structured output.\n*   **Percentage Handling:** Correctly identifies and extracts percentages.\n*   **Number Formatting Handling:** The system appears to handle numbers with commas correctly.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Lack of Robustness Data:** The absence of error cases prevents a meaningful analysis of the system's weaknesses. We don't know how it handles edge cases, ambiguous inputs, incorrect formats, or missing values.\n*   **Unknown Contextual Understanding:** The system appears to extract the values without understanding the context. It might extract numbers that are not relevant to the desired information.\n*   **Limited Error Reporting:** The system offers no information about *why* an extraction failed, or if it even noticed that a failure occurred.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe primary focus should be on improving the *robustness* of the system. This means understanding its limitations and handling more diverse and potentially erroneous inputs gracefully. Specifically, the system needs to:\n\n1.  **Understand Context:** The system should attempt to understand the context of the numerical data.\n2.  **Improve Error Handling:** The system needs to be able to identify errors in extraction and report them to the user.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Introduce Error Cases:**  Create a dataset containing various error cases:\n    *   **Ambiguous Numerical Values:** \"approximately 50\", \"fiftyish\"\n    *   **Incorrect Formats:** \"123.456.789\", \"123,,456\"\n    *   **Missing Values:** Sentences where the expected numerical value is absent.\n    *   **Contextually Irrelevant Numbers:**  Include numbers in the text that are not relevant to the task, and ensure the system ignores them.\n    *   **Overlapping numbers:** \"12345\" and \"23456\" in the same text.\n2.  **Implement Error Reporting:**  If the system cannot reliably extract a number, it should return an error message indicating the failure and the reason (e.g., \"Could not find a valid number\", \"Ambiguous numerical value found\").\n3.  **Expand Training Data:**  Increase the size and diversity of the training dataset to include a wider range of number formats, contexts, and potential errors.\n4.  **Add Contextual Understanding:** Investigate methods to help the system understand the context of the numbers in the text.\n5.  **Output Confidence Scores:** Add confidence scores to each extraction to indicate how sure the system is that the extracted value is correct. This helps in downstream error detection.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the limited information, it is difficult to determine a capability trend. However, given the high accuracy on the limited data, the trend is currently **stable**.  Further data and error analysis are needed to determine if the capabilities are improving, declining, or stagnating as the system encounters more complex scenarios.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM-driven approach with explicit rule extraction and validation. It decomposes the problem into extracting the transformation rule, applying it to the input grid, and verifying the output grid. The agent roles are implicit, defined through system instructions for rule extraction, application, and output verification.\n\n**Function Summary:**\n- `solve_grid_transformation`: orchestrates the end-to-end transformation process, calling `extract_transformation_rule`, `apply_transformation_rule`, and `verify_output_grid`.\n- `extract_transformation_rule`: extracts the rule from a given question via the `call_llm` function, then uses `call_llm` again to validate the extracted transformation rule.\n- `apply_transformation_rule`: applies a transformation rule to a given question via the `call_llm` function.\n- `verify_output_grid`: validates the output transformation via the `call_llm` function.\n- `call_llm`: calls the Gemini LLM with a prompt and system instruction and returns the response.\n- `main`: calls the `solve_grid_transformation` function to generate an answer for the given question.\n\nThe overall workflow involves extracting a transformation rule from the input question, validating this rule, applying the validated rule to generate an output, and then verifying the generated output for correctness.",

The described rules in the 'output' field do not accurately reflect the underlying patterns.\n2.  **Limited Generalization:** The system struggles to generalize from the training examples to the test input, indicating a lack of robust pattern recognition capabilities.\n3.  **Lack of Verification:** Even when a transformation rule is proposed, the system fails to verify it against the training examples or a mental model to confirm that it is working.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Failure in Pattern Recognition:** The core bottleneck is the system's inability to accurately recognize and encode the underlying transformation patterns within the grid examples. It seems to get lost in local details rather than capturing the overall logic.\n2.  **Absence of Verification Step:** The system lacks a rigorous verification step to confirm whether the extracted transformation rule produces outputs consistent with the training data *before* attempting to apply it to the test input.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Conditional Logic:**  The generated code and the inferred transformation rules rely heavily on conditional logic related to specific values and positions within the grid. This approach appears fragile and prone to errors when dealing with even slightly different grid configurations.\n2.  **Ignoring Context:** The system appears to focus on individual cell transformations without considering the broader context or relationships between cells.

If the validated outputs fail to align, reject the rule and try again.\n3.  **Refine the search space for rules:** Rather than generating arbitrary rules, constrain the search to rules that are likely to be meaningful based on the problem domain. For example, rules that involve symmetrical transformations, or transformations based on proximity to certain values.\n4.  **Introduce a mechanism for iterative refinement:** Allow the system to refine its transformation rule iteratively based on feedback from the training examples.

The errors indicate confusion about the relationships between input and output. It cycles through several flawed attempts, showing a lack of convergence towards a correct solution. The repeated \"Error: Could not extract a valid transformation rule\" indicates a core inability to learn from the examples.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system generates Python code that attempts to transform the grid. However, the code's logic is based on hardcoded column indices related to the value '5'. This approach is highly brittle and lacks generalization. The output grid confirms that the transformation only applies to specific locations of the '5' and does not capture the underlying transformation logic. The code also introduces new values (1, 2, 3, 4) without justification from the training examples, suggesting hallucinations or irrelevant assumptions.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** Similar to Sample ID 0, the system attempts to describe transformation rules in natural language, resulting in invalid and contradictory rules. The attempts focus on localized patterns and fail to capture the overall transformation logic. It focuses on areas where it identifies features and misses the more broad transformation. The system struggles to formulate a coherent strategy for generalizing from the training data.\n\n**Patterns in the Execution Outputs:**\n\n*   **Brittle Rules:** The system tends to create rules that are highly specific to the training examples, rather than generalizable to new inputs. The rules often rely on specific values and their locations within the grid.\n*   **Hallucination of Logic:** The system introduces elements into the transformation that are not directly supported by the input/output training examples (e.g., introducing new values without precedent).\n*   **Repetitive Failures:** The system often repeats similar errors, suggesting a lack of learning from its mistakes.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a **very limited** capability in solving grid transformation problems. While it can generate code and attempt to extract transformation rules, it consistently fails to do so accurately or reliably. It struggles with pattern recognition, generalization, and rule verification. The system is currently unable to perform the core task of inferring transformation logic from training examples and applying it to new inputs.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The ability to generate Python code provides a foundation for implementing transformation logic, even if the logic is currently flawed.\n*   **Attempted Rule Extraction:** The system attempts to identify and describe transformation rules, indicating an understanding of the task's requirements.\n*   **Constraint Identification (Attempted):** The system identifies specific features in the grid, such as the presence of the number 5, and attempts to use this information in its transformations.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Rule Extraction:** The system consistently fails to extract accurate and complete transformation rules.\n*   **Lack of Generalization:** The system struggles to generalize from the training examples to the test input.\n*   **Absence of Verification Step:** The system lacks a verification step to confirm whether the extracted rule produces outputs consistent with the training data.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **pattern recognition**. The system needs to be able to identify robust and generalizable transformation rules from the training examples. Without accurate pattern recognition, the other capabilities are rendered ineffective.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Rule Validation Phase:**\n    *   **Details:** After extracting a potential rule, run it on the training examples and check if the generated outputs match the provided training outputs. Implement a threshold for acceptable matches (e.g., 100% accuracy on the training set).\n    *   **Benefit:** This will prevent the system from applying incorrect rules to the test input and provide valuable feedback for refining the pattern recognition process.\n\n2.  **Introduce a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Graph Neural Network (GNN) for Pattern Recognition:**\n    *   **Details:** Train a CNN or GNN on a large dataset of grid transformation problems. These models are specifically designed to capture spatial relationships in grid-like data. Fine-tune the model on the specific types of transformations required by the current task.\n    *   **Benefit:** These models have a stronger track record than current methods in solving the problem\n\n3.  **Refine the Search Space for Rules Using Symmetries and Proximity:**\n    *   **Details:** Constrain the search for rules to those that are likely to be meaningful based on the problem domain.\n        *   Prioritize rules that involve symmetrical transformations.\n        *   Prioritize rules that operate on local neighbourhoods, where cells depend on nearby cells.\n\n4.  **Implement a Mechanism for Iterative Refinement:**\n    *   **Details:** Allow the system to refine its transformation rule iteratively based on feedback from the training examples. This could involve techniques such as reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization.\n    *   **Benefit:** The system can learn from its mistakes and converge towards a more accurate and generalizable solution.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are **stable but essentially non-functional**. The system consistently fails to solve the task, indicating a lack of progress.

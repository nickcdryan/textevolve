The system\n    attempts to mimic a human expert reasoning through the problem step-by-step.\n    This avoids both the purely regex-based and fuzzy logic approaches from previous iterations,\n    and the backtracking which proved unstable.\n\n    Error Handling:\n    The function includes robust error handling to catch missing or malformed input data,\n    preventing the script from crashing.

The test script expects this function to exist, so it's critical that it's present and has the correct signature (i.e., takes the correct arguments if any).",

        "3. **Ensure correct code execution and entry point:** The execution of the code in `current_script_1.py` needs to correctly define the `main` function, possibly by using an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to conditionally define the function, and only call or run code when the script is run directly.",
        "4. **Review the test script:** Double-check the test script ('test_script_1.py') to confirm it's correctly importing and calling the 'main' function with the appropriate arguments. Make sure the file path is correct and no typos exist in the import statement.",
        "5. **Consistent naming and file locations:** Verify that the files are located in the directories assumed by the import statements in the test script. Ensure that there are no naming conflicts or hidden files interfering with the import process.",
        "6. **Debugging:** Add print statements to 'current_script_1.py' before and after the definition of the 'main' function to see whether that part of the code is even being reached during testing. This helps pinpoint the exact location where the import fails.",
        "7. **Consider restructuring the project.** The use of `current_script_1.py` is not descriptive. Consider using a more informative name and refactor the code so that the main function is properly defined and importable.  This also helps with long-term maintainability."

        "4. **Code execution path:** The `main` function may not be defined if the script is not run directly, possibly missing the `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard",

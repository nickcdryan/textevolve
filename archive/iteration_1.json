  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-agent approach with information extraction, scheduling, and verification agents driven by the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into extracting relevant information (participants, constraints), finding a potential meeting time, and verifying the solution against the original constraints. Each step uses few-shot learning by providing the LLM with an example to guide its reasoning and output.",

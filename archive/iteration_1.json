  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to answer questions by first determining the question type, then extracting relevant information, and finally generating the answer using the Gemini LLM. The problem is decomposed into three functions: `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, and `generate_answer`, each acting as an agent with a specific role. The `call_llm` function is used to interface with the Gemini model, with the main function orchestrating the calls. The workflow is: main -> determine_question_type -> extract_relevant_info -> generate_answer, with each step passing information to the next.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Colts began their 2013 season at home, for the first time since 2009, against the Oakland Raiders.  The Raiders, who received the opening kickoff, would turn the ball over on a Terrelle Pryor interception by Colts cornerback Greg Toler.  The interception would allow Andrew Luck and the Colts offense to drive down the field and score the first touchdown of the season on a pass from Luck to Reggie Wayne.  Heading into the second quarter, the Colts defense would continue to prevent the Raiders from scoring, forcing Oakland to punt on second drive of the game.  Luck would again lead the Colts down the field in an eight play, 69 yard drive that would result in a touchdown pass from Luck to tight end Dwayne Allen, giving the Colts an early 14-0 lead.  Pryor and the Raiders would respond for the first time on their next offensive drive, which ended in a touchdown run from Darren McFadden.  Defensive stops by both the Colts and the Raiders would ensure no further scoring in the half and would allow Indianapolis to head into halftime with the 14-7 lead.  Indianapolis was forced to punt on their first offensive possession of the second half, while the Raiders would drive down to the Colts 20 yard line and would score on a Sebastian Janikowski field goal, cutting the Colts lead to 14-10 lead.  The Raiders would again begin to drive down the field and would score the go ahead touchdown early in the fourth quarter on a pass from Denarius Moore from Terrelle Pryor, giving the Raiders a 17-14 lead.  Andrew Luck, on the next Colts offensive drive, would lead the team down the field, 71 yards in 11 plays, with Luck himself scoring the game-winning touchdown on a 19-yard run.  Pryor and the Raiders would drive down to the Colts 24 yard line, though the drive would end with an interception by Antoine Bethea, sealing the Colts victory.

      "question": "PASSAGE: After their big road win in Washington, the Eagles hosted the winless Miami Dolphins at muddy Lincoln Financial Field and won 17-7. The offenses struggled in the first quarter, and the first points would actually come via special teams in the second quarter, when Ted Ginn Jr. returned a punt 87 yards to paydirt for Miami. Later in the quarter, McNabb, who had already thrown two interceptions, was hit as he threw, spraining his ankle. David Akers came on to make a 34-yard field goal, and McNabb left the game. A. J. Feeley was spun up to play quarterback, but threw an interception of his own on his first drive. In the third quarter, Correll Buckhalter took the ball in from eight yards out for the go-ahead touchdown, making it 10-7. Feeley, after some helpful runs from running back Brian Westbrook, connected with receiver Jason Avant to increase the lead. The defense played a strong second half, and Westbrook carried seven times on the final drive, which killed the final 6:40 of the game.

The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags provide clear delimiters for the system's responses.\n\n*   **Observations:** The system seems competent in extracting numerical data and performing basic arithmetic. It also demonstrates some level of reasoning in comparing values (Sample ID 1).\n*   **Potential Concerns:** The lack of error cases makes it difficult to identify potential failure points. The system might be brittle and struggle with edge cases or more complex reasoning scenarios. The reliance on `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags could become a bottleneck if the system struggles to accurately delineate the answers in more complex scenarios.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the AI system demonstrates strong capabilities in:\n\n*   **Numerical Extraction:**  Accurately identifying and extracting numerical data from text.\n*   **Arithmetic Operations:** Performing basic arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction).\n*   **Comparative Reasoning:** Making comparisons based on extracted numerical values.\n\nHowever, the limited data highlights potential weaknesses related to:\n\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Dependence on explicitly stated information.\n*   **General Knowledge:** Lack of general knowledge to supplement missing information.\n*   **Handling Ambiguity:**  Potential difficulties in interpreting ambiguous questions.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **High Accuracy on Provided Samples:** The system achieves 100% accuracy on the limited dataset, indicating a solid foundation in the tested areas.\n*   **Clear Output Format:** The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags provide a structured and easily parsable output.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\nThe most critical weakness, based on predicted performance gaps, is **Reliance on Explicit Data and Lack of Implicit Information Extraction**. The system appears to struggle when the answer requires inferences beyond the explicitly stated information in the provided text. Without error cases, determining the actual critical weaknesses is impossible. However, focusing on handling implicit information is a good starting point.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary focus for improvement should be **enhancing the system's ability to infer implicit information from the provided context.** This includes improving the ability to extract, understand, and connect concepts, even when they are not directly stated.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce a Negation Detection Module:** Implement a module that recognizes and handles negation in the text. This will prevent misinterpretation of statements like \"did *not* increase\" or \"is *less* than\". This module would involve using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify and understand the scope of negations in sentences.\n2.  **Implement a Contextual Awareness Module:** Develop a module that can understand the context of the information. Consider building a system that can link different entities, events, and their connections.\n3.  **Generate Negative Test Cases:** Create a more diverse set of test cases, including examples with missing information, ambiguous questions, and implicit relationships, to identify the system's limitations.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nWithout historical performance data, it's impossible to determine the capability trend.  However, consistent monitoring and testing with a diverse set of inputs are crucial to track progress and identify emerging weaknesses.

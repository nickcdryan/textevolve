  "approach_summary": "The script addresses grid transformation problems using an LLM to extract and apply transformation rules. It decomposes the problem into rule extraction, rule application, and output verification steps, with the LLM acting as an expert rule identifier, grid transformer, and format verifier. The main functions are `extract_transformation_rule` (extracts rules from examples using the LLM), `apply_transformation_rule` (applies the extracted rule to a test grid via the LLM), and `verify_output_grid` (verifies the output format using the LLM); `main` orchestrates the workflow: it extracts a rule, applies it to generate an output grid, and then verifies the output.",

      "text_report": "Here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and requirements:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis.  Specifically:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output matrix is significantly larger than any reasonable transformation of the input, indicating a complete failure to understand and apply the intended pattern. It seems to be replicating parts of the input multiple times.  The generated matrix has dimensions 26x26, while reasonable answers are expected to be on the order of 6x6.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The output appears to be attempting to replicate the structure of the input, but the values are incorrect. There's some clustering of similar values, but no clear relationship to the input.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**  Similar to Sample ID 0, the output exhibits a large and seemingly random transformation. There is some partitioning of the region into blocks containing the same value which is a good sign, but the values are incorrect. It appears that there might be an element of block replication present.\n\nThe \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers are correctly placed in the output, indicating that the system knows where the answer block should be placed, but the answer itself is wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a *very low* level of capability in solving abstract reasoning tasks, as evidenced by a 0% accuracy rate. It shows a nascent ability to recognize grid structures, but fails to correctly apply transformations and struggles with generalizing patterns. The system's performance suggests overfitting to training data or a fundamental misunderstanding of the underlying task.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structural Mimicry:** The system attempts to maintain the grid structure from the input in its output, suggesting a basic understanding of the output format requirements.\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Basic):** The system can identify repeating regions/structures in the grid.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The system *completely* fails to generalize learned patterns to unseen data. This is the dominant weakness.\n*   **Value Mapping:** Incorrect value substitutions indicate a failure in mapping input values to their corresponding output values based on learned patterns.\n*   **Dimensionality Control:** Inconsistent output matrix sizes suggest a lack of control over output dimensionality.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. The system needs to learn abstract transformation rules that can be applied to a wider range of inputs, rather than overfitting to specific training examples.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Curriculum Learning:** Implement a curriculum learning strategy, starting with simpler transformation patterns and gradually increasing complexity. Start with simple matrix size and value transformations.\n2.  **Augment Training Data (Strategic):** Don't just add *more* data, add *targeted* data. Identify specific pattern types that are consistently causing errors and generate training examples specifically addressing those patterns. Include negative examples, where the system is explicitly shown what *not* to do.  Ensure the training data covers a diverse range of transformations, including value shifts, rotations, reflections, and combinations thereof. Focus on cases where the same input pattern can have different output patterns depending on context.\n3.  **Introduce Intermediate Reasoning Steps and Logging:** Modify the code to include intermediate steps in the reasoning process, logging the values of key variables at each step. This allows for debugging and understanding where the system is going wrong. Example steps:\n    *   Input Analysis: Log the identified patterns, dimensions, and key features of the input grid.\n    *   Transformation Rule Selection: Log the transformation rule that is being applied and the reasons for its selection.\n    *   Output Generation: Log the steps involved in generating the output grid, including value substitutions and dimension adjustments.\n4.  **Implement Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation techniques to evaluate the system's performance on different subsets of the training data. This helps to identify overfitting and to ensure that the system is learning generalizable patterns.\n5.  **Simplify Transformation Logic:** Review and simplify the transformation logic to reduce complexity and improve clarity. Ensure that the logic is consistent with the underlying transformation rules.\n6. **Error Analysis Framework:** Create a structured error analysis framework that automatically categorizes errors based on type (e.g., value substitution, dimensionality mismatch, incorrect pattern selection). This will enable more efficient and targeted debugging and improvement efforts.\n7.  **Input Normalization and Feature Engineering:** Normalize the input data and engineer relevant features to make it easier for the system to learn generalizable patterns. For example, create features that represent the relative positions of cells, the frequency of values, and the presence of specific patterns.\n8. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** As new functionality and fixes are added, create automated tests based on a comprehensive test suite to ensure that it is working correctly and doesn't introduce any regressions.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the 0% accuracy, the capability trend is currently **stable at a very low level**. Without significant improvements in pattern generalization, the system will not progress.\n",

The error messages \"list index out of range\" and \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" suggest that the system is unable to handle variations in input structure.\n- **Insufficient Error Handling:** The system does not have sufficient error handling to gracefully recover from parsing errors. When parsing fails, the system simply crashes or throws a generic error message, rather than attempting to diagnose the issue or provide a partial solution.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- **Parsing Errors:** The dominant error pattern is the inability to parse the input text correctly.

The parsing needs to be replaced with LLM calls for information extraction.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Information Extraction:** The system needs a more robust and flexible information extraction mechanism that can handle variations in input format.

For instance, use `extract_information(text, \"What are the names of all participants mentioned?\")` instead of `re.search(r\"schedule a meeting for (.*?) for\", line)`. This replaces brittle, rule-based parsing with LLM understanding.\n2. **Implement a parsing verification step:** After extracting information, use another LLM call to verify the completeness and correctness of the extracted information. For example, call a `verifier_agent(extracted_data, question)` which can determine if anything is missing or misinterpreted. This adds a verification layer to prevent incorrect data from propagating.\n3. **Implement more informative error handling:**  Instead of generic \"Error: Expecting value\" errors, catch specific exceptions during parsing and provide more context. For example, if the participant list is empty, log a message \"Could not find participants in the question.\" This enables easier debugging.\n4. **Implement input validation:** Add validation checks to ensure that the extracted data meets certain criteria, such as the presence of a valid meeting duration or the availability of time slots within the specified work hours.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample ID 0:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n- **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n- **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n- **Sample ID 3:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n- **Sample ID 4:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system, in its current state, demonstrates a theoretical understanding of the problem domain (complex scheduling) and an awareness of beneficial design principles (LLM prompt engineering). However, the practical implementation is fundamentally flawed due to an over-reliance on brittle parsing techniques and insufficient error handling. The system currently possesses virtually no problem-solving capability as it fails on all provided test cases. It needs to shift to LLM-driven information extraction and focus on robust error handling.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Intentional Design:** The system is designed with the *intention* to leverage participant schedules and meeting duration and preferences using LLMs.\n*   **Prompt Awareness:** The system demonstrates an understanding of the importance of clear and explicit prompt design.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Brittle Input Parsing:** The system's reliance on rigid parsing techniques makes it highly vulnerable to variations in input format.\n*   **Insufficient Error Handling:** The system lacks robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully recover from parsing failures and provide informative error messages.\n*   **Lack of LLM usage:** The system has failed to incorporate any of the recommended LLM-centric approaches, relying instead on simple rules and regex.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **information extraction**. The system must be able to reliably and accurately extract relevant information from the input text, regardless of minor variations in format. This requires a shift away from brittle regex-based parsing and towards LLM-driven extraction techniques.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   **Replace Rule-Based Parsing with LLM Calls:** Completely remove the existing regex/rule-based parsing logic. Instead, utilize LLM calls to extract key information such as participant names, schedules, and meeting constraints. Example:\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_details(text):\n            prompt = f\"Extract the following from the text: participant names, proposed meeting duration (if any), explicit constraints or preferences, and other relevant information related to scheduling.  Return the extracted information in a structured JSON format.\"\n            llm_response = call_llm(prompt, system=\"You are an expert information extraction agent.\")\n            return parse_json_with_retry(llm_response) # Use retry to handle LLM JSON format errors\n        ```\n    *   **JSON Parsing with Robustness:** When parsing JSON responses from the LLM, implement robust error handling with retries.  LLMs may occasionally produce invalid JSON.\n        ```python\n        import json\n        import time\n\n        def parse_json_with_retry(json_string, max_attempts=3, delay=1):\n            for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n                try:\n                    return json.loads(json_string)\n                except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                    if attempt < max_attempts - 1:\n                        print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}. Retrying in {delay} seconds...\")\n                        time.sleep(delay)\n                    else:\n                        print(f\"Failed to parse JSON after {max_attempts} attempts. Returning None.\")\n                        return None  # or raise the exception, depending on desired behavior\n        ```\n\n2.  **Implement Parsing Verification with LLMs:**\n    *   **Create a Verification Agent:** After extracting information, use a separate LLM call to verify the completeness and correctness of the extracted data. This could involve asking the LLM to summarize the extracted information and compare it to the original input text.\n        ```python\n        def verify_extracted_information(original_text, extracted_data):\n            prompt = f\"You are a verifier agent. You will check if the following extracted information is complete and correct compared to the original text.\\n\\nOriginal Text: {original_text}\\n\\nExtracted Data: {extracted_data}\\n\\nRespond with 'COMPLETE AND CORRECT', 'INCOMPLETE', or 'INCORRECT'. If 'INCOMPLETE' or 'INCORRECT', provide a brief explanation of the missing or incorrect information.\"\n            llm_response = call_llm(prompt, system=\"You are a meticulous verifier agent.\")\n            return llm_response\n        ```\n\n3.  **Improve Error Handling:**\n    *   **Catch Specific Exceptions:** Implement `try-except` blocks to catch specific exceptions that may occur during parsing (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError`).\n    *   **Provide Informative Error Messages:**  Within the `except` blocks, log informative error messages that include details about the specific error, the input text, and the expected format.\n\n4.  **Capability Mapping:**\n    *   Update the `CAPABILITY_MAPPING` to use more descriptive labels and tie them directly to the code being executed. Remove solution generation until information extraction is functional.\n    *   **Sample ID 0:** information_extraction_llm, verification\n    *   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction_llm, verification\n    *   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction_llm, verification\n    *   **Sample ID 3:** information_extraction_llm, verification\n    *   **Sample ID 4:** information_extraction_llm, verification\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the system demonstrates a **declining** capability trend, as it consistently fails to solve any of the provided problems. The trend will remain negative until the critical weaknesses in input parsing and error handling are addressed, using LLM-driven information extraction.\n",

For instance, use `extract_information(text, \"What are the names of all participants mentioned?\")` instead of `re.search(r\"schedule a meeting for (.*?) for\", line)`. This replaces brittle, rule-based parsing with LLM understanding.\n2. **Implement a parsing verification step:** After extracting information, use another LLM call to verify the completeness and correctness of the extracted information. For example, call a `verifier_agent(extracted_data, question)` which can determine if anything is missing or misinterpreted. This adds a verification layer to prevent incorrect data from propagating.\n3. **Implement more informative error handling:**  Instead of generic \"Error: Expecting value\" errors, catch specific exceptions during parsing and provide more context. For example, if the participant list is empty, log a message \"Could not find participants in the question.\" This enables easier debugging.\n4. **Implement input validation:** Add validation checks to ensure that the extracted data meets certain criteria, such as the presence of a valid meeting duration or the availability of time slots within the specified work hours.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample ID 0:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n- **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n- **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n- **Sample ID 3:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n- **Sample ID 4:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system, in its current state, demonstrates a theoretical understanding of the problem domain (complex scheduling) and an awareness of beneficial design principles (LLM prompt engineering). However, the practical implementation is fundamentally flawed due to an over-reliance on brittle parsing techniques and insufficient error handling. The system currently possesses virtually no problem-solving capability as it fails on all provided test cases. It needs to shift to LLM-driven information extraction and focus on robust error handling.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Intentional Design:** The system is designed with the *intention* to leverage participant schedules and meeting duration and preferences using LLMs.\n*   **Prompt Awareness:** The system demonstrates an understanding of the importance of clear and explicit prompt design.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Brittle Input Parsing:** The system's reliance on rigid parsing techniques makes it highly vulnerable to variations in input format.\n*   **Insufficient Error Handling:** The system lacks robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully recover from parsing failures and provide informative error messages.\n*   **Lack of LLM usage:** The system has failed to incorporate any of the recommended LLM-centric approaches, relying instead on simple rules and regex.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **information extraction**. The system must be able to reliably and accurately extract relevant information from the input text, regardless of minor variations in format. This requires a shift away from brittle regex-based parsing and towards LLM-driven extraction techniques.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   **Replace Rule-Based Parsing with LLM Calls:** Completely remove the existing regex/rule-based parsing logic. Instead, utilize LLM calls to extract key information such as participant names, schedules, and meeting constraints. Example:\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_details(text):\n            prompt = f\"Extract the following from the text: participant names, proposed meeting duration (if any), explicit constraints or preferences, and other relevant information related to scheduling.  Return the extracted information in a structured JSON format.\"\n            llm_response = call_llm(prompt, system=\"You are an expert information extraction agent.\")\n            return parse_json_with_retry(llm_response) # Use retry to handle LLM JSON format errors\n        ```\n    *   **JSON Parsing with Robustness:** When parsing JSON responses from the LLM, implement robust error handling with retries.  LLMs may occasionally produce invalid JSON.\n        ```python\n        import json\n        import time\n\n        def parse_json_with_retry(json_string, max_attempts=3, delay=1):\n            for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n                try:\n                    return json.loads(json_string)\n                except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n                    if attempt < max_attempts - 1:\n                        print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}. Retrying in {delay} seconds...\")\n                        time.sleep(delay)\n                    else:\n                        print(f\"Failed to parse JSON after {max_attempts} attempts. Returning None.\")\n                        return None  # or raise the exception, depending on desired behavior\n        ```\n\n2.  **Implement Parsing Verification with LLMs:**\n    *   **Create a Verification Agent:** After extracting information, use a separate LLM call to verify the completeness and correctness of the extracted data. This could involve asking the LLM to summarize the extracted information and compare it to the original input text.\n        ```python\n        def verify_extracted_information(original_text, extracted_data):\n            prompt = f\"You are a verifier agent. You will check if the following extracted information is complete and correct compared to the original text.\\n\\nOriginal Text: {original_text}\\n\\nExtracted Data: {extracted_data}\\n\\nRespond with 'COMPLETE AND CORRECT', 'INCOMPLETE', or 'INCORRECT'. If 'INCOMPLETE' or 'INCORRECT', provide a brief explanation of the missing or incorrect information.\"\n            llm_response = call_llm(prompt, system=\"You are a meticulous verifier agent.\")\n            return llm_response\n        ```\n\n3.  **Improve Error Handling:**\n    *   **Catch Specific Exceptions:** Implement `try-except` blocks to catch specific exceptions that may occur during parsing (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError`).\n    *   **Provide Informative Error Messages:**  Within the `except` blocks, log informative error messages that include details about the specific error, the input text, and the expected format.\n\n4.  **Capability Mapping:**\n    *   Update the `CAPABILITY_MAPPING` to use more descriptive labels and tie them directly to the code being executed. Remove solution generation until information extraction is functional.\n    *   **Sample ID 0:** information_extraction_llm, verification\n    *   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction_llm, verification\n    *   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction_llm, verification\n    *   **Sample ID 3:** information_extraction_llm, verification\n    *   **Sample ID 4:** information_extraction_llm, verification\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the system demonstrates a **declining** capability trend, as it consistently fails to solve any of the provided problems. The trend will remain negative until the critical weaknesses in input parsing and error handling are addressed, using LLM-driven information extraction.\n"

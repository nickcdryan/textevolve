  "approach_summary": "This script employs an LLM-driven agentic approach to answer questions by first analyzing the question type, then generating a step-by-step reasoning plan, and finally executing the plan to provide the answer. It uses chain-of-thought prompting to decompose the problem into question analysis, plan generation, and plan execution. There are no explicit agent roles, but the `call_llm` function interacts with the Gemini model, and the `main` function orchestrates the overall process.\n\nThe script uses the following functions:\n1.  `call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None)`: Sends a prompt to the LLM and returns the response.\n2.  `main(question)`: Orchestrates the entire process, calling `call_llm` to analyze the question, generate a plan, and execute the plan to provide a final answer.\n\nThe overall workflow starts with a question passed to the `main` function, which uses `call_llm` three times to determine the reasoning type, create a plan, and generate a final answer, respectively.",

Call ListModels to see the list of available models and their supported methods.\" appears in the 'output' field of all three error cases. This indicates a critical runtime error: the specified LLM model (\"gemini-pro\") is not available or accessible through the API being used. This is likely an environment configuration or API access issue, not a problem in the core reasoning logic.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   The system correctly identified that the problem requires abstract reasoning and visual pattern recognition (as indicated by the problem instructions).\n*   The system attempted to follow the problem solving instructions (analyze examples, infer rules, apply to test case).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   The system consistently fails to determine the transformation rule required for the \"Grid Transformation Task\".\n*   The system experiences runtime errors due to unavailability of the specified LLM model.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM Availability:** The primary bottleneck is the inability to access and utilize the specified LLM model (\"gemini-pro\"). This completely halts the reasoning process.\n2.  **Pattern Recognition Failure:** Even if the LLM was available, the system seems to lack the capacity to accurately identify the visual transformation rules in the grid examples.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   All error cases result in the same \"Could not determine the type of reasoning required\" output, suggesting a fundamental issue with pattern recognition.\n*   The \"404\" error indicates a recurring environment configuration or API access issue.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem to fix is the LLM availability issue. Without a functional LLM, no problem-solving is possible. This is followed closely by improving the visual pattern recognition capability when/if the LLM issue is fixed.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Connectivity:** Ensure proper API configuration, model availability, and authentication to resolve the runtime error. Implement error handling with informative messages for the user.\n2.  **Visual Pattern Recognition:** Enhance the system's ability to identify and generalize visual patterns within the grid examples. This might involve exploring different LLM models (if available), or incorporating Computer Vision based tools with the LLM.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Verify API Setup:** Double-check API keys, endpoint URLs, and model names to ensure they are correct and up-to-date. Check the access permissions of the api keys as well.\n2.  **Implement Fallback Mechanism:** If the preferred LLM is unavailable, attempt to use a different, readily accessible model as a fallback (with appropriate logging).\n3.  **Introduce Computer Vision components:** Integrate an image analysis or computer vision model into the reasoning chain. This will allow the system to extract basic features (object locations, shapes, colors) from the grids that can then be used to build rules or serve as additional input to the LLM.\n4.  **Decompose Reasoning:** Break down the pattern recognition into smaller, more manageable steps. For example: identify individual object movements, color changes, or spatial transformations.\n5.  **Fine-tuning/Prompt Engineering:** Explore fine-tuning the LLM or using more effective prompt engineering techniques to improve its performance on visual pattern recognition tasks.\n6.  **Add Intermediate Output Logging:** Introduce detailed logging of intermediate reasoning steps, including information extracted from the input grids and the inferred transformation rules. This would greatly assist in debugging pattern recognition failures.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial failure (struggles to extract relevant visual features)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (cannot generate a valid output grid)\n    *   decision_making: Failure (cannot select the correct output grid)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial failure (struggles to extract relevant visual features)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (cannot generate a valid output grid)\n    *   decision_making: Failure (cannot select the correct output grid)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial failure (struggles to extract relevant visual features)\n    *   solution_generation: Failure (cannot generate a valid output grid)\n    *   decision_making: Failure (cannot select the correct output grid)\n",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\nHere's a comprehensive capability assessment based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly indicate a systemic failure to access the specified LLM (\"gemini-pro\"). The \"404\" error message repeats across all three samples, confirming that this is not an isolated incident but a consistent problem preventing the system from operating as intended. Despite correctly identifying the problem type and attempting the solving process, the system fails to provide any meaningful output due to this LLM unavailability. The recurring \"Could not determine the type of reasoning required\" message is a direct consequence of the LLM failure and likely a default response when the LLM is not functioning.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system's current capabilities are severely limited by the inability to connect to the intended LLM. While the system demonstrates an understanding of the problem-solving approach (abstract reasoning and visual pattern recognition), it's unable to execute this approach due to the API error. The system demonstrates potential for abstract reasoning when an LLM is available. Therefore, current reasoning capabilities are limited by infrastructure/access. The capability to understand the task is a strength, but execution capability is non-existent.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Understanding:** The system correctly identifies the required reasoning type (abstract reasoning and visual pattern recognition).\n*   **Intent to Follow Instructions:** The system attempts to follow the problem-solving instructions.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **LLM Dependency/Connectivity:** The system's dependence on a specific and potentially unavailable LLM model creates a critical point of failure.\n*   **Visual Pattern Recognition Skill Gap:** Even if the LLM issue is resolved, the system likely has weak capabilities in identifying and generalizing visual patterns. This is inferred from the error analysis highlighting the failure to determine the transformation rule.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most critical capability to focus on improving is **LLM Connectivity and Reliability**. Without a functional LLM, all other capabilities are rendered useless. Subsequently, if/when the LLM issue is resolved, the focus should shift to **Visual Pattern Recognition**.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n**Immediate Actions (To address LLM Connectivity):**\n\n1.  **API Key and Authentication Verification:** Thoroughly check all API keys, endpoint URLs, authentication methods, and associated permissions used to access the LLM. Verify that the correct model name (\"gemini-pro\") is being used and is accessible with the current API version. Ensure API keys have access privileges for the specific models.\n2.  **List Available Models:** Use the API's `ListModels` function (as suggested in the error message) to confirm the \"gemini-pro\" model is indeed available and that the system has the necessary permissions to use it. If it's unavailable, determine the correct model name and update the system's configuration.\n3.  **Fallback LLM Implementation:** Implement a fallback mechanism that automatically attempts to use a different, readily available LLM (e.g., a smaller or open-source model) if the primary LLM is unavailable. Log the use of the fallback model for monitoring purposes.\n4.  **Error Handling and User Feedback:** Improve error handling to provide more informative and user-friendly messages when an LLM connection fails. Instead of a generic message, explain the potential causes (API key issue, model unavailable, etc.) and suggest troubleshooting steps.\n\n**Subsequent Actions (To improve Visual Pattern Recognition):**\n\n5.  **Decompose Tasks:** Dissect the pattern recognition task into simpler sub-tasks, focusing on individual transformations like object movement, color changes, shape alterations, etc.\n6.  **Introduce Computer Vision (CV) Component:** Incorporate a dedicated computer vision module to pre-process the input grids and extract relevant features. This could include object detection, shape recognition, and color analysis. The extracted features can then be fed into the LLM to aid in reasoning.\n7.  **Prompt Engineering and Fine-tuning:** Experiment with different prompts and potentially fine-tune the LLM on a dataset of visual reasoning tasks similar to the \"Grid Transformation Task.\"\n8.  **Intermediate Output Logging:** Add detailed logging to capture the system's intermediate reasoning steps, including the extracted features and the inferred transformation rules. This will aid in debugging pattern recognition failures.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Declining** due to the persistent LLM connectivity issue. The system's theoretical capabilities are not being realized because of this fundamental flaw. If the LLM connectivity issue can be addressed, the trend can potentially shift to **Improving**, but only after addressing the visual pattern recognition skills gap.\n",

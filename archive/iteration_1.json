  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using an LLM to extract meeting details and preferences, and deterministic logic to generate and filter possible time slots. The `main` function orchestrates the process: `extract_meeting_info` uses an LLM to extract details, `generate_meeting_slots` creates possible slots, `filter_meeting_slots` removes invalid slots, and `select_best_meeting_slot` uses an LLM to choose the best one. Other functions are `parse_time`, and `call_llm`. The workflow is extracting info, generating slots, filtering slots and selecting the best slot.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error is:\n\n`TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`\n\nThis error consistently occurs on line 80 of `current_script_1.py` within the `generate_meeting_slots` function:\n\n`start_time = parse_time(meeting_info[\"work_hours\"][0])`\n\nThe error message indicates that `meeting_info[\"work_hours\"]` is evaluating to `None`. This means the code is expecting a list (or other subscriptable object) but is receiving `None` instead, likely because the \"work_hours\" key is missing in the `meeting_info` dictionary or its value is explicitly set to `None`. The error \"Error extracting meeting info: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" suggests that the `meeting_info` dictionary is either empty or not formatted as expected due to a parsing error. JSON parsing appears to be failing.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The code structure attempts to modularize the scheduling process into distinct functions (`generate_meeting_slots`, `parse_time`, `main`), which promotes readability and maintainability *if* the information extraction and parsing are successful.\n2.  The system anticipates the need to extract meeting information (participants, schedules, duration, work hours) as evidenced by the function `generate_meeting_slots`.\n3.  The system has a `main` function and an attempt to handle possible errors during the information extraction process.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Brittle Information Extraction:** The system's reliance on an unspecified method of extracting `meeting_info` is extremely fragile. The \"Error extracting meeting info: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" clearly indicates that the input question is not being parsed correctly, likely due to reliance on complex or incorrect regular expressions, or a failing LLM call that is returning a non-JSON response.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling in `main` and `generate_meeting_slots`:** While the `main` function catches an exception, the current implementation simply prints an error message and continues, leading to a `TypeError` later when the code tries to access non-existent data. The `generate_meeting_slots` function doesn't have any explicit error handling, which causes the program to crash when it encounters `None` values instead of valid lists.\n3.  **Inadequate Input Validation:** The system doesn't appear to validate whether the extracted `meeting_info` contains all the necessary keys (\"work_hours\", participants' schedules, etc.) before attempting to use them. This missing validation leads to the `TypeError` when the code expects `meeting_info[\"work_hours\"]` to be a list but finds `None` instead.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Failure:** The primary bottleneck is the failure to reliably extract structured `meeting_info` from the natural language input. All errors stem from this initial parsing failure. It is likely due to an LLM failing or returning the wrong format, or from brittle regex patterns.\n2.  **Missing Input Validation:** Lack of validation of `meeting_info` before use leads to the `TypeError` at line 80.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is that the `meeting_info` dictionary is not being populated correctly, leading to a `NoneType` error when the code attempts to access `meeting_info[\"work_hours\"][0]`. This suggests an issue with how the meeting information is being extracted from the input string. The consistent \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" message points to problems with JSON parsing, likely because the extraction process is failing to produce valid JSON.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **unreliable information extraction from the input question**. The system fails to consistently and accurately parse the natural language question into a structured `meeting_info` dictionary. The code then blindly attempts to access data in this dictionary, leading to runtime errors when the dictionary is incomplete or missing expected keys.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Robust Information Extraction:** The information extraction process needs to be made more robust, potentially by using LLMs for information extraction with improved prompting, error handling, and output validation, instead of relying on regex patterns which are prone to breaking with slight changes in the input format.\n2.  **Input Validation and Error Handling:** Add explicit checks to ensure that the `meeting_info` dictionary contains all necessary keys and that their values are of the expected type before attempting to use them. Include more comprehensive error handling in both `main` and `generate_meeting_slots` to gracefully handle missing or invalid data.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refactor Information Extraction with LLMs:** Replace the current parsing mechanism (likely regex) with an LLM-based approach. Use a clear prompt to instruct the LLM to extract specific fields (participants, blocked times, work hours, meeting duration) and format the output as a JSON object. Provide multiple examples in the prompt to guide the LLM.\n2.  **Implement JSON Validation:** After extracting `meeting_info`, use a schema validation library (e.g., `jsonschema`) to ensure that the extracted JSON object conforms to the expected schema. This will catch missing or malformed fields early on.\n3.  **Add Error Handling in `generate_meeting_slots`:** Wrap the code that accesses `meeting_info` in a `try...except` block. If a `KeyError` or `TypeError` occurs, log the error and return an empty list of possible slots or a default value.\n4.  **Validate `meeting_info` in `main`:** Before calling `generate_meeting_slots`, check if `meeting_info` is `None` or an empty dictionary. If so, log an error message and return an appropriate error response.\n5.  **Use a LLM for output verification.** The `hybrid_math_solver` example uses an LLM to verify steps of a problem and this could be ported to this use case.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nHere's a mapping of the failed capabilities for each sample:\n\n*   **Sample 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 1:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 3:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample 4:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification, decision\\_making\n\nAll samples fail in information extraction.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a capability assessment based on the provided information, focusing on actionable improvements.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show a \"TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable\" on line 80 of `current_script_1.py`. This is invariably preceded by \"Error extracting meeting info: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This pattern confirms the initial assessment: the root cause is a failure to extract valid JSON meeting information from the input question. The `main` function catches *an* exception during information extraction, but then proceeds to call `generate_meeting_slots` with a `None` value, which then crashes within `generate_meeting_slots`.  The fact that this happens for *every* sample indicates a complete failure of the information extraction component. This means that nothing else in the system gets a chance to work, making it impossible to evaluate other capabilities such as constraint handling, solution generation, etc.  The current error handling is inadequate, as it doesn't prevent the program from crashing after the initial extraction failure.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates almost *no* usable capability. While the *structure* of the code suggests an attempt to address the problem of scheduling meetings, the complete failure of the initial information extraction step renders all other components ineffective. The system's only *demonstrated* capability is printing an error message and traceback before crashing.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Modular Code Structure (Potential):** The division into functions like `generate_meeting_slots` and `parse_time` *could* be a strength, but it's currently irrelevant because the core information extraction is broken. This remains a potential strength to build upon once the parsing issues are addressed.\n*   **Attempt at Error Handling:** The `try...except` block in `main` shows an awareness of potential errors. However, the current implementation is insufficient.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Catastrophic Information Extraction Failure:** This is by far the most critical weakness. The system cannot reliably parse the input question.\n*   **Inadequate Error Handling:** The error handling is superficial. It catches an exception but doesn't prevent a subsequent crash. It does not properly handle null or empty responses from the information extraction.\n*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system doesn't validate that it has received valid `meeting_info` before proceeding to process it.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe *single* most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. Without reliable information extraction, nothing else can function.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Replace Regex with LLM for Information Extraction:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace the current method of extracting `meeting_info` (likely regex patterns) with an LLM call.\n    *   **Prompt Design:** Craft a detailed prompt that instructs the LLM to extract specific information (participants, work hours, meeting duration, existing commitments) and format the output as a JSON object.  Include multiple examples in the prompt demonstrating the desired input and output format.\n    *   **Example Prompt Snippet:** \"Extract the following information from the text: participants (list of names), work_hours (list of start and end times), meeting_duration (in minutes), existing_commitments (list of participants and their blocked time slots). Return the information as a JSON object.\"\n    *   **Few-Shot Learning:** Provide 3-5 diverse examples of questions and their corresponding JSON outputs in the prompt.  Vary the wording and complexity of the questions.\n    *   **Output Format:** Enforce a strict JSON schema in your prompt and include the word \"JSON\" prominently so that the LLM knows to output a JSON formatted response.\n\n2.  **Implement JSON Schema Validation:**\n    *   **Action:** After the LLM call, use the `jsonschema` library to validate the extracted JSON against a predefined schema.\n    *   **Schema Definition:** Define a schema that specifies the expected keys, data types, and any required fields.\n    *   **Example Schema (Snippet):**\n        ```json\n        {\n          \"type\": \"object\",\n          \"properties\": {\n            \"participants\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}},\n            \"work_hours\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}},\n            \"meeting_duration\": {\"type\": \"integer\"},\n            \"existing_commitments\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"object\"}}\n          },\n          \"required\": [\"participants\", \"work_hours\", \"meeting_duration\"]\n        }\n        ```\n    *   **Error Handling:** If the JSON doesn't validate against the schema, log a detailed error message and return an appropriate error response, preventing further processing.\n\n3.  **Enhance Error Handling and Validation in `main` and `generate_meeting_slots`:**\n    *   **Action:** Modify the `main` function to *check if `meeting_info` is valid and not None* after extraction. If it's invalid, log an error, and *return an appropriate error message to the user*. Do *not* call `generate_meeting_slots`.\n    *   **Action:** Add `try...except` blocks *within* `generate_meeting_slots` to handle potential `KeyError` or `TypeError` exceptions. If an error occurs, log the error and return a sensible default value (e.g., an empty list of available slots).\n    *   **Action:** After parsing the work hours in `generate_meeting_slots`, validate that the start time and end time are valid. If they are not, return a sensible default value.\n\n4.  **Implement LLM-Based Output Verification (Advanced):**\n    *   **Action:** After `generate_meeting_slots` produces a list of potential meeting slots, use an LLM to *verify* the proposed slots against the original input question and the extracted constraints.\n    *   **Prompt Design:**  Provide the LLM with the original question, the extracted `meeting_info`, and the proposed meeting slots. Ask it to assess whether the slots are valid given all constraints (e.g., participant availability, work hours, meeting duration).\n    *   **Feedback Loop:** If the LLM identifies invalid slots, log them and remove them from the final list.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current capability trend is **severely declining**. The system is completely non-functional due to the information extraction failure. The trend will remain negative until this core issue is addressed.\n",

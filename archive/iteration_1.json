  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by extracting meeting details with `extract_meeting_info`, generating time slots, filtering these slots against constraints with `filter_slots_by_constraints` using an LLM, and then selecting the best slot. The `extract_meeting_info` function extracts details like participants and duration by prompting the LLM to produce a JSON object. The `filter_slots_by_constraints` function then filters the time slots based on the constraints using the LLM. The `main` function orchestrates the entire process calling `extract_meeting_info`, `filter_slots_by_constraints`, and uses a loop with constraints for the filtering.",

This indicates that the system is attempting to parse an empty string or a string that does not contain valid JSON as a JSON object. This error occurs consistently in all attempts for each sample, suggesting a fundamental issue in generating or retrieving JSON data.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the limited information, it's difficult to identify clear strengths. However, we can infer potential areas:\n\n1.  **Problem Understanding:** The system seems to correctly identify the problem type as meeting scheduling, as indicated by the initial prompt instructions.\n2.  **Iterative Approach:** The system attempts the solution multiple times (3 attempts), indicating a degree of robustness.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The system fails to extract relevant meeting information (participants, schedules, constraints) from the problem description. This is evident from the consistent \"Error: Could not extract meeting information\" message.\n2.  **JSON Handling:** The system consistently fails to generate or correctly format JSON output, leading to the `JSONDecodeError`.\n3. **Lack of Error Handling:** While attempts are made to re-run, the system doesn't adapt to the initial JSON decoding error and retries the same flawed approach.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Failure:** The inability to reliably extract meeting details from the text is the primary bottleneck. If the system cannot understand the input, it cannot generate a valid solution.\n2.  **JSON Output Generation:** The consistent `JSONDecodeError` indicates a fundamental issue in how the system constructs or retrieves the JSON it attempts to parse.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is a complete failure to extract information, followed by a `JSONDecodeError`. This suggests that the information extraction component either fails completely or returns an empty string, which is then passed to a JSON parser, resulting in the `JSONDecodeError`. The consistent repetition of this error across multiple attempts indicates the lack of adaptive error handling or fallback mechanisms.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **failure of the information extraction component to reliably extract the required details (participants, schedules, constraints) from the input text**. This failure leads to an empty or invalid string being passed to the subsequent JSON parsing step, causing the `JSONDecodeError`.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the robustness and accuracy of the information extraction component, possibly by using more sophisticated LLM prompting techniques, few-shot learning, or hybrid LLM-code approaches. Focus on identifying and extracting key entities (participants, time constraints, preferences).\n2.  **JSON Handling:** Ensure the system generates valid JSON output. Implement robust error handling to catch cases where JSON generation fails, and provide meaningful error messages or fallback mechanisms. Implement schema validation.\n3. **Adaptive Error Handling:** Implement more adaptive error handling. If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, the system should not simply retry the same extraction process but should attempt a different extraction strategy or provide a more informative error message to the user.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Information Extraction:**\n    *   Use a chain-of-thought approach for information extraction, breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps.\n    *   Implement a verification step to check the extracted information for completeness and consistency before proceeding.\n    *   Fine-tune the LLM prompts for information extraction with more specific examples and instructions.\n    *   Consider using a hybrid LLM-code approach, where the LLM extracts the information, and deterministic code validates and corrects the extraction.\n2.  **Robust JSON Handling:**\n    *   Use a try-except block around the JSON parsing code to catch `JSONDecodeError` exceptions.\n    *   Before attempting to parse the JSON, check if the string is empty or contains valid JSON.\n    *   If JSON parsing fails, log the error and the problematic string for debugging purposes.\n    *   Implement a fallback mechanism, such as returning a default JSON object or prompting the user for the missing information.\n3.  **Adaptive Error Handling:**\n    *   Implement a retry mechanism with a backoff strategy, where the system waits for an increasing amount of time before retrying.\n    *   If the information extraction fails multiple times, use a different extraction strategy, such as simplifying the prompt or focusing on specific entities.\n    *   If the error persists, provide a user-friendly error message with instructions on how to resolve the issue.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n| Sample ID | Failed Capabilities                                     |\n| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |\n| 0         | information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation        |\n| 1         | information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation        |\n| 2         | information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation        |\n| 3         | information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation        |\n| 4         | information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation        |\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided information, following your specified structure and focusing on actionable improvements.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show a `JSONDecodeError` occurring on all three attempts for each sample. The error message, \"Error: Could not extract meeting information,\" suggests that the code attempts to parse the output of the information extraction component as JSON, but that component is returning an empty string or a non-JSON string. The repetitive nature of this error across all samples and attempts clearly points to a fundamental flaw in the information extraction and/or JSON generation process. It also shows a lack of any effective error recovery mechanism.  The fact that the error message is identical across all samples suggests the information extraction is failing in the same way consistently.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system currently demonstrates extremely limited capabilities. While it seems to recognize the problem domain (meeting scheduling), it utterly fails to extract the necessary information and generate a valid solution. The core functionality is broken. The system shows signs of a basic iterative approach, but the lack of adaptive error handling renders it ineffective.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Problem Recognition (Potential):** The system *may* correctly identify the problem as meeting scheduling. (This is only inferred from the error message and the prompt.)\n*   **Iterative Attempt:** The system attempts to solve the problem multiple times. (But this is useless without adaptive error handling.)\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Information Extraction:**  Completely and consistently fails to extract meeting details from input text. This is the root cause of all other problems.\n*   **JSON Generation/Handling:**  Unable to generate or process valid JSON, leading to a consistent `JSONDecodeError`.\n*   **Adaptive Error Handling:**  Lacks the ability to adjust its approach or recover from errors like the `JSONDecodeError`.  It simply retries the same failing process.\n*   **Accuracy:** No correct answer has been generated.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe **single most important capability to focus on improving is Information Extraction.**  Until the system can reliably extract key details from the input text, it cannot perform any other function.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, prioritized and focusing on the Information Extraction bottleneck:\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust Information Extraction Module:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace whatever current method is being used (likely brittle regex) with an LLM-centric approach. Create a function, `extract_meeting_info(text)`, that uses the LLM to extract participants, time constraints, and other relevant information. Use Chain-of-Thought prompting to guide the LLM.\n    *   **Code Example (Illustrative):**\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_info(text):\n            extraction_prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are an expert meeting scheduler. Extract the following information from the text:\n\n            1.  Participants (names of people involved)\n            2.  Possible meeting times (dates and times)\n            3.  Any constraints or preferences mentioned\n\n            Text: {text}\n\n            Return the information as a JSON object with these keys: \"participants\", \"meeting_times\", \"constraints\".  If any information is missing, use \"unknown\" as the value.\n            \"\"\"\n            json_output = call_llm(extraction_prompt) # call_llm is placeholder for how you interface to LLM.\n            try:\n                meeting_info = json.loads(json_output)\n                return meeting_info\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                print(\"JSON Decode Error!\")\n                return {\"participants\": \"unknown\", \"meeting_times\": \"unknown\", \"constraints\": \"unknown\"}\n        ```\n\n2.  **Verify Extracted Information:**\n    *   **Action:**  After extracting information, add a validation step to check the extracted data. Use the LLM to do the checking. If the information is incomplete or nonsensical, flag it and attempt to re-extract with a more specific prompt.\n    *   **Code Example (Illustrative):**\n        ```python\n        def validate_meeting_info(meeting_info, original_text):\n            validation_prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are validating meeting information extracted from text.  Here's the original text: {original_text}.  Here's the extracted information: {meeting_info}.\n\n            Is the extracted information complete and reasonable, given the original text?  Specifically:\n            1.  Are the participants valid names?\n            2.  Do the meeting times make sense in context?\n            3.  Are the constraints accurately reflected?\n\n            Respond with \"VALID\" if everything is correct.  Otherwise, respond with \"INVALID: [reason for invalidity]\".\n            \"\"\"\n            validation_result = call_llm(validation_prompt)\n            if \"INVALID\" in validation_result:\n                return False, validation_result.split(\"INVALID: \")[1]\n            else:\n                return True, \"\"\n        ```\n\n3.  **Implement Adaptive Error Handling for JSONDecodeError:**\n    *   **Action:** Wrap the `json.loads()` call in a `try...except` block. If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, *do not* simply retry the same extraction process. Instead:\n        *   Log the error.\n        *   Call the LLM with a *different* prompt to debug the JSON output. For example, \"You must provide valid JSON only!\"\n        *   Return a *default*, valid JSON object (e.g., `{\"error\": \"Could not extract information\"}`) to prevent the program from crashing.\n    *   **Code Example (Illustrative):**\n        ```python\n        try:\n            data = json.loads(llm_response)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n            print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n\n            # LLM-Driven Debug\n            debug_prompt = f\"The following JSON could not be decoded: {llm_response}. You MUST provide ONLY valid JSON. Correct the JSON\"\n            llm_response = call_llm(debug_prompt)\n\n            # Attempt to parse again, or return default\n            try:\n                data = json.loads(llm_response)\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                 data = {\"error\": \"Could not extract information\"}\n        ```\n\n4. **Add Few-Shot Examples to the Information Extraction Prompt:**\n    *   **Action:** Include 2-3 example extractions in your prompt to the LLM to guide its behavior.  Show examples of different meeting scheduling scenarios and the corresponding JSON output.\n5.  **Remove any regex parsing:** Replace any use of regex parsing with LLM reasoning and parsing.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, capabilities are **Stable (Negative)**. The system consistently fails, and there's no indication of improvement. With the recommended actions (especially fixing information extraction and robust JSON handling), the trend should shift to **Improving** in the next iteration.\n",

If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, the system should not simply retry the same extraction process but should attempt a different extraction strategy or provide a more informative error message to the user.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Information Extraction:**\n    *   Use a chain-of-thought approach for information extraction, breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps.\n    *   Implement a verification step to check the extracted information for completeness and consistency before proceeding.\n    *   Fine-tune the LLM prompts for information extraction with more specific examples and instructions.\n    *   Consider using a hybrid LLM-code approach, where the LLM extracts the information, and deterministic code validates and corrects the extraction.\n2.  **Robust JSON Handling:**\n    *   Use a try-except block around the JSON parsing code to catch `JSONDecodeError` exceptions.\n    *   Before attempting to parse the JSON, check if the string is empty or contains valid JSON.\n    *   If JSON parsing fails, log the error and the problematic string for debugging purposes.\n    *   Implement a fallback mechanism, such as returning a default JSON object or prompting the user for the missing information.\n3.  **Adaptive Error Handling:**\n    *   Implement a retry mechanism with a backoff strategy, where the system waits for an increasing amount of time before retrying.\n    *   If the information extraction fails multiple times, use a different extraction strategy, such as simplifying the prompt or focusing on specific entities.\n    *   If the error persists, provide a user-friendly error message with instructions on how to resolve the issue.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n| Sample ID | Failed Capabilities                                     |\n| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |\n| 0         | information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation        |\n| 1         | information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation        |\n| 2         | information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation        |\n| 3         | information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation        |\n| 4         | information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation        |\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided information, following your specified structure and focusing on actionable improvements.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show a `JSONDecodeError` occurring on all three attempts for each sample. The error message, \"Error: Could not extract meeting information,\" suggests that the code attempts to parse the output of the information extraction component as JSON, but that component is returning an empty string or a non-JSON string. The repetitive nature of this error across all samples and attempts clearly points to a fundamental flaw in the information extraction and/or JSON generation process. It also shows a lack of any effective error recovery mechanism.  The fact that the error message is identical across all samples suggests the information extraction is failing in the same way consistently.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system currently demonstrates extremely limited capabilities. While it seems to recognize the problem domain (meeting scheduling), it utterly fails to extract the necessary information and generate a valid solution. The core functionality is broken. The system shows signs of a basic iterative approach, but the lack of adaptive error handling renders it ineffective.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Problem Recognition (Potential):** The system *may* correctly identify the problem as meeting scheduling. (This is only inferred from the error message and the prompt.)\n*   **Iterative Attempt:** The system attempts to solve the problem multiple times. (But this is useless without adaptive error handling.)\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Information Extraction:**  Completely and consistently fails to extract meeting details from input text. This is the root cause of all other problems.\n*   **JSON Generation/Handling:**  Unable to generate or process valid JSON, leading to a consistent `JSONDecodeError`.\n*   **Adaptive Error Handling:**  Lacks the ability to adjust its approach or recover from errors like the `JSONDecodeError`.  It simply retries the same failing process.\n*   **Accuracy:** No correct answer has been generated.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe **single most important capability to focus on improving is Information Extraction.**  Until the system can reliably extract key details from the input text, it cannot perform any other function.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, prioritized and focusing on the Information Extraction bottleneck:\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust Information Extraction Module:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace whatever current method is being used (likely brittle regex) with an LLM-centric approach. Create a function, `extract_meeting_info(text)`, that uses the LLM to extract participants, time constraints, and other relevant information. Use Chain-of-Thought prompting to guide the LLM.\n    *   **Code Example (Illustrative):**\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_info(text):\n            extraction_prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are an expert meeting scheduler. Extract the following information from the text:\n\n            1.  Participants (names of people involved)\n            2.  Possible meeting times (dates and times)\n            3.  Any constraints or preferences mentioned\n\n            Text: {text}\n\n            Return the information as a JSON object with these keys: \"participants\", \"meeting_times\", \"constraints\".  If any information is missing, use \"unknown\" as the value.\n            \"\"\"\n            json_output = call_llm(extraction_prompt) # call_llm is placeholder for how you interface to LLM.\n            try:\n                meeting_info = json.loads(json_output)\n                return meeting_info\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                print(\"JSON Decode Error!\")\n                return {\"participants\": \"unknown\", \"meeting_times\": \"unknown\", \"constraints\": \"unknown\"}\n        ```\n\n2.  **Verify Extracted Information:**\n    *   **Action:**  After extracting information, add a validation step to check the extracted data. Use the LLM to do the checking. If the information is incomplete or nonsensical, flag it and attempt to re-extract with a more specific prompt.\n    *   **Code Example (Illustrative):**\n        ```python\n        def validate_meeting_info(meeting_info, original_text):\n            validation_prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are validating meeting information extracted from text.  Here's the original text: {original_text}.  Here's the extracted information: {meeting_info}.\n\n            Is the extracted information complete and reasonable, given the original text?  Specifically:\n            1.  Are the participants valid names?\n            2.  Do the meeting times make sense in context?\n            3.  Are the constraints accurately reflected?\n\n            Respond with \"VALID\" if everything is correct.  Otherwise, respond with \"INVALID: [reason for invalidity]\".\n            \"\"\"\n            validation_result = call_llm(validation_prompt)\n            if \"INVALID\" in validation_result:\n                return False, validation_result.split(\"INVALID: \")[1]\n            else:\n                return True, \"\"\n        ```\n\n3.  **Implement Adaptive Error Handling for JSONDecodeError:**\n    *   **Action:** Wrap the `json.loads()` call in a `try...except` block. If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, *do not* simply retry the same extraction process. Instead:\n        *   Log the error.\n        *   Call the LLM with a *different* prompt to debug the JSON output. For example, \"You must provide valid JSON only!\"\n        *   Return a *default*, valid JSON object (e.g., `{\"error\": \"Could not extract information\"}`) to prevent the program from crashing.\n    *   **Code Example (Illustrative):**\n        ```python\n        try:\n            data = json.loads(llm_response)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n            print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n\n            # LLM-Driven Debug\n            debug_prompt = f\"The following JSON could not be decoded: {llm_response}. You MUST provide ONLY valid JSON. Correct the JSON\"\n            llm_response = call_llm(debug_prompt)\n\n            # Attempt to parse again, or return default\n            try:\n                data = json.loads(llm_response)\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                 data = {\"error\": \"Could not extract information\"}\n        ```\n\n4. **Add Few-Shot Examples to the Information Extraction Prompt:**\n    *   **Action:** Include 2-3 example extractions in your prompt to the LLM to guide its behavior.  Show examples of different meeting scheduling scenarios and the corresponding JSON output.\n5.  **Remove any regex parsing:** Replace any use of regex parsing with LLM reasoning and parsing.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, capabilities are **Stable (Negative)**. The system consistently fails, and there's no indication of improvement. With the recommended actions (especially fixing information extraction and robust JSON handling), the trend should shift to **Improving** in the next iteration.\n"

This approach tests whether a more structured reasoning process reduces errors compared to a direct, single-step solution.

Use these keywords to simplify the passage,\n    focusing on the most relevant sentences.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Question: Which player kicked the only field goal of the game?\n    Passage: Game SummaryComing off their Thanksgiving road win over the Falcons, the Colts went home for a Week 13 AFC South rematch with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.  In the second quarter, the Jaguars got on the board with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Colts replied with Manning and Clark hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, Jacksonville tried to come back as QB David Garrard completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Mercedes Lewis for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with Manning completing a 1-yard TD pass to RB Luke Lawton. Afterwards, Jacksonville tried to come back as Garrard completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt (along with getting the 2-point conversion run). Indianapolis' defense managed to seal the deal. With their season-sweep over the Jaguars, the Colts improved to 10-2. During the game, the Colts gave Garrard his first interception of the year, courtesy of Safety Antoine Bethea.\n\n    Keywords: player, field goal\n    Simplified Passage: In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal.\n\n    Example 2:\n    Question: Which star has a smaller mass, Nu Phoenicis or Gliese 915?\n    Passage: Nu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 \u00b1 0.01 (2.45 \u00b7 108) centimetre\u00b7second\u22122, or approximately 250,000 of Earths gravity.\n\n    Keywords: star, mass, Nu Phoenicis, Gliese 915\n    Simplified Passage: Nu Phoenicis is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun.

  "approach_summary": "The script implements a multi-stage LLM-driven approach to answer a question based on a given passage. It decomposes the problem into keyword identification and passage simplification, information extraction, and answer verification stages. Three LLM agent roles are employed: a passage simplifier, an information extraction expert, and an answer checker. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini model. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow: `call_llm` is used to extract keywords and simplify the passage, then used to extract the answer, and finally used again to verify the extracted answer's correctness.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West divisional rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212; from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome. Peyton Manning finished the day with the first 0.0 passer rating of his career.\n\nQUESTION: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown pass than the longest field goal?",

In recent years, the economy has suffered because of depressed international demand for nickel, due to the ongoing financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. Only a negligible amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports.

The errors, based on the error analysis report, aren't directly visible in these snippets, but we can infer the following:\n\n*   **Error Case (Inferred):** The output \"32 yards\" likely represents the incorrect answer to the subtraction problem (longest touchdown - longest field goal). This corroborates the \"Off-by-small-margin Numerical Errors\" observation in the error analysis. The proximity of 32 to the correct answer of 30 strongly suggests an issue with identifying the correct numbers *before* the subtraction occurs.\n*   **Success Cases:** The other two outputs (\"100\" and \"Canada\") indicate the system can correctly identify and extract specific pieces of information when the context is clear.\n*   **Output Format:** The consistent output format is a positive attribute, making post-processing and automated evaluation easier.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a moderate level of capability. It can perform basic information extraction and handle simple reasoning tasks in straightforward scenarios. However, it struggles when faced with complex contexts requiring precise numerical identification and arithmetic operations. Contextual understanding is a significant limiting factor.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Numerical Information Extraction:** The system can extract numbers from the text.\n*   **Simple Reasoning:** The system can handle comparison-based questions.\n*   **Consistent Output Format:** The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` delimiters improve parsability.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Arithmetic Errors:** Inaccurate calculations due to incorrect initial values.\n*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** Difficulty identifying relevant information when multiple similar data points exist.\n*   **Precise Information Extraction:** Struggles to select the *correct* numerical values based on context.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary focus should be on **improving precise information extraction with enhanced contextual understanding.** Addressing this will have the most significant impact on overall accuracy, as the arithmetic errors stem from incorrect initial values.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Contextual Filtering for Numerical Extraction:**\n    *   When a question involves numerical operations, implement a filtering stage after initial numerical extraction.\n    *   This stage should use keywords and contextual information from the question to narrow down the extracted numbers to the most relevant ones.\n    *   For the error case scenario (longest TD - longest FG), filter the numbers based on the phrases \"touchdown pass\" and \"field goal\" respectively, and *then* select the maximum from each filtered list.\n2.  **Add Detailed Logging of Extraction Rationale:**\n    *   Log *why* the system selected specific numerical values.\n    *   Include the contextual keywords used, the filtering steps applied, and the reasoning behind choosing a particular value as the \"longest\" or \"shortest\".\n    *   This detailed logging is critical for debugging future errors and understanding the system's decision-making process.\n3. **Implement Input Validation:**\n    *   Prior to any extraction and arithmetic steps, validate the input question by checking if the type of question can be answered and if the input contains the information.\n    *   If the input validation fails, return an error.\n4.  **Unit Tests for Information Extraction:**\n    * Create unit tests specifically focused on the information extraction module.\n    * Design tests to cover edge cases, ambiguous language, and scenarios with multiple similar values.\n    * Track the accuracy of the information extraction module independently to assess the impact of improvements.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current data, it's difficult to assess a trend. However, the clear weaknesses indicate a need for improvement. After implementing the recommendations and retraining, the trend should be monitored to determine if capabilities are improving. More data points after retraining are critical to determine the direction of capability change.\n",

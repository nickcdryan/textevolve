  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-based techniques with agent roles for information extraction, search query generation, answer extraction, and answer validation to answer questions. It decomposes the problem into extracting information, generating a search query, simulating search results using the LLM, extracting the answer, and validating the answer. The functions used are `call_llm`, `extract_information`, `generate_search_query`, `extract_answer`, `validate_answer`, and `main`. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling the functions sequentially, starting with information extraction and ending with answer validation, using the output of one function as input to the next.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no visible runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) in the provided outputs.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system is generally capable of extracting relevant entities and constraints from the question. This is evidenced by the \"Extracted Info\" sections in both error and success cases.\n*   **Search Query Generation:** The system generates reasonable search queries based on the extracted information. For example, in Sample ID 1, the query `\"Monsieur Mallah death before New 52\"` is relevant to the question.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inability to Handle Conflicting Information:** The system struggles when search results present conflicting information or require nuanced interpretation. In Sample ID 1, the search results mention Mallah's apparent death and subsequent return, leading the system to conclude \"Unknown from search result\" instead of identifying the murderer.\n*   **Incorrect Answer Extraction:** The system can sometimes extract and validate incorrect answers, even when a different correct answer is available. This is evident in Sample ID 2, where the system incorrectly identifies Dr. Sheikh Jalal as the first cardiologist in Kashmir.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Lack of Reasoning/Inference Over Search Results:** The system relies heavily on the first piece of information it finds and doesn't reason through multiple potentially conflicting results. It needs a more sophisticated mechanism to synthesize information and resolve discrepancies.\n*   **Validation Rigidity:** The validation process seems overly reliant on the system's *own* extraction. If the system extracts an incorrect answer, it validates that incorrect answer, instead of comparing against ground truth data.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Reliance on Keyword Matching:** The system seems to rely heavily on keyword matching in search results and answer extraction. This can lead to incorrect answers if the keywords are present but the context is misleading (e.g., Sample ID 2).\n*   **Insufficient Verification of Answer:** The system sometimes incorrectly validates answers due to poor validation criteria and/or a lack of external knowledge to verify answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's **lack of robust reasoning and inference capabilities when processing search results**. It needs to be able to synthesize information from multiple sources, resolve conflicts, and verify answers against a broader knowledge base or logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Search Result Processing:** Develop more sophisticated techniques for analyzing and synthesizing information from multiple search results. This should involve identifying and resolving conflicting information, assessing the credibility of sources, and extracting relevant information based on context.\n*   **Answer Validation:** Improve the answer validation process to include external knowledge and verification steps. This could involve cross-referencing the extracted answer with other sources, applying logical reasoning, and checking for inconsistencies.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement a multi-stage search and reasoning process:**\n    1.  **Initial Search:** Generate the initial search query as before.\n    2.  **Result Summarization:** Summarize each search result individually. This could involve identifying key entities, relationships, and claims made in the document.\n    3.  **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a mechanism to identify and resolve conflicting information across different search results. This could involve assigning weights to different sources based on their credibility or using logical reasoning to determine the most likely answer.\n    4.  **Answer Synthesis:** Synthesize the information from different search results to generate a final answer. This should involve combining the evidence from multiple sources and providing a confidence score for the answer.\n    5.  **External Verification:** Before validation, run a second search query based on the proposed answer to verify it against other sources.\n\n*   **Implement a more comprehensive validation module:**\n    *   Add external knowledge bases (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia) to verify answers.\n    *   Use a question-answering model to independently verify the extracted answer based on the search results.\n    *   Implement a \"sanity check\" module to identify obviously incorrect or illogical answers.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed. The system was unable to generate the correct answer (\"Gorilla Grodd\") from the conflicting information in the search results.\n    *   decision_making: Failed. The system decided the answer was \"unknown\" instead of inferring the most likely answer based on the available evidence.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed. The system generated an incorrect answer (\"Dr. Sheikh Jalal\").\n    *   solution_verification: Failed. The system incorrectly validated the incorrect answer.\n",

The system incorrectly identifies the answer as \"Unknown\" rather than resolving the conflict and inferring the correct answer. Validation flags this as INVALID, as it should, because the system does not return a valid answer.\n*   **Sample 3 (Incorrect):** This sample is particularly concerning. The system extracts an incorrect answer from the search results (\"Dr. Sheikh Jalal\") and then *validates* that incorrect answer as correct. This indicates a flaw in the validation process, as it's not cross-referencing against a reliable source or applying logic to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Pattern Observation:** The primary failure mode involves the system's inability to reason through search results, resolve conflicts, and implement a robust validation mechanism. The system is too reliant on the *first* seemingly relevant piece of information.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic information extraction and search query generation capabilities. However, its reasoning, inference, and validation abilities are severely lacking, leading to frequent errors when dealing with complex or ambiguous information. The validation module's reliance on the system's own (sometimes incorrect) extraction is a critical flaw.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system consistently extracts relevant entities and constraints from the questions.\n*   **Search Query Generation:** The system generates reasonable and relevant search queries based on the extracted information.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Reasoning and Inference:** The system struggles to synthesize information from multiple sources, resolve conflicting information, and infer the correct answer.\n*   **Answer Validation:** The answer validation process is flawed, often validating incorrect answers or failing to verify answers against external knowledge.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Keyword Matching:** The system exhibits an over-reliance on keyword matching in search results, leading to errors when the context is misleading.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **reasoning and inference over search results**. Addressing this weakness will have the biggest impact on overall accuracy.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Stage Search and Reasoning Process:** Adopt the suggested multi-stage approach that involves result summarization, conflict resolution, answer synthesis, and external verification. Focus on implementing conflict resolution first. This will allow you to handle more complex search results that provide conflicting results.\n\n2.  **Improve Answer Validation with External Knowledge:** Integrate an external knowledge base (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia) into the answer validation process. When an answer is extracted, query the knowledge base to verify its accuracy and relevance. If there is an alternate answer in the knowledge base with a high degree of confidence, flag the validation as potentially incorrect. Start with Wikidata since it has a robust API and data structure.\n\n3.  **Refine Validation Logic:** Decouple validation from the initial answer extraction. Instead of validating the extracted answer directly, the validation module should re-analyze the search results independently and attempt to derive the correct answer. This \"independent verification\" approach will help catch errors made during the initial extraction phase. Prioritize the use of a Question-Answering model in the validation process to provide independent verification.\n\n4.  **Introduce Contextual Understanding:** Enhance the system's ability to understand the context of search results. Implement techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction to identify relationships between entities and understand the overall meaning of the text.\n\n5.  **Address Keyword Matching Issue:** Implement techniques to reduce reliance on keyword matching. Use semantic search techniques that consider the meaning of the text rather than just the presence of keywords. This may require incorporating pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are currently **stable but inadequate**. The system needs significant improvements in reasoning and validation to achieve acceptable accuracy. Implementing the actionable recommendations above should lead to a positive capability trend in the next iteration.\n",

It needs a more sophisticated mechanism to synthesize information and resolve discrepancies.\n*   **Validation Rigidity:** The validation process seems overly reliant on the system's *own* extraction. If the system extracts an incorrect answer, it validates that incorrect answer, instead of comparing against ground truth data.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Reliance on Keyword Matching:** The system seems to rely heavily on keyword matching in search results and answer extraction. This can lead to incorrect answers if the keywords are present but the context is misleading (e.g., Sample ID 2).\n*   **Insufficient Verification of Answer:** The system sometimes incorrectly validates answers due to poor validation criteria and/or a lack of external knowledge to verify answers.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's **lack of robust reasoning and inference capabilities when processing search results**. It needs to be able to synthesize information from multiple sources, resolve conflicts, and verify answers against a broader knowledge base or logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Search Result Processing:** Develop more sophisticated techniques for analyzing and synthesizing information from multiple search results. This should involve identifying and resolving conflicting information, assessing the credibility of sources, and extracting relevant information based on context.\n*   **Answer Validation:** Improve the answer validation process to include external knowledge and verification steps. This could involve cross-referencing the extracted answer with other sources, applying logical reasoning, and checking for inconsistencies.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement a multi-stage search and reasoning process:**\n    1.  **Initial Search:** Generate the initial search query as before.\n    2.  **Result Summarization:** Summarize each search result individually. This could involve identifying key entities, relationships, and claims made in the document.\n    3.  **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a mechanism to identify and resolve conflicting information across different search results. This could involve assigning weights to different sources based on their credibility or using logical reasoning to determine the most likely answer.\n    4.  **Answer Synthesis:** Synthesize the information from different search results to generate a final answer. This should involve combining the evidence from multiple sources and providing a confidence score for the answer.\n    5.  **External Verification:** Before validation, run a second search query based on the proposed answer to verify it against other sources.\n\n*   **Implement a more comprehensive validation module:**\n    *   Add external knowledge bases (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia) to verify answers.\n    *   Use a question-answering model to independently verify the extracted answer based on the search results.\n    *   Implement a \"sanity check\" module to identify obviously incorrect or illogical answers.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.

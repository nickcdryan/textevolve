  "approach_summary": "This script solves scheduling problems using a multi-agent approach with LLMs, where specialized agents decompose the problem, extract constraints, generate potential solutions, and verify solution validity. The workflow involves sequentially calling these agents to process the input problem and arrive at a proposed meeting time. The entire process relies heavily on LLM calls, using them for all complex reasoning and understanding tasks.",

To effectively generate a possible meeting time, I need the following information, mirroring the representation of constraints you've outlined:\n\n1.  **Participants' Schedules:** A dictionary where keys are participant names (strings) and values are lists of blocked time intervals (tuples of integers representing minutes from midnight).  Example:\n\n    ```python\n    schedules = {\n        \"Alice\": [(540, 600), (720, 780)],  # Alice busy from 9:00-10:00 and 12:00-13:00\n        \"Bob\": [(660, 720), (840, 900)],    # Bob busy from 11:00-12:00 and 14:00-15:00\n        \"Charlie\": [(480, 540)]            # Charlie busy from 8:00-9:00\n    }\n    ```\n\n2.  **Meeting Duration:** An integer representing the meeting duration in minutes.

        "system_answer": "Here is the proposed time: Okay, I understand. To effectively generate a possible meeting time, I need the following information, mirroring the representation of constraints you've outlined:\n\n1.  **Participants' Schedules:** A dictionary where keys are participant names (strings) and values are lists of blocked time intervals (tuples of integers representing minutes from midnight).  Example:\n\n    ```python\n    schedules = {\n        \"Alice\": [(540, 600), (720, 780)],  # Alice busy from 9:00-10:00 and 12:00-13:00\n        \"Bob\": [(660, 720), (840, 900)],    # Bob busy from 11:00-12:00 and 14:00-15:00\n        \"Charlie\": [(480, 540)]            # Charlie busy from 8:00-9:00\n    }\n    ```\n\n2.  **Meeting Duration:** An integer representing the meeting duration in minutes. Example:\n\n    ```python\n    duration = 30\n    ```\n\n3.  **Working Hours:** A tuple of integers representing the start and end of working hours in minutes from midnight. Example:\n\n    ```python\n    working_hours = (540, 1020)  # 9:00 to 17:00\n    ```\n\n4.  **Preferred Time (Optional):** A tuple of integers representing the preferred start and end time for the meeting in minutes from midnight. If no preference, this can be set to the same as `working_hours`, or even `None`. Example:\n\n    ```python\n    preferred_time = (540, 720) #Preferably 9:00 to 12:00\n    ```\n\n5.  **Specific Day (Optional):**  While not directly represented as a single variable, the provided schedules *implicitly* represent the availability for a specific day.\n\nOnce I have this information, I can implement an algorithm to:\n\n1.  **Generate Potential Time Slots:** Iterate through possible start times within `working_hours`, considering the `duration` and a reasonable granularity (e.g., 1 minute or 5-minute intervals).\n\n2.  **Check for Conflicts:** For each potential time slot, check if it conflicts with any participant's blocked time intervals.  A conflict exists if `slot` to `slot + duration` overlaps with any interval in `schedules`.\n\n3.  **Honor Preferred Time (if applicable):** Prioritize time slots within the `preferred_time` range.\n\n4.  **Return a Valid Slot:** If a conflict-free slot is found within the `working_hours` (and ideally within `preferred_time`), return it.  If no such slot exists, indicate that no suitable time could be found.\n\n**Example Implementation (Python):**\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time(schedules, duration, working_hours, preferred_time=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a suitable meeting time given participant schedules, duration, and working hours.\n\n    Args:\n        schedules (dict): Dictionary of participant schedules (see example above).\n        duration (int): Meeting duration in minutes.\n        working_hours (tuple): Tuple of (start, end) working hours in minutes from midnight.\n        preferred_time (tuple, optional): Tuple of (start, end) preferred time in minutes from midnight. Defaults to None.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: Start time of the meeting in minutes from midnight, or None if no suitable time is found.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if preferred_time is None:\n        preferred_time = working_hours # Default to working hours if no preference\n\n    participants = schedules.keys()\n    start_working, end_working = working_hours\n\n    for slot in range(start_working, end_working - duration + 1):\n        # Check if slot falls in preferred time window.\n        if slot + duration <= preferred_time[1] and slot >= preferred_time[0]: # Addressed implicit constraints that finish time must fall within working hours/preferred time.\n\n            is_available = True\n            for person in participants:\n                for busy_start, busy_end in schedules[person]:\n                    if slot < busy_end and slot + duration > busy_start:\n                        is_available = False\n                        break\n                if not is_available:\n                    break\n\n            if is_available:\n                return slot\n\n    return None  # No suitable time found\n```\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n```python\nschedules = {\n    \"Alice\": [(540, 600), (720, 780)],\n    \"Bob\": [(660, 720), (840, 900)],\n    \"Charlie\": [(480, 540)]\n}\nduration = 30\nworking_hours = (540, 1020)\npreferred_time = (540, 720)\n\nmeeting_time = find_meeting_time(schedules, duration, working_hours, preferred_time)\n\nif meeting_time:\n    print(f\"Meeting can be scheduled at {meeting_time // 60:02}:{meeting_time % 60:02}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No suitable meeting time found.\")\n\n# Output: Meeting can be scheduled at 10:00  (600 minutes from midnight)\n```\n\nTo give you a specific meeting time, please provide the schedule data.",

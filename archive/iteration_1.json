      "text_report": "## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Availability Analysis:** The system attempts to break down the availability of each participant, which is a logical approach to the problem.\n*   **Constraint Consideration:** The system explicitly considers the time constraints (9:00-17:00) and preferences of participants.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Calculation:** The system incorrectly calculates the available time slots for participants, leading to incorrect conclusions about the earliest available time.\n*   **Lack of Holistic Schedule Assessment:** The system seems to evaluate time slots individually without ensuring that a single, continuous 30-minute slot is available for all participants.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Incorrect Availability Interval Calculation:** The core bottleneck is the inaccurate calculation of available time intervals for each participant based on their existing schedules. If this initial step is flawed, the entire process is compromised.\n*   **Lack of Atomic Slot Verification:** The system fails to verify if there is a complete block of 30 minutes available for all participants together.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Consistent Miscalculation of Available Time:** Across multiple error cases, the system derives incorrect free time intervals for participants, which leads to the selection of wrong meeting times. This implies an error in the logic that processes schedule constraints.\n*   **Suboptimal Solution Choice:** Even when the system identifies a potentially valid time slot, it fails to select the correct one according to the golden answer. This suggests a flaw in comparing and ranking potential solutions.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is an **incorrect implementation of the logic for determining available time slots for each participant**, given their existing schedule. This logic appears to be flawed, resulting in the system identifying incorrect free time intervals. Specifically, it's failing to properly account for meeting durations and blocked calendar events when generating the availability ranges.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system needs improvement in extracting the blocked calendar events and time slots from the problem description with greater precision.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Enhance constraint handling to accurately determine available time intervals based on blocked events and meeting durations.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Improve solution verification to ensure that the selected time slot satisfies constraints for all participants, providing a single continuous block of time.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Interval Calculation Logic:** Implement a more robust and accurate function for calculating free time intervals. This function should:\n    *   Take as input a participant's schedule (blocked calendar events).\n    *   Account for the specified meeting duration (30 minutes).\n    *   Iterate through potential 30-minute slots and explicitly check for overlaps with blocked events.\n    *   Return a list of valid, non-overlapping 30-minute intervals.\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_available_intervals(schedule, meeting_duration=30, start_time=9*60, end_time=17*60): # Times in minutes from midnight\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates available 30-minute intervals for a participant, considering their schedule.\n\n        Args:\n            schedule: A list of tuples representing blocked time slots (start_time_minutes, end_time_minutes).\n            meeting_duration: Duration of the meeting in minutes (default 30).\n            start_time: Start of the window of consideration (default 9 AM)\n            end_time: End of the window of consideration (default 5 PM)\n\n        Returns:\n            A list of tuples representing available 30-minute intervals (start_time_minutes, end_time_minutes).\n        \"\"\"\n        available_intervals = []\n        current_time = start_time\n\n        while current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            is_available = True\n            for blocked_start, blocked_end in schedule:\n                if current_time < blocked_end and current_time + meeting_duration > blocked_start:\n                    is_available = False\n                    current_time = blocked_end # Move to after the blocked slot\n                    break # Slot is blocked so continue to the end_time of the blocking time\n            if is_available:\n                available_intervals.append((current_time, current_time + meeting_duration))\n                current_time += meeting_duration # advance to the next interval\n\n        return available_intervals\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement Atomic Slot Verification:** Create a function that checks if a proposed time slot is genuinely available for *all* participants. It should verify that the entire 30-minute block is free from conflicts for everyone:\n\n    ```python\n    def verify_slot_availability(proposed_start_time, participants_schedules, meeting_duration=30):\n        \"\"\"\n        Verifies if a given time slot is available for all participants.\n\n        Args:\n            proposed_start_time: The proposed start time in minutes from midnight.\n            participants_schedules: A dictionary where keys are participant names and values are their blocked schedules (list of tuples).\n            meeting_duration: The duration of the meeting in minutes (default is 30).\n\n        Returns:\n            True if the slot is available for everyone, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        for participant, schedule in participants_schedules.items():\n            for blocked_start, blocked_end in schedule:\n                if proposed_start_time < blocked_end and proposed_start_time + meeting_duration > blocked_start:\n                    return False  # Slot is blocked for this participant\n        return True  # Slot is available for all participants\n    ```\n\n3.  **Revise Solution Selection Logic:** After generating a list of potentially valid time slots, the system needs a more intelligent way to choose the \"best\" one. Instead of simply picking the *earliest* valid slot, consider these factors:\n    *   **Preferences:** Prioritize slots that align with participant preferences.\n    *   **Fairness:** Consider the distribution of meeting times across participants over time.\n    *   **Contextual Understanding:** Is the prompt asking for the *only* time slot, or *a* time slot. If just *a* time slot, consider randomly choosing a time slot to encourage diversity.\n\n4.  **LLM-Driven Information Extraction and schedule conflict resolution**: The suggested fixes involve using Python code for calculations. Instead, we should be leveraging LLMs for these tasks.\n   *   Use LLM calls to extract participant schedules in a structured format (e.g., JSON).\n   *   Create a new function called `is_time_available` that uses an LLM to answer whether or not a time is available. Use it in place of the function above\n   *   Use LLM calls to determine possible time conflicts. Example prompt: `Are these meeting times overlapping for any participant?

The system needs a significant overhaul in how it handles time-based constraints and validates potential solutions. The core issue is a failure to accurately translate the textual schedule information into a reliable representation for downstream reasoning. The reliance on procedural code for time management, which should be moved into LLM calls, is also a key issue.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Availability Analysis (in principle):** The overall strategy of breaking down availability by participant is sound. The problem decomposition has merit but the execution needs to be improved through LLM reasoning.\n*   **Constraint Consideration:** Recognizing and attempting to incorporate constraints like time limits and participant preferences is a positive aspect. The system has the ability to understand the *need* for constraints, but not the *application* of it.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Calculation:** The core weakness is the frequent miscalculation of available time slots, resulting in incorrect meeting time suggestions.\n*   **Lack of Holistic Schedule Assessment:** Failing to ensure a continuous, conflict-free 30-minute slot is available for all participants compromises solution validity.\n*   **Over-reliance on Procedural (Non-LLM) Calculations:** The current system relies too heavily on code to reason about time conflicts and availability. This is an area that LLMs can do easily.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Constraint Handling:** The most crucial capability to improve is the accurate and reliable handling of time-based constraints, specifically determining valid 30-minute meeting slots based on participants' existing schedules. This includes both extracting the schedule information and verifying its consistency. This must be done leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Replace Procedural Calculations with LLM Reasoning**: Replace the `calculate_available_intervals` and `verify_slot_availability` functions with calls to an LLM. Provide the LLM with structured schedule information (extracted in step 2), the meeting duration, and the desired time window. Use the LLM to reason about availability and identify potential conflicts. The LLM should provide a step-by-step explanation of how it arrived at its answer. This is more robust than brittle procedural code.\n\n    Here's how to do it:\n\n    ```python\n    def is_time_available(schedule_info, proposed_start_time, meeting_duration=30):\n        \"\"\"\n        Uses an LLM to determine if a time slot is available for all participants.\n\n        Args:\n            schedule_info: A structured representation of participant schedules.\n            proposed_start_time: The proposed start time in minutes from midnight.\n            meeting_duration: The duration of the meeting in minutes (default is 30).\n\n        Returns:\n            A tuple: (True/False, LLM explanation)\n        \"\"\"\n\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        I have the following schedule information for a meeting:\n        {schedule_info}\n        We need to schedule a {meeting_duration}-minute meeting starting at {proposed_start_time}.\n\n        Based on the schedule information, is this time slot available for everyone?\n\n        Explain your reasoning step by step. Consider any overlapping meetings or time conflicts.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        response = call_llm(prompt) # Make sure call_llm can take a system prompt\n        availability = \"available\" in response.lower()\n        return availability, response\n    ```\n\n2.  **Improve Information Extraction with LLM**: Enhance the system's ability to extract schedule information from the problem description using LLMs. Ensure that the extracted information is converted into a structured format (e.g., JSON) for easier processing. Use a validation step to ensure the LLM has extracted correctly.\n\n    Example prompt:\n\n    \"Extract the schedules for each person. For each person, return a JSON object with the following format:\\n\\n{\\n  \\\"person\\\": \\\"Name of person\\\",\\n  \\\"schedule\\\": [[\\\"start time\\\", \\\"end time\\\"], ...]\\n}\"\n\n    ```python\n    def extract_schedules_llm(problem_description):\n       \"\"\"Extracts schedules using LLM.\"\"\"\n       prompt = f\"\"\"Extract the schedules for each person. For each person, return a JSON object with the following format:\n\n       {{\n         \"person\": \"Name of person\",\n         \"schedule\": [[\"start time\", \"end time\"], ...]\n       }}\n\n       Problem Description: {problem_description}\"\"\"\n       response = call_llm(prompt)\n       try:\n           schedules = json.loads(response)\n           return schedules\n       except json.JSONDecodeError:\n           print(\"Error decoding JSON from LLM response.\")\n           return None\n    ```\n\n3.  **Implement Atomic Slot Verification with LLM**: Once the LLM returns the extracted schedules, verify the LLM's extracted schedule with another LLM call. Then, use the `is_time_available` function to check.\n\n    ```python\n    # Assume `extracted_schedules` contains the extracted schedules\n    # and `proposed_start_time` is a proposed meeting time.\n\n    available, explanation = is_time_available(extracted_schedules, proposed_start_time)\n\n    if available:\n        print(f\"The proposed time is available. LLM reasoning: {explanation}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The proposed time is NOT available. LLM reasoning: {explanation}\")\n    ```\n\n4.  **Revise Solution Selection Logic**:  Focus on having the LLM do the final decision. Present the LLM with the available times and let it choose a time based on preferences or fairness, as described above.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the system's capabilities are **stable but underperforming.** The foundational understanding is present, but the implementation needs significant refinement. By shifting to LLM-driven reasoning and constraint handling, the system has the potential for significant improvement.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Availability Analysis:** The system attempts to break down the availability of each participant, which is a logical approach to the problem.\n*   **Constraint Consideration:** The system explicitly considers the time constraints (9:00-17:00) and preferences of participants.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Calculation:** The system incorrectly calculates the available time slots for participants, leading to incorrect conclusions about the earliest available time.\n*   **Lack of Holistic Schedule Assessment:** The system seems to evaluate time slots individually without ensuring that a single, continuous 30-minute slot is available for all participants.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Incorrect Availability Interval Calculation:** The core bottleneck is the inaccurate calculation of available time intervals for each participant based on their existing schedules. If this initial step is flawed, the entire process is compromised.\n*   **Lack of Atomic Slot Verification:** The system fails to verify if there is a complete block of 30 minutes available for all participants together.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Consistent Miscalculation of Available Time:** Across multiple error cases, the system derives incorrect free time intervals for participants, which leads to the selection of wrong meeting times. This implies an error in the logic that processes schedule constraints.\n*   **Suboptimal Solution Choice:** Even when the system identifies a potentially valid time slot, it fails to select the correct one according to the golden answer. This suggests a flaw in comparing and ranking potential solutions.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is an **incorrect implementation of the logic for determining available time slots for each participant**, given their existing schedule. This logic appears to be flawed, resulting in the system identifying incorrect free time intervals. Specifically, it's failing to properly account for meeting durations and blocked calendar events when generating the availability ranges.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system needs improvement in extracting the blocked calendar events and time slots from the problem description with greater precision.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Enhance constraint handling to accurately determine available time intervals based on blocked events and meeting durations.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Improve solution verification to ensure that the selected time slot satisfies constraints for all participants, providing a single continuous block of time.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine Interval Calculation Logic:** Implement a more robust and accurate function for calculating free time intervals. This function should:\n    *   Take as input a participant's schedule (blocked calendar events).\n    *   Account for the specified meeting duration (30 minutes).\n    *   Iterate through potential 30-minute slots and explicitly check for overlaps with blocked events.\n    *   Return a list of valid, non-overlapping 30-minute intervals.\n\n    ```python\n    def calculate_available_intervals(schedule, meeting_duration=30, start_time=9*60, end_time=17*60): # Times in minutes from midnight\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates available 30-minute intervals for a participant, considering their schedule.\n\n        Args:\n            schedule: A list of tuples representing blocked time slots (start_time_minutes, end_time_minutes).\n            meeting_duration: Duration of the meeting in minutes (default 30).\n            start_time: Start of the window of consideration (default 9 AM)\n            end_time: End of the window of consideration (default 5 PM)\n\n        Returns:\n            A list of tuples representing available 30-minute intervals (start_time_minutes, end_time_minutes).\n        \"\"\"\n        available_intervals = []\n        current_time = start_time\n\n        while current_time + meeting_duration <= end_time:\n            is_available = True\n            for blocked_start, blocked_end in schedule:\n                if current_time < blocked_end and current_time + meeting_duration > blocked_start:\n                    is_available = False\n                    current_time = blocked_end # Move to after the blocked slot\n                    break # Slot is blocked so continue to the end_time of the blocking time\n            if is_available:\n                available_intervals.append((current_time, current_time + meeting_duration))\n                current_time += meeting_duration # advance to the next interval\n\n        return available_intervals\n    ```\n\n2.  **Implement Atomic Slot Verification:** Create a function that checks if a proposed time slot is genuinely available for *all* participants. It should verify that the entire 30-minute block is free from conflicts for everyone:\n\n    ```python\n    def verify_slot_availability(proposed_start_time, participants_schedules, meeting_duration=30):\n        \"\"\"\n        Verifies if a given time slot is available for all participants.\n\n        Args:\n            proposed_start_time: The proposed start time in minutes from midnight.\n            participants_schedules: A dictionary where keys are participant names and values are their blocked schedules (list of tuples).\n            meeting_duration: The duration of the meeting in minutes (default is 30).\n\n        Returns:\n            True if the slot is available for everyone, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        for participant, schedule in participants_schedules.items():\n            for blocked_start, blocked_end in schedule:\n                if proposed_start_time < blocked_end and proposed_start_time + meeting_duration > blocked_start:\n                    return False  # Slot is blocked for this participant\n        return True  # Slot is available for all participants\n    ```\n\n3.  **Revise Solution Selection Logic:** After generating a list of potentially valid time slots, the system needs a more intelligent way to choose the \"best\" one. Instead of simply picking the *earliest* valid slot, consider these factors:\n    *   **Preferences:** Prioritize slots that align with participant preferences.\n    *   **Fairness:** Consider the distribution of meeting times across participants over time.\n    *   **Contextual Understanding:** Is the prompt asking for the *only* time slot, or *a* time slot. If just *a* time slot, consider randomly choosing a time slot to encourage diversity.\n\n4.  **LLM-Driven Information Extraction and schedule conflict resolution**: The suggested fixes involve using Python code for calculations. Instead, we should be leveraging LLMs for these tasks.\n   *   Use LLM calls to extract participant schedules in a structured format (e.g., JSON).\n   *   Create a new function called `is_time_available` that uses an LLM to answer whether or not a time is available. Use it in place of the function above\n   *   Use LLM calls to determine possible time conflicts. Example prompt: `Are these meeting times overlapping for any participant? Explain step by step.`\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 1:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

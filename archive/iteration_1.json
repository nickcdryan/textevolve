  "approach_summary": "The script solves meeting scheduling problems by using a multi-stage LLM-driven approach that extracts information, analyzes constraints, generates a candidate schedule, and verifies/refines the solution. It decomposes the problem into specialized functions using LLM reasoning for each stage, using example-based prompts and system instructions to guide the LLM's behavior. The overall workflow uses a series of function calls: `main` orchestrates the process by calling `extract_meeting_info`, `analyze_constraints`, `generate_candidate_schedule`, and `verify_and_refine`, which each use `call_llm` to leverage the LLM and generate responses at each stage.",

Amanda prefers to meet before 11:00 on Tuesday. Let's examine available slots before 11:00 first.\n\n*   **Tuesday 9:30 - 10:00:** Amanda is available. Nathan is busy (9:00-10:30). Not valid.\n*   **Tuesday 10:30 - 11:00:** Amanda is available. Nathan is busy (9:00-10:30). Not valid.\n\nSince there are no slots available before 11:00 that accommodate both Amanda and Nathan, we need to consider slots after 11:00, relaxing Amanda's preference.\n\nLet's examine the time slots after 11:00 on Tuesday:\n\n*   **Tuesday 12:00 - 12:30:** Amanda is available (11:30-12:00 is busy). Nathan is busy (11:00-13:00). Not valid.\n*   **Tuesday 13:00 - 13:30:** Amanda is available. Nathan is busy (11:00-13:00).

      "text_report": "Okay, I will generate a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, raw execution output samples, and the specified guidelines.\n\n```\n## RUNTIME ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Implicit JSON Parsing Errors:** The \"Improvement Areas\" section mentions potential `JSONDecodeError` due to improper formatting. This is supported by the analysis, indicating a fragility in the system's reliance on LLM-generated JSON. This highlights a pattern where the LLM's output deviates from the expected format, causing downstream parsing to fail. This error pattern is critical because it prevents the agent from accurately processing structured data, hindering its ability to schedule meetings effectively.\n*   **Constraint Verification Logic Errors:** The system demonstrates inconsistencies in constraint verification. In Sample 2, it incorrectly identifies Zachary as unavailable at 10:30-11:00 on Monday, despite the provided context stating he's busy until 10:30 and *then again after 11:00*. This suggests a flawed comparison logic within the verification process, and is a key source of scheduling errors. This is also indicated by Sample 0 and 2 producing schedules that are already known to be invalid.\n*   **Canned Response Errors:** Sample 3 illustrates a significant issue: the AI gives a canned \"Okay, I understand\" response, failing to perform any scheduling action or constraint verification. This suggests that the system sometimes short-circuits its core logic, defaulting to a generic reply instead of attempting to solve the scheduling problem. This severely limits the agent's utility and indicates a failure to properly engage with the input request.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of the scheduling task and attempts to address constraints. However, its capabilities are severely limited by inaccurate constraint handling, flawed information extraction, and reliance on canned responses. The system's performance is currently poor, with an accuracy of only 20%.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempted Verification Loop:** The effort to verify proposed solutions against constraints is a positive aspect that should be maintained and strengthened.\n*   **Alternative Schedule Generation (Attempted):** The AI tries to find alternative schedules when the initial proposal fails. This is another key behaviour to preserve and refine.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Verification:** The core logic for verifying time slot availability is fundamentally flawed, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n*   **Unreliable Information Extraction & Representation:** The system struggles to reliably extract and structure scheduling information, hindering accurate comparisons and decision-making. The time constraints are not well represented, and thus are not well parsed.\n*   **Canned Response Default:** The AI sometimes defaults to canned responses instead of processing the scheduling request, indicating a failure in its core task engagement.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate constraint verification**. Without a reliable way to check time slot availability, the system cannot perform its core function effectively.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Revamp Constraint Verification Logic:**\n    *   **Implement Precise Time Comparisons:** Replace natural language parsing with direct time comparisons using start and end times. Represent time intervals as objects (e.g., JSON with `start_time` and `end_time` fields) for easier manipulation.\n    *   **Introduce Unit Testing:** Create unit tests specifically for the constraint-checking logic to validate its accuracy and catch errors early.\n    *   **Debug Incorrect Schedule Conclusions:** Manually trace the logic used in Sample 2 to find exactly where the schedule verification falters and ensure that Zachary is only marked unavailable during the times where he is busy.\n2.  **Enforce Structured Information Extraction:**\n    *   **Use JSON Schemas:** Implement JSON schemas for extracting participant schedules and other relevant information. This ensures a consistent data structure for processing.\n    *   **Provide Detailed LLM Instructions:** Clearly instruct the LLM to extract information into the defined JSON schema, providing examples of the desired format. If needed, break information extraction into multiple steps, with a separate LLM call for each element.\n    *   **Validate extracted schedules:** If a JSON schema is used, validate that the JSON is valid using Python code, and re-query if it is not.\n3.  **Eliminate Canned Responses:**\n    *   **Completely remove any canned responses.** The AI should always attempt to generate a schedule or explicitly state why it *cannot* be scheduled (e.g., \"No available time slots found\").\n    *   **Implement Time-Out Safeguards:** If the AI struggles to find a schedule within a reasonable time limit, implement a timeout mechanism to prevent indefinite loops. Upon timeout, the system should provide a structured response indicating the scheduling attempt failed due to time constraints. The max_attempts safeguard should also be implemented.\n4.  **Implement Robust Error Handling:**\n    *   **Wrap all JSON parsing operations in `try...except` blocks** to gracefully handle parsing errors. Log the errors for debugging and provide informative error messages to the user.\n    *   **Implement Fallback Mechanisms:** If JSON parsing fails, consider re-prompting the LLM with more specific instructions or using a simpler parsing method as a fallback. This is already partially implemented, but the traceback is suppressed.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but low**. The AI demonstrates some understanding of the task, but its core functionalities are unreliable. Without addressing the identified weaknesses, the system's performance will remain poor, and its capabilities will not improve. Implementing the provided action items should create a solid foundation for future improvements.\n```",

Ensure all constraints are correctly applied.\n*   **Information Extraction**: Improve the extraction by formatting into a structured format such as JSON list objects.\n*   **Solution Generation:** Improve the solution generation algorithm to minimize invalid candidates.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n*   **Refine Constraint Handling Logic:**\n    *   Develop a more robust and accurate algorithm for verifying time slots against participant schedules.\n    *   Use precise comparisons (e.g., checking for overlaps using start and end times) instead of potentially ambiguous natural language parsing.\n    *   Implement unit tests to validate the accuracy of the constraint-checking logic.\n*   **Structured Information Extraction:**\n    *   For `information_extraction`, explicitly instruct the LLM to extract the information into a specific structured format. For example, time intervals could be represented as JSON objects with start and end times, facilitating precise comparisons.\n    *   Use a JSON schema to enforce a consistent data structure for extracted information.\n*   **Implement Verification and Error Handling:**\n    *   When JSON parsing is needed, use try-except blocks with specific `JSONDecodeError` handling to provide more informative error messages and graceful fallback mechanisms.\n*   **Remove canned responses:** Remove any canned responses from the agent.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 0:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample 1:** constraint_handling, solution_verification\n*   **Sample 2:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample 3:** solution_generation\n",

This is supported by the analysis, indicating a fragility in the system's reliance on LLM-generated JSON. This highlights a pattern where the LLM's output deviates from the expected format, causing downstream parsing to fail. This error pattern is critical because it prevents the agent from accurately processing structured data, hindering its ability to schedule meetings effectively.\n*   **Constraint Verification Logic Errors:** The system demonstrates inconsistencies in constraint verification. In Sample 2, it incorrectly identifies Zachary as unavailable at 10:30-11:00 on Monday, despite the provided context stating he's busy until 10:30 and *then again after 11:00*. This suggests a flawed comparison logic within the verification process, and is a key source of scheduling errors. This is also indicated by Sample 0 and 2 producing schedules that are already known to be invalid.\n*   **Canned Response Errors:** Sample 3 illustrates a significant issue: the AI gives a canned \"Okay, I understand\" response, failing to perform any scheduling action or constraint verification. This suggests that the system sometimes short-circuits its core logic, defaulting to a generic reply instead of attempting to solve the scheduling problem. This severely limits the agent's utility and indicates a failure to properly engage with the input request.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of the scheduling task and attempts to address constraints. However, its capabilities are severely limited by inaccurate constraint handling, flawed information extraction, and reliance on canned responses. The system's performance is currently poor, with an accuracy of only 20%.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempted Verification Loop:** The effort to verify proposed solutions against constraints is a positive aspect that should be maintained and strengthened.\n*   **Alternative Schedule Generation (Attempted):** The AI tries to find alternative schedules when the initial proposal fails. This is another key behaviour to preserve and refine.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Verification:** The core logic for verifying time slot availability is fundamentally flawed, leading to incorrect conclusions.\n*   **Unreliable Information Extraction & Representation:** The system struggles to reliably extract and structure scheduling information, hindering accurate comparisons and decision-making. The time constraints are not well represented, and thus are not well parsed.\n*   **Canned Response Default:** The AI sometimes defaults to canned responses instead of processing the scheduling request, indicating a failure in its core task engagement.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate constraint verification**. Without a reliable way to check time slot availability, the system cannot perform its core function effectively.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Revamp Constraint Verification Logic:**\n    *   **Implement Precise Time Comparisons:** Replace natural language parsing with direct time comparisons using start and end times. Represent time intervals as objects (e.g., JSON with `start_time` and `end_time` fields) for easier manipulation.\n    *   **Introduce Unit Testing:** Create unit tests specifically for the constraint-checking logic to validate its accuracy and catch errors early.\n    *   **Debug Incorrect Schedule Conclusions:** Manually trace the logic used in Sample 2 to find exactly where the schedule verification falters and ensure that Zachary is only marked unavailable during the times where he is busy.\n2.  **Enforce Structured Information Extraction:**\n    *   **Use JSON Schemas:** Implement JSON schemas for extracting participant schedules and other relevant information. This ensures a consistent data structure for processing.\n    *   **Provide Detailed LLM Instructions:** Clearly instruct the LLM to extract information into the defined JSON schema, providing examples of the desired format. If needed, break information extraction into multiple steps, with a separate LLM call for each element.\n    *   **Validate extracted schedules:** If a JSON schema is used, validate that the JSON is valid using Python code, and re-query if it is not.\n3.  **Eliminate Canned Responses:**\n    *   **Completely remove any canned responses.** The AI should always attempt to generate a schedule or explicitly state why it *cannot* be scheduled (e.g., \"No available time slots found\").\n    *   **Implement Time-Out Safeguards:** If the AI struggles to find a schedule within a reasonable time limit, implement a timeout mechanism to prevent indefinite loops. Upon timeout, the system should provide a structured response indicating the scheduling attempt failed due to time constraints. The max_attempts safeguard should also be implemented.\n4.  **Implement Robust Error Handling:**\n    *   **Wrap all JSON parsing operations in `try...except` blocks** to gracefully handle parsing errors. Log the errors for debugging and provide informative error messages to the user.\n    *   **Implement Fallback Mechanisms:** If JSON parsing fails, consider re-prompting the LLM with more specific instructions or using a simpler parsing method as a fallback. This is already partially implemented, but the traceback is suppressed.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but low**. The AI demonstrates some understanding of the task, but its core functionalities are unreliable. Without addressing the identified weaknesses, the system's performance will remain poor, and its capabilities will not improve. Implementing the provided action items should create a solid foundation for future improvements.\n```"

This works!\nSince the problem states that there exists a solution, we can stop here since we found one.\n\nProposed Time: Monday, 12:00 - 12:30\n\nVerification:\nLet me check each constraint:\n1. Duration: The meeting is scheduled for 30 minutes (12:00-12:30) \u2713\n2. Work hours: Meeting time 12:00-12:30 is within 9:00-17:00 \u2713\n3. Valid day: Monday is the specified day \u2713\n4. Ryan's availability on Monday:\n   - Ryan is busy 9:00-9:30, 11:30-12:00, 14:30-15:00, 16:00-16:30\n   - The proposed time 12:00-12:30 does not overlap with Ryan's busy times \u2713\n5. Kenneth's availability on Monday:\n   - Kenneth is busy 9:30-10:30, 11:00-12:00, 12:30-13:00, 13:30-14:00, 14:30-16:30\n   - The proposed time 12:00-12:30 does not overlap with Kenneth's busy times \u2713\n6. Earliest availability: The prompt asks for the earliest availability. Since 10:30-11:00 did not work, and 12:00 - 12:30 does work, and there are no times between 10:30 and 12:00 that work, then this solution satisfies the prompt requirement.\n\nResult: INVALID - The solution conflicts with Kenneth's schedule on Monday from 9:30-10:30 and 11:00-12:00. The correct solution is Monday, 12:00-12:30.\n\nANSWER_END\n",

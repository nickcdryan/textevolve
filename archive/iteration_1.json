  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting relevant information from the input question using the `extract_meeting_info` function, which employs an LLM with few-shot examples and a verification loop to ensure completeness. The extracted information is then passed to the `schedule_meeting` function, which uses another LLM with few-shot examples to generate a meeting schedule. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `extract_meeting_info` and then `schedule_meeting` and returns the schedule. Other helper functions include `call_llm`, which takes prompts and system instructions and retrieves responses from the LLM model.",

However, in sample 1 we see the explanation \"Missing information in extraction, attempt 1/3: Let's analyze the provided extraction to see if it contains information on participants, duration, constraints, and schedules, and identify any missing information.\" This suggests that there are information extraction issues with the given scheduling problems.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1. **Information Extraction:** The system appears to be capable of extracting basic information like participants, duration, and constraints, as indicated by the \"Present\" markers in Sample 1's output.\n2. **Constraint Handling:** The output indicates that constraints like the timeframe and days are recognized as present.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Solution Generation:** The proposed meeting times consistently differ from the golden answers, indicating a failure to generate valid solutions that satisfy all constraints.\n2. **Constraint Handling:** Even though the system identifies constraints, it fails to properly incorporate them when generating a solution. This could include failing to correctly mark blocked calendar events as unavailable for scheduling.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Solution Generation and Constraint Handling:** The inability to generate valid solutions that adhere to all constraints is a critical bottleneck. This is likely caused by an incomplete or incorrect understanding of the constraints, schedules, or duration.\n2. **Time Reasoning:** The system demonstrates weak reasoning about time intervals and availability, leading to the selection of incorrect meeting times.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Incorrect Time Selection:** The most prominent error is selecting a meeting time that conflicts with the participants' schedules or preferences.\n2. **Misinterpretation of Availability:** The system seems to misinterpret or incompletely consider the provided schedules, leading to scheduling conflicts.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the failure to generate a valid meeting time that satisfies all participant schedules and preferences. This suggests a flaw in the solution generation logic and how it uses constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Solution Generation:** The system needs a more robust algorithm for generating meeting times. This should include better logic for identifying potential meeting slots and ensuring they are free for all participants.\n2. **Constraint Handling:** Improve the extraction and integration of constraints into the solution generation process. It needs a way to determine whether a specific time is allowed, or prohibited for all parties.\n3. **Time Reasoning:** Enhance the system's ability to reason about time intervals, durations, and availability. Consider implementing time-based calculations and comparisons.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm:** Utilize a constraint satisfaction algorithm to find meeting times. Represent the schedules as constraints, and the algorithm should find a solution that satisfies all constraints.\n2. **Develop a Time Reasoning Module:** Implement a module to handle time-related operations, such as checking for overlaps, calculating durations, and identifying available slots.\n3. **Improve Extraction Robustness with LLMs:** Use more advanced prompting techniques with LLMs to ensure accurate and complete extraction of all scheduling constraints and participant availability, including negative constraints (times when people *cannot* meet). Focus on minimizing the chance of \"missing information\" errors. Instead of brittle regex, extract using LLM calls: `extract_information(text, \"Extract available times for each person\")`\n4. **Verification Loop with Detailed Feedback:** After generating a potential meeting time, implement a verification step that explicitly checks all constraints. If a constraint is violated, provide specific feedback to the solution generation module for refinement.

This is incorrect and deviates from the intended \"ANSWER_START ...

This is a direct contradiction and highlights a major problem with how the system uses the extracted information.\n*   **Incomplete Time Specification (Sample 0):** The solution proposes a timeframe \"Monday, 11:30 - 12:00\" but lacks the year or date information. This missing detail renders the schedule moot.\n*   **LLM Confidence Miscalibration:** The system expresses a high degree of confidence that all information is present (sample 1), even when one of the participants has no availability. This indicates that the LLM cannot tell \"no availability\" from \"available.\"\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system currently has very limited scheduling capabilities.

The system has a serious deficit in time reasoning and constraint handling.

This means generating valid meeting times that respect all participants' schedules and preferences.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement a Verification Loop (Highest Priority):**  Immediately implement a verification loop *using LLMs* after generating a potential meeting time. The loop should explicitly check all constraints and participant availability, and provide very specific feedback to the solution generation module if a constraint is violated. Example verification prompt:\n    ```\n    \"Verify the following proposed meeting time is valid: {proposed_time} for participants {participants} given these individual constraints:\\n{individual_constraints}.  The meeting is {duration} long.  Specifically check:\\n a) Does proposed_time fall within timeframe constraints?\\n b) Does proposed_time conflict with any participant's known unavailable times?\\nRespond TRUE if *all* constraints are met, and FALSE with a specific reason if any constraint is violated.\"\n    ```\n2.  **Rearchitect Extraction Prompting for Robustness:** The current prompts need to be improved to minimize \"missing information\" errors. *Stop* relying on regex. Instead, use LLM calls like `extract_information(text, \"Extract available times for each person\")`. Include *negative constraints* explicitly (times when people *cannot* meet). Use few-shot examples that demonstrate how to handle different schedule formats and conflicting information.\n3.  **Improve Time Reasoning Module or LLM Instructions:** Improve the \"time reasoning module,\" (which may be the LLM itself), to check for overlaps, calculate durations, and identify available slots. Provide LLMs with clear examples and instructions on how to handle date-time related tasks. Specifically make it distinguish between \"no schedule\" and \"available.\"\n4. **Structured Output Validation and Correction:** Implement a function that validates the LLM output against the required format. If the output is not in the correct format, use the LLM to correct it. For sample 2, the validation function would detect the missing \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags, and the LLM would be prompted to reformat the output accordingly.\n5.  **Multi-stage solution generation**: First have the LLM extract the participants and constraints. Then generate a candidate list of all valid timeslots. Finally, select a solution and verify it. This ensures the space of solutions generated meets the criteria and eliminates incorrect solutions early on.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level**. There's no evidence of improvement. The inconsistent output format may even indicate a slight decline in reliability. Improvement requires a change in approach rather than iterative tweaking of the current strategy.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script implements a chain-of-thought approach to answer a question by breaking it down into sub-questions, answering each sub-question independently, and then synthesizing the individual answers into a final response. The `main` function orchestrates this process, using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model for question breakdown, answering sub-questions, and synthesizing the final answer. No agent roles are explicitly defined. The `call_llm` function is used to send prompts to the LLM and return the response, `main` takes the question and orchestrates the calls to `call_llm` to get the sub-questions, answers to sub-questions, and a final synthesis. The overall workflow involves question decomposition, answering sub-questions, and synthesizing the final answer.",

This indicates that the Large Language Model (LLM) call within the system is failing because it's receiving a `None` value when it expects an iterable object (like a list or tuple). This often points to a problem with data handling or function arguments. It implies a critical failure in how the system prepares and passes information to the LLM.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nSince there are no success cases, it's impossible to determine the strengths of the current approach.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1. **LLM Call Failure:** The system is highly susceptible to crashing with a `NoneType` error when calling the LLM. This suggests a lack of robust error handling and input validation before invoking the LLM.\n2. **Lack of Problem Solving:** The system fails to even begin attempting to solve the math problems; instead, it immediately returns an error.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1. **LLM Interface:** The primary bottleneck is the interface and communication with the LLM. The frequent `NoneType` errors indicate a fundamental flaw in how data is being prepared, passed, or handled during the LLM call.\n2. **Error Handling:** Lack of robust error handling around the LLM calls. The system should catch the `NoneType` exception, log the error, and attempt a fallback mechanism (e.g., retry with different parameters, return a default response, or gracefully terminate with an informative message).\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent error message across all error cases indicates a systematic issue, likely within a shared function or code block responsible for interacting with the LLM.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the consistent failure of the LLM call due to a `NoneType` argument. This suggests a data processing stage before the LLM call is producing a `None` value unexpectedly, which is then being passed as an argument when it should be an iterable. We need to identify *where* this `None` is originating and *why*.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1. **Input Validation:** Implement rigorous input validation before calling the LLM. Check that all required arguments are not `None` and are of the expected data type (e.g., string, list, dictionary).\n2. **Error Handling and Logging:** Wrap LLM calls in try-except blocks to catch potential exceptions, especially `TypeError` (which is often associated with `NoneType` errors). Log detailed information about the error (e.g., traceback, input parameters) to aid in debugging. Consider adding print statements of intermediate values to debug the flow of data.\n3. **Data Processing:** Examine the code that prepares the input data for the LLM. Identify the source of the `None` value and implement a fix to either prevent it from occurring or handle it gracefully (e.g., replace it with a default value, skip the LLM call if the data is invalid).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Add assertions:** Place `assert` statements before each LLM call to ensure that arguments are not `None`. For example, `assert question is not None, \"Question cannot be None\"`\n2. **Inspect Data Flow:** Insert print statements to inspect the value of variables right before the LLM call. Pay close attention to any data transformations or function calls that might be returning `None`.\n3. **Implement Fallback Mechanisms:** If the LLM call fails, implement a fallback mechanism such as:\n   - Retry the LLM call with slightly different parameters (e.g., a shorter question, a different prompt).\n   - Return a default response indicating that the system was unable to solve the problem.\n   - Generate an error message that is more informative than the current \"Error calling LLM\" message.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nAll samples with errors failed in the following capabilities because the initial LLM call failed and prevented any further processing:\n\n*   information_extraction\n*   constraint_handling\n*   solution_generation\n*   solution_verification\n*   decision_making\n",

The error message \"Error calling LLM: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable\" consistently appears, encapsulated within the \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags. This indicates that the system's core functionality, which relies on the LLM, is completely non-operational. The presence of these tags, even in error cases, shows a basic level of output structure is maintained, though irrelevant given the consistent error. The error suggests the issue arises very early in processing.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates *zero* capability in solving the intended task. Its performance is effectively non-existent due to the consistent and critical error preventing any meaningful processing. The desired capabilities of information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, verification, and decision-making are entirely unrealized in the current state.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\nCurrently, there are no demonstrable strengths. The system consistently fails. The existence of output structure (ANSWER_START/END) is a *very* minor positive, but irrelevant to the goal of actually solving problems.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1. **Catastrophic LLM Integration Failure:** The consistent `NoneType` error on the LLM call is the dominant and most critical weakness. This failure prevents the system from performing any of its intended functions.\n2. **Lack of Error Resilience:** The system doesn't gracefully handle the LLM call failure. It throws an error and halts, instead of attempting any fallback or alternative strategies.\n3. **Input Validation Deficiencies:** The system lacks sufficient input validation to prevent `None` values from being passed to the LLM.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **LLM Integration and Error Handling**. Stabilizing the LLM call and preventing the `NoneType` error is paramount. Without addressing this, no other capabilities can be developed or assessed.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. **Implement Immediate Pre-LLM Input Validation:**\n    *   **Action:** Insert explicit checks (using `if` statements or assertions) immediately before the LLM call to ensure that *all* arguments are not `None`. Include informative error messages if any argument is found to be `None`, specifying which argument caused the failure. For example:\n        ```python\n        if question is None:\n            print(\"ERROR: Question is None before LLM call!\")\n            return \"ERROR: Question is None\" # Return a graceful error message\n        # Add similar checks for all other arguments to the LLM call\n        llm_response = call_llm(question, other_argument)\n        ```\n    *   **Rationale:** This immediately pinpoints which argument to the LLM call is the source of the `None` value.\n\n2. **Trace Data Flow to Identify `None` Source:**\n    *   **Action:** Using print statements or a debugger, trace the values of all variables involved in generating the arguments passed to the LLM. Start from the earliest point where the arguments are constructed and track their values step-by-step. Log intermediate calculations that transform the initial input.\n    *   **Rationale:** This is essential to determine *why* the `None` value is being generated in the first place. Is it a failed data extraction? A missing value in the input data? A function returning `None` unexpectedly?\n\n3. **Implement Try-Except Block Around LLM Call:**\n    *   **Action:** Wrap the LLM call in a `try-except` block to catch potential exceptions (including `TypeError`, which is commonly associated with `NoneType` errors) and log detailed error information.\n        ```python\n        try:\n            llm_response = call_llm(question, other_argument)\n        except TypeError as e:\n            print(f\"ERROR calling LLM: {e}\")\n            import traceback\n            traceback.print_exc() # Print the full traceback\n            return \"ERROR: LLM call failed - see logs for details.\"\n        ```\n    *   **Rationale:** This provides robust error handling, prevents the program from crashing, and captures valuable debugging information. The traceback is *crucial* for understanding where the error originates.\n\n4. **Consider Data Imputation or Default Values:**\n    *   **Action:** Once the source of the `None` value is identified, consider strategies for handling it. If the `None` value represents a missing or unknown piece of information, explore options for data imputation (e.g., filling in the missing value with a reasonable default or using a machine learning model to predict the missing value).\n    *   **Rationale:** This prevents the system from crashing and allows it to continue processing, albeit with potentially less accurate results.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **stagnant and critically low**. The system shows no signs of progress. The focus must be on resolving the LLM integration issue before any meaningful improvement can be observed.\n",

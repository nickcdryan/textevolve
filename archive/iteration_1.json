The company\u2019s 1911 oil discovery in North Eastern Oklahoma opened up oil development in a great region from Eastern Oklahoma west to Mervine, Newkirk, Blackwell, Billings and Garber and led to the founding of the Marland Oil Company, later renamed the Continental Oil Company, now known as Conoco. \n\n=== Document 10: Rag Sefid oil field ===\nThe Rag Sefid oil field is an oil field located in Khuzestan Province, approximately 6\u00a0km in nearest distance from the Persian Gulf, southwest Iran. It was discovered in 1964 and developed by National Iranian Oil Company and began production in 1966. The total proven reserves of the Rag Sefid oil field are around 14,5 billion barrels, and production is centered on 180000 oilbbl/d . The field is owned by state-owned National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and operated by National Iranian South Oil Company (NISOC). \n\n\nProvide your answer based on the information in the supporting documents.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe runtime error observed across all error cases is:\n\n```\nTypeError: main() missing 1 required positional argument: 'supporting_documents'\n```\n\nThis indicates a fundamental issue with how the `main` function is being called in the `test_script_1.py` file. The `main` function is defined to accept two arguments: `question` and `supporting_documents`. However, the script is calling it with only one argument: `question`.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nSince all cases resulted in runtime errors related to function arguments, it's difficult to assess strengths. However, the fact that the traceback is clear and points directly to the problem is a minor strength, as it facilitates debugging.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Incorrect function call:** The primary weakness is the incorrect invocation of the `main` function within the testing script. It's missing a required argument.\n2.  **Lack of input validation/error handling within `main`:** While the immediate error is in the calling script, ideally the `main` function itself would include some basic error handling to catch missing arguments or incorrect data types.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\nThe critical bottleneck is the incorrect function call in the testing script. This prevents the model from even attempting to solve the problem, regardless of its reasoning capabilities.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe error pattern is consistent: a `TypeError` due to a missing argument in the function call.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the `test_script_1.py` file calling the `main` function incorrectly. It is calling `answer = module.main(question)` when it should be calling `answer = module.main(question, supporting_documents)`.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Testing Script:** Fix the function call in `test_script_1.py` to correctly pass both the `question` and `supporting_documents` arguments to the `main` function.\n2.  **Function Signature:** Ensure that the `main` function's signature in the main script explicitly defines the `question` and `supporting_documents` arguments. Consider using type hints for clarity.\n3.  **Input Validation:** Implement input validation within the `main` function to check if both arguments are provided and are of the expected type (e.g., strings). This will make debugging easier if the script is called incorrectly in the future.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Modify `test_script_1.py`:** Change the line `answer = module.main(question)` to `answer = module.main(question, supporting_documents)`.  Ensure `supporting_documents` is appropriately defined and populated with the document content before this line.\n2.  **Add Input Validation to `main` function:** Add code at the beginning of the `main` function to check for the existence and type of the arguments. For example:\n\n    ```python\n    def main(question: str, supporting_documents: str) -> str:\n        if not isinstance(question, str):\n            raise TypeError(\"Question must be a string\")\n        if not isinstance(supporting_documents, str):\n            raise TypeError(\"Supporting documents must be a string\")\n\n        # ... rest of the function ...\n    ```\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nSince the errors are due to a function call issue, no specific AI capabilities failed. The problem lies in the testing infrastructure, not the model's problem-solving ability. Therefore, none of the following capabilities failed:\n\n*   information\\_extraction\n*   constraint\\_handling\n*   solution\\_generation\n*   solution\\_verification\n*   decision\\_making\n",

This error originates from `test_script_1.py`, specifically line 261, where the `main` function is being called with only one argument (`question`) instead of the expected two (`question` and `supporting_documents`). This is a fundamental flaw in the testing setup, preventing the AI system from even attempting to process the input and generate a response. The consistency of the error across all three samples indicates a systemic problem in the testing script's implementation.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nDue to the persistent runtime error, it is impossible to accurately assess the AI system's underlying capabilities such as information extraction, constraint handling, or solution generation. The system is effectively blocked from performing any task because of the incorrect function call. The reported accuracy of 0.00 is meaningless in this context, as it reflects the failure of the test setup, not the AI model itself.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Clear Error Message:** The traceback provided is clear and directly identifies the missing argument in the function call, facilitating diagnosis and remediation.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Function Invocation:** The primary weakness is the flawed `test_script_1.py` script, which calls the `main` function incorrectly. This is a critical blocking issue.\n*   **Lack of Robust Input Validation:** While the immediate problem is in the test script, the `main` function could benefit from more robust input validation.

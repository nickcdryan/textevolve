  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using LLMs to extract constraints, propose times, and verify solutions. It decomposes the problem into constraint extraction, time proposal, and solution verification, using the functions `extract_meeting_constraints`, `propose_meeting_time`, and `verify_solution`. The main function `main` orchestrates the workflow by calling `extract_meeting_constraints` to extract constraints, `propose_meeting_time` to generate a proposed time, and `verify_solution` to verify that time, and `call_llm` to get results from the LLM. The overall workflow is to extract constraints, propose a meeting time, and then verify the proposed time against those constraints to give a final answer.",

You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant. Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Amanda and Nathan for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on either Monday or Tuesday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the days: \nAmanda is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:00, Tuesday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 10:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00; \nNathan is busy on Monday during 10:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 11:30, 13:30 to 14:30, 16:00 to 16:30, Tuesday during 9:00 to 10:30, 11:00 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 15:30, 16:00 to 16:30; \n\nAmanda do not want to meet on Tuesday after 11:00. Nathan can not meet on Monday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: "

Preference handling: The system sometimes fails to honor the preferences provided in the prompts.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** The system's inability to consistently and correctly process all constraints is the most critical bottleneck.

The dates appear to be present, and are a crucial feature of the outputs.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nOverall, the system demonstrates a rudimentary capability to generate meeting time proposals. It can identify and attempt to satisfy scheduling requests. However, its core capability is undermined by inconsistent constraint handling, as highlighted in the error analysis.

The system MUST be able to reliably filter out time slots that violate specified constraints.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Structured Constraint Representation:** As suggested in the previous report, represent constraints as a structured data format (list of dictionaries) within the system. This should include positive constraints (available times) and negative constraints (times when participants are unavailable or prefer not to meet). This must be implemented to improve reliability and consistency in handing of constraints.\n2.  **Develop Rule-Based Filtering with Code:** Implement a deterministic Python function that filters potential meeting times based on the structured constraint representation. This function should systematically eliminate any time slot that violates *any* constraint. The time must be output in consistent formatting.\n3.  **Create a Verification Agent:** Design a separate \"Verification Agent\" that takes the original problem description, the proposed solution, and the structured constraint representation as input. This agent should independently verify whether the proposed solution satisfies *all* constraints. Report *specifically* which constraints are violated if the solution is invalid. This agent should run independent from the other solution agents.\n4.  **Implement Few-Shot Learning with Targeted Examples:** Create 3-5 few-shot learning examples that *specifically* demonstrate constraint handling. Include examples with various types of constraints, especially negative constraints and preferences. Emphasize the importance of adhering to *all* constraints in the examples.\n5. **Implement a Verification Loop**: If the verifier finds problems, create a feedback loop that sends information on the constraints and the error that was found to the solver to improve its solution.\n6.  **Consistent Time Formatting**: Normalize time representations. LLMs extract/understand text more reliably with consistent formatting. This will ensure correct translation between natural language, LLM, and Python-based functions.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the accuracy score of 0.60 and the error patterns identified, the system's capabilities are currently at a **stable** but **low** level. Improvement is urgently needed in constraint handling and solution verification to increase accuracy and reliability. The sample outputs do not reveal any glaring regressions; the main issue is the lack of substantial progress in addressing the fundamental weakness in constraint handling. Without these capabilities improving, the system will remain unreliable and is unlikely to meet the goals of a production-ready scheduling system.\n",

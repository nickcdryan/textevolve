  "approach_summary": "The script decomposes the grid transformation problem into identifying grid features, translating the transformation rule, applying the rule, and verifying the result. It leverages the Gemini LLM through the `call_llm` function to perform these steps, acting as feature identifier, transformation translator, grid transformer, and transformation verifier respectively. The overall workflow involves calling `identify_grid_features` to extract grid properties, `translate_transformation_rule` to describe the transformation, `apply_transformation_rule` to generate the transformed grid, and finally, `verify_transformed_grid` to check the correctness of the solution. The `main` function orchestrates these calls, passing the question and intermediate results between the functions.",

The transformation involves checking each cell in the input grid. If a cell contains a 0 and it is adjacent to a non-zero value (2, 3, 4, 8, 9), then the 0 is replaced by that non-zero value. The adjacency is checked horizontally and vertically. Values of 1 and 4 seem to be invariant and stay where they are.\n\nTransformed Grid: ```python\n[\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nVerification Result: Incorrect. The transformation appears to involve replacing certain values based on their position in the grid. The training examples suggest the numbers 8, 2, 3, and 9 are added to specific locations in the grid. Based on example 1, the values 8, 2, 1, and 3 appear to the right. Based on examples 2 and 3, there are sometimes values to the left as well. Let's look closely at the first few rows of the given transformation and see if it follows the training set. The first two rows and the 3rd row are correct. The 4th row has the 8's in the right spot and the 2's also look like they are in the right spot. In the given example, in rows 4, 5, and 18, 19 columns 7 and 8 have the value 8, and columns 16 and 17 have the value 2. These rows are correctly transformed in the provided example. However, columns 22 and 23 have 3 added for the right-most 8 and 2 which is NOT correct.\n\n\nANSWER_START\n```python\n[\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

The transformation involves checking each cell in the input grid. If a cell contains a 0 and it is adjacent to a non-zero value (2, 3, 4, 8, 9), then the 0 is replaced by that non-zero value. The adjacency is checked horizontally and vertically.

The transformation appears to involve replacing certain values based on their position in the grid. The training examples suggest the numbers 8, 2, 3, and 9 are added to specific locations in the grid. Based on example 1, the values 8, 2, 1, and 3 appear to the right. Based on examples 2 and 3, there are sometimes values to the left as well. Let's look closely at the first few rows of the given transformation and see if it follows the training set. The first two rows and the 3rd row are correct. The 4th row has the 8's in the right spot and the 2's also look like they are in the right spot. In the given example, in rows 4, 5, and 18, 19 columns 7 and 8 have the value 8, and columns 16 and 17 have the value 2. These rows are correctly transformed in the provided example. However, columns 22 and 23 have 3 added for the right-most 8 and 2 which is NOT correct.\n\n\nANSWER_START\n```python\n[\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nANSWER_END\n",

This is a fundamental bottleneck that prevents the system from generating correct solutions.\n- **Adaptive Learning:** The system lacks a mechanism to learn from its mistakes. The \"Verification Result: Incorrect\" feedback doesn't trigger a refinement or adaptation of the transformation logic, leading to repeated errors.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- The system incorrectly identifies the transformation rules, especially when the rules involve multiple conditions or relationships between elements.\n- The generated Python code reflects the misidentified transformation rules, leading to incorrect output grids.\n- The \"Verification Result: Incorrect\" feedback appears to be ignored; the system does not attempt to correct its errors.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to accurately infer the underlying rules governing grid transformations, particularly when these rules are complex and require considering relationships between different grid elements (rows, columns, adjacent cells). This leads to incorrect transformation logic and ultimately, incorrect output grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Information Extraction:** Improve the system's ability to extract nuanced transformation rules from the training examples. This requires the ability to identify dependencies between different parts of the grid.\n- **Constraint Handling:** The system needs to be better at understanding and applying constraints derived from the training examples. This may involve improving the way the system represents and reasons about the transformation rules.\n- **Solution Verification:** The system needs a feedback loop where identifying an incorrect solution triggers a revision of the transformation rules and a re-generation of the output grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Enhanced Feature Extraction:** Implement more sophisticated feature extraction techniques to identify patterns such as \"if cell (x,y) is X, then cell (x+1, y+1) becomes Y,\" or \"if column 1 contains value A, then column 5 becomes B\". Consider using image processing techniques or more advanced pattern recognition algorithms.\n- **Rule Representation:** Improve the representation of transformation rules. Instead of simple \"replace X with Y,\" use a rule-based system that can represent more complex relationships, conditions, and dependencies. Consider using a declarative language for expressing these rules.\n- **Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback mechanism where the \"Verification Result: Incorrect\" message triggers an attempt to revise the transformation rules. This could involve trying alternative interpretations of the training examples or adjusting the weights of different rules.\n- **Code Generation Refinement:** Condition code generation to the detected pattern. The code generation module should take the extracted feature rules and constraints as input and generate code to correctly implement the transform in question.\n- **Introduce Intermediate Outputs:** Add print statements to display the extracted transformation rules, the generated code, and intermediate grid states. This will allow for easier debugging and analysis of the system's reasoning process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample ID 0:**\n    - information_extraction: Failed to accurately identify the complex transformation pattern.\n    - solution_generation: Failed to generate a correct output based on the misidentified pattern.\n    - solution_verification: Identified the error but did not trigger a corrective action.\n- **Sample ID 1:**\n    - information_extraction: Failed to accurately identify the transformation pattern.\n    - solution_generation: Failed to generate a correct output based on the misidentified pattern.\n    - solution_verification: Identified the error but did not trigger a corrective action.\n- **Sample ID 2:**\n    - information_extraction: Failed to accurately identify the complex transformation pattern.\n    - solution_generation: Failed to generate a correct output based on the misidentified pattern.\n    - solution_verification: Identified the error but did not trigger a corrective action.\n",

Specifically:\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Identification:** The system often misinterprets the transformation rules, particularly when they involve relationships between multiple rows, columns, or specific cell values. This is evident in Sample ID 0 and 2 where complex dependencies are not correctly identified.\n*   **Lack of Corrective Feedback:** The \"Verification Result: Incorrect\" feedback is not effectively used to refine the solution. The system does not appear to adjust its transformation logic based on this feedback, resulting in repeated errors. The generated code remains unchanged even after verification fails.\n*   **Over-Generalization/Oversimplification:** The system seems to favor overly simplistic transformations and struggles with nuances and exceptions within the patterns.\n*   **Code Generation Inconsistency:** While the system generates valid Python code, the code's logic directly reflects the flawed pattern identification, leading to incorrect output grids.\n*   **\"Hallucination\" of Patterns:** In some cases, the system seems to identify patterns that are not actually present in the training examples, leading to incorrect transformations.\n*   **Correct identification of constraints are not adequately used.** As an example, in Sample ID 0, the \"verification result\" mentions correctly identified constraints but these constraints are not used to guide the code generation.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates very limited capability in accurately transforming grids based on learned patterns. While it can identify basic grid features and attempt to describe transformations, its core functionality of pattern recognition and rule application is significantly deficient. The lack of a feedback loop for error correction further exacerbates the problem. It is important to note, however, that valid code generation is a good starting point.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   The system can identify basic grid features (dimensions, present values).\n*   The system attempts to describe the transformation occurring between the input and output grids.\n*   The system is generally able to generate valid python code.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Inaccurate Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to accurately identify complex transformation patterns, especially those involving dependencies on multiple columns/rows or intricate relationships.\n*   **Lack of Adaptive Learning:** The system fails to learn from its mistakes; the verification feedback does not trigger a refinement of the transformation logic.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Simple Transformations:** The system tends to favor simple transformations and misses complex or subtle patterns.\n*   **Inadequate Constraint Handling:** Identified constraints are not adequately used during code generation.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition**. Without accurate pattern identification, the system cannot generate correct solutions, regardless of its other strengths.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Enhanced Feature Extraction:**\n    *   Introduce more sophisticated techniques for identifying relationships between grid elements.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Implement convolutional filters to detect local patterns and relationships between adjacent cells. Explore using techniques from time-series analysis if changes across rows/columns represent a sequence.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Use \"attention mechanisms\" to allow the system to focus on the most relevant parts of the input grid when identifying patterns.\n2.  **Develop a Rule-Based Representation:**\n    *   Move beyond simple \"replace X with Y\" rules and use a more expressive representation that can capture complex conditions and dependencies.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Implement a rule-based system using a declarative language like Prolog or a custom rule engine. This will allow for more flexible and precise definition of transformation rules.\n3.  **Introduce a Feedback Loop with Rule Revision:**\n    *   When \"Verification Result: Incorrect\" is received, trigger a process to revise the transformation rules.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Implement a mechanism where the system tries alternative interpretations of the training examples or adjusts the weights/priorities of different rules based on the verification feedback.\n    *   **Specific Action:** After a failed verification, present the failed output and the correct output to the system and ask it to find the differences and reasons for the difference.\n4.  **Condition Code Generation based on Detected Pattern:**\n    *   Ensure the code generation module takes the extracted feature rules and constraints as input.\n    *   **Specific Action:**  Refactor the code generation module to receive the extracted feature rules in a structured format (e.g., a dictionary or a set of objects) and use these rules to generate the appropriate code.\n5.  **Introduce Intermediate Outputs for Debugging:**\n    *   Add print statements to display the extracted transformation rules, the generated code, and intermediate grid states.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Implement logging to track the system's reasoning process. This will allow for easier debugging and analysis of errors. This is particularly useful if rule weights/priorities are being adjusted.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Add a visualization step to display the extracted features and the corresponding transformation rules. This can help identify issues with the feature extraction process.\n6.  **Implement Data Augmentation:**\n    *   Increase the diversity of the training data by creating variations of existing examples.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Rotate, flip, and transpose the input grids to create new training examples. Add noise or small perturbations to the grid values.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are **stable, but at a low level**. Without significant improvements in pattern recognition and adaptive learning, the system will continue to generate incorrect solutions.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors (JSONDecodeError, TypeError, etc.) were found in the 'output' fields.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n- The system can identify basic grid features like dimensions and present values.\n- The system attempts to describe the transformation occurring between the input and output grids.\n- The system is generally able to generate valid python code even if the code does not fully solve the problem.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n- The system struggles to accurately identify the transformation pattern, especially when it involves dependencies on multiple columns or rows or complex relationships between values.\n- The verification process highlights errors but doesn't lead to a refined solution in the provided examples, indicating a lack of feedback loop for improving the transformation logic.\n- The current approach favors simple transformations and misses complex or subtle patterns, even when presented in the training examples.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n- **Pattern Recognition:** The system's core weakness is its inability to accurately discern complex relationships and dependencies in the grid transformation patterns. This is a fundamental bottleneck that prevents the system from generating correct solutions.\n- **Adaptive Learning:** The system lacks a mechanism to learn from its mistakes. The \"Verification Result: Incorrect\" feedback doesn't trigger a refinement or adaptation of the transformation logic, leading to repeated errors.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n- The system incorrectly identifies the transformation rules, especially when the rules involve multiple conditions or relationships between elements.\n- The generated Python code reflects the misidentified transformation rules, leading to incorrect output grids.\n- The \"Verification Result: Incorrect\" feedback appears to be ignored; the system does not attempt to correct its errors.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to accurately infer the underlying rules governing grid transformations, particularly when these rules are complex and require considering relationships between different grid elements (rows, columns, adjacent cells). This leads to incorrect transformation logic and ultimately, incorrect output grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n- **Information Extraction:** Improve the system's ability to extract nuanced transformation rules from the training examples. This requires the ability to identify dependencies between different parts of the grid.\n- **Constraint Handling:** The system needs to be better at understanding and applying constraints derived from the training examples. This may involve improving the way the system represents and reasons about the transformation rules.\n- **Solution Verification:** The system needs a feedback loop where identifying an incorrect solution triggers a revision of the transformation rules and a re-generation of the output grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n- **Enhanced Feature Extraction:** Implement more sophisticated feature extraction techniques to identify patterns such as \"if cell (x,y) is X, then cell (x+1, y+1) becomes Y,\" or \"if column 1 contains value A, then column 5 becomes B\". Consider using image processing techniques or more advanced pattern recognition algorithms.\n- **Rule Representation:** Improve the representation of transformation rules. Instead of simple \"replace X with Y,\" use a rule-based system that can represent more complex relationships, conditions, and dependencies. Consider using a declarative language for expressing these rules.\n- **Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback mechanism where the \"Verification Result: Incorrect\" message triggers an attempt to revise the transformation rules. This could involve trying alternative interpretations of the training examples or adjusting the weights of different rules.\n- **Code Generation Refinement:** Condition code generation to the detected pattern. The code generation module should take the extracted feature rules and constraints as input and generate code to correctly implement the transform in question.\n- **Introduce Intermediate Outputs:** Add print statements to display the extracted transformation rules, the generated code, and intermediate grid states. This will allow for easier debugging and analysis of the system's reasoning process.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n- **Sample ID 0:**\n    - information_extraction: Failed to accurately identify the complex transformation pattern.\n    - solution_generation: Failed to generate a correct output based on the misidentified pattern.\n    - solution_verification: Identified the error but did not trigger a corrective action.\n- **Sample ID 1:**\n    - information_extraction: Failed to accurately identify the transformation pattern.\n    - solution_generation: Failed to generate a correct output based on the misidentified pattern.\n    - solution_verification: Identified the error but did not trigger a corrective action.\n- **Sample ID 2:**\n    - information_extraction: Failed to accurately identify the complex transformation pattern.\n    - solution_generation: Failed to generate a correct output based on the misidentified pattern.\n    - solution_verification: Identified the error but did not trigger a corrective action.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by decomposing the problem and finding available time slots using LLMs. The `main` function first uses `call_llm` to decompose the scheduling problem by extracting participants, duration, and schedule constraints. Then, `find_available_time_slots` uses `call_llm` to identify the best single available time slot given the identified constraints. Finally, `format_answer` formats the output for the user.",

This suggests the prompt engineering is effectively controlling the output structure.\n*   **Time Suggestion Generation:** The system *is* generating plausible meeting times. It's not simply failing to produce an answer; it *is* proposing times. The problem is the times are often incorrect due to constraint violations.\n*   **Limited Temporal Reasoning:** The system appears capable of suggesting times within a date range, but it struggles to apply complex temporal reasoning based on provided schedules and preferences.\n*   **Lack of Detailed Justification:** The output lacks any explanation of *why* a particular time was chosen. This absence of reasoning makes it difficult to debug and understand the decision-making process.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system currently possesses a rudimentary ability to understand the scheduling problem and produce formatted output. However, its core capability to generate *valid* meeting times is severely limited by poor constraint handling and solution verification. The system exhibits a strong *understanding* of the task, but a weak *execution* of the scheduling logic.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Format Consistency:**  Maintain the prompt engineering that ensures consistent output format. This simplifies parsing and integration with other systems.\n*   **Problem Understanding:** The system does grasp the basic concept of scheduling, suggesting that its reasoning ability is not completely absent.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Constraint Handling (Critical):** This is the most significant weakness. The system frequently ignores or misinterprets schedule constraints.\n*   **Solution Verification (Critical):** The lack of a verification mechanism allows incorrect solutions to be presented as valid.\n*   **Preference Integration:** The inability to handle preferences is a major limitation for real-world usability.\n*   **Lack of Explainability:** The absence of reasoning or justification in the output makes debugging difficult.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**.  Improving constraint handling is the foundation upon which better solution verification and preference integration can be built.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, prioritized for maximum impact:\n\n1.  **Implement Structured Information Extraction with LLM and Verification:**\n    *   **Goal:** To reliably extract participant schedules and preferences into a structured, machine-readable format (e.g., a dictionary or JSON object).\n    *   **Implementation:**\n        *   Use an LLM with a carefully crafted prompt and few-shot examples to extract schedule and preference information from the input text.  The prompt should explicitly define the expected structure of the output.\n        *   Immediately following the extraction, implement a *verification* step. Another LLM (or even deterministic code) should check the extracted information for completeness, correctness, and consistency.  For example:\n            *   \"Does the extracted schedule contain all the days of the week?\"\n            *   \"Are the time ranges valid (e.g., start time before end time)?\"\n            *   \"Are there any conflicting entries in the schedule?\"\n        *   If the verification fails, re-prompt the information extraction step with specific feedback on what needs to be corrected.  Limit the number of retries (e.g., `max_attempts=3`) to prevent infinite loops.\n\n2.  **Implement a Constraint Satisfaction Function:**\n    *   **Goal:** To create a function that definitively determines whether a proposed meeting time satisfies *all* schedule and preference constraints.\n    *   **Implementation:**\n        *   The function should take the proposed meeting time and the structured schedule/preference data as input.\n        *   It should iterate through each participant's schedule, checking for conflicts (e.g., proposed time overlaps with a busy slot).\n        *   It should also check if the proposed time aligns with any stated preferences (e.g., \"John prefers morning meetings\").\n        *   The function should return a boolean value (True if all constraints are satisfied, False otherwise), *and* a detailed explanation of *which* constraints were violated. This explanation is crucial for debugging and refinement.\n\n3.  **Implement a ReAct-Style Iterative Refinement Loop:**\n    *   **Goal:** To enable the system to propose a solution, verify its correctness, and iteratively refine it until all constraints are satisfied.\n    *   **Implementation:**\n        *   **Reason:** (LLM) Analyze the input and available schedules/preferences.\n        *   **Act:** (LLM) Propose a potential meeting time.\n        *   **Observe:** (Constraint Satisfaction Function) Verify if the proposed time satisfies all constraints.  If not, receive a detailed explanation of the violations.\n        *   **Refine:** (LLM) Based on the violation details, adjust the proposed meeting time to avoid the conflicts.\n        *   Repeat the \"Act,\" \"Observe,\" and \"Refine\" steps until a valid solution is found or a maximum number of iterations (`max_iterations=5`) is reached.\n        *   If a valid solution cannot be found within the iteration limit, return a message indicating that a suitable time could not be determined.\n\n4. **(Optional) Implement Few-Shot Examples for Preference Handling:** Include a few-shot example for preference handling in the prompt.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nWith an accuracy of 0.20, the current capability trend is **stable but low**.  Without significant changes, the system is unlikely to improve. However, implementing the above recommendations has a high potential to drive a **positive capability trend**. The key is to focus on the fundamental issue of constraint handling.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, you'll move from a system that *guesses* at meeting times to one that systematically analyzes constraints, verifies solutions, and iteratively refines its proposals. This will lead to a substantial improvement in accuracy and usability.\n",

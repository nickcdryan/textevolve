  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini API for extracting information and finding available times. The problem is decomposed into three main steps: extracting meeting details using `extract_meeting_info`, extracting participant schedules using `extract_schedules`, and finding an available time slot using `find_available_time`. The `main` function orchestrates these steps, handling errors and returning the proposed meeting time. The workflow is `main` -> `extract_meeting_info` -> `extract_schedules` -> `find_available_time` -> `call_llm` in each of these functions, with information passed from one LLM call to the next.",

The prompt includes the necessary information to solve the scheduling problems, such as participant schedules, meeting durations, and time preferences.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system consistently fails to extract meeting information from the provided text, leading to the inability to propose a valid meeting time.\n2.  The system lacks robustness in handling variations in input text and complex constraints.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The inability to accurately and reliably extract key details (participant names, schedules, constraints) from the input text is the primary bottleneck.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** Because information extraction fails, constraint handling is never reached, meaning it is unknown whether that would work or not.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **\"Could not extract meeting information\"**: This generic error message appears in all error cases, indicating a consistent failure at the initial information extraction stage.\n2.  **Inability to Handle Multiple Constraints:** The problems involve multiple participants with varying schedules and preferences, which might overwhelm the current extraction and reasoning capabilities.\n3. **Limited Reasoning Depth:** The system likely relies on surface-level pattern matching instead of deep semantic understanding and reasoning to infer availabilities.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the failure of the **information extraction module** to reliably identify and parse participant names, their schedules, and meeting constraints from the input text. The error is not just about \"parsing,\" but about the LLM's understanding of the text's semantic structure and its ability to extract the relevant information accurately in a structured format suitable for downstream processing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the information extraction capability, focusing on the extraction of participant names, their schedules (busy times), meeting duration, and any specific constraints or preferences.\n2.  **Error Handling**: The generic \"Could not extract meeting information\" message is not helpful. Improve error handling to provide more specific and informative error messages indicating what type of information could not be extracted and why.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine the Information Extraction Module with LLM calls:** Implement a more robust information extraction module that uses LLM calls (rather than regex) to identify participant names, schedules, and constraints. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to break down the extraction process, such as:\n    *   \"First, identify all the participants in the meeting.\"\n    *   \"Next, for each participant, extract their busy times on each day.\"\n    *   \"Finally, identify any additional constraints or preferences mentioned in the text.\"\n    *   Structure the extracted information into a structured format (e.g., JSON). For example:\n```json\n{\n    \"participants\": [\"Raymond\", \"Sophia\", \"Lori\", \"Dorothy\"],\n    \"duration\": \"half an hour\",\n    \"days\": [\"Monday\"],\n    \"work_hours\": [\"9:00\", \"17:00\"],\n    \"schedules\": {\n        \"Raymond\": {\"Monday\": [\"9:30-10:00\", \"12:30-14:30\", \"15:30-16:00\"]},\n        \"Sophia\": {\"Monday\": []},\n        \"Lori\": {\"Monday\": [\"9:00-9:30\", \"10:30-13:00\", \"14:30-15:00\", \"15:30-17:00\"]},\n        \"Dorothy\": {\"Monday\": [\"9:00-13:30\", \"14:00-15:00\", \"16:00-16:30\"]}\n    },\n    \"preferences\": {}\n}\n```\n2. **Implement Data Validation with LLM-based Verification:** Implement a separate validation step after information extraction. This step uses an LLM to verify the extracted information against the original text. The LLM should check:\n    *  Completeness: Are all participants and their schedules extracted?\n    *  Consistency: Are there any conflicting or illogical time slots?\n    *  Accuracy: Does the extracted information accurately reflect the text?\n    * If the validation step identifies errors, it should trigger a re-extraction process with more focused prompts.\n\n3.  **Use a specialized agent for parsing:** Create a parsing agent that takes in the original question and extracts all relevant information. This agent is specifically responsible for identifying participants, constraints, and schedules, and outputting a structured representation of this data. An example would be json as in suggestion 1.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates extremely limited capability in scheduling tasks, achieving zero accuracy across the test samples. Its primary deficiency lies in reliably extracting necessary information from the provided text. While the system receives clear instructions and has sufficient input data, its inability to parse and understand the text's structure prevents it from progressing to subsequent stages of the scheduling process. The system is effectively non-functional for the intended purpose.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Task Definition:** The system benefits from a well-defined task and explicit instructions.\n2.  **Sufficient Input Data:** The prompts provide all the information needed to solve the scheduling problems.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Failure:** The consistent inability to accurately extract participant names, schedules, and constraints from text renders the system useless.\n2.  **Error Message Vagueness:** Generic error messages hinder debugging and targeted improvement.\n3.  **Constraint Handling Untested:** The failure to extract information prevents evaluation of constraint handling capabilities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Information Extraction:** Improving the accuracy and robustness of information extraction is paramount. Without reliable information extraction, no other scheduling functionalities can be tested or improved.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   Replace the existing parsing mechanism (likely regex-based, which is not working) with an LLM-based approach.\n    *   Develop a function that uses chain-of-thought prompting to guide the LLM to extract relevant information (participants, schedules, duration, constraints).\n    *   The extracted information should be structured into a standard format like JSON (as per the previous suggestion).\n    *   Example LLM call:\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_info(text):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            Analyze the following text to extract information for scheduling a meeting. Identify:\n            1. The names of all participants.\n            2. For each participant, their busy times on each day.  Include the day.\n            3. The desired duration of the meeting.\n            4. Any other constraints or preferences mentioned.\n\n            Present the output in JSON format:\n            {{\n                \"participants\": [\"name1\", \"name2\", ...],\n                \"duration\": \"...\",\n                \"constraints\": \"...\",\n                \"schedules\": {{\n                    \"name1\": {{\"Monday\": [\"time1\", \"time2\"], \"Tuesday\": [...]}},\n                    \"name2\": {{\"Monday\": [...], \"Tuesday\": [...]}},\n                    ...\n                }}\n            }}\n\n            Text: {text}\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n            try:\n                return json.loads(response)\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                return None # Handle JSON parsing errors\n        ```\n\n2.  **Implement LLM-Driven Data Validation:**\n    *   Create a `verify_extracted_info` function that takes the original text and the extracted JSON data as input.\n    *   This function uses an LLM call to check the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the extracted data against the source text.\n    *   If discrepancies are found, log detailed error messages and trigger re-extraction (potentially with more specific prompts).\n    * Example LLM call:\n        ```python\n        def verify_extracted_info(text, extracted_data):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are a data validation expert. Analyze the following text and the corresponding extracted information (in JSON format). Verify that the extracted information is complete, accurate, and consistent with the original text.\n\n            Text: {text}\n\n            Extracted Information (JSON):\n            {json.dumps(extracted_data)}\n\n            Specifically, check the following:\n            1. Are all participants mentioned in the text included in the 'participants' list?\n            2. For each participant, does the 'schedules' section accurately reflect their busy times as stated in the text?  Are the days correct?\n            3. Does the 'duration' field match the meeting duration specified in the text?\n            4. Are any other constraints or preferences mentioned in the text accurately represented in the 'constraints' field?\n            5. Are there any illogical time slots that don't make sense?\n\n            Provide a detailed report of any discrepancies or errors found. If everything is accurate return \"No Issues Found\".\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n            return response  # The response will contain the verification report or \"No Issues Found\"\n        ```\n\n3.  **Improve Error Handling:**\n    *   Instead of a generic \"Could not extract meeting information\" message, implement more specific error handling within the `extract_meeting_info` function.\n    *   If `json.loads()` fails, log a specific error indicating a JSON parsing problem.\n    *   If the LLM returns an empty or incomplete JSON object, log an error indicating which information is missing (e.g., \"Could not extract participants' names\").\n\n4. **Create a Parsing Agent**:\n    * Create a distinct parsing agent responsible for extracting relevant information.\n    * Feed it with the original question/problem and design it to output a structured data representation (e.g., JSON).\n    * Ensure this agent handles variations in input format and constraints.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining/Stable:** The system currently performs at a baseline level of zero accuracy, indicating no functional capability. The trend is, therefore, either declining (if previous iterations showed any promise) or stable at zero.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system is given clear instructions and constraints for the scheduling task.\n2.  The prompt includes the necessary information to solve the scheduling problems, such as participant schedules, meeting durations, and time preferences.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system consistently fails to extract meeting information from the provided text, leading to the inability to propose a valid meeting time.\n2.  The system lacks robustness in handling variations in input text and complex constraints.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The inability to accurately and reliably extract key details (participant names, schedules, constraints) from the input text is the primary bottleneck.\n2.  **Constraint Handling:** Because information extraction fails, constraint handling is never reached, meaning it is unknown whether that would work or not.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **\"Could not extract meeting information\"**: This generic error message appears in all error cases, indicating a consistent failure at the initial information extraction stage.\n2.  **Inability to Handle Multiple Constraints:** The problems involve multiple participants with varying schedules and preferences, which might overwhelm the current extraction and reasoning capabilities.\n3. **Limited Reasoning Depth:** The system likely relies on surface-level pattern matching instead of deep semantic understanding and reasoning to infer availabilities.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the failure of the **information extraction module** to reliably identify and parse participant names, their schedules, and meeting constraints from the input text. The error is not just about \"parsing,\" but about the LLM's understanding of the text's semantic structure and its ability to extract the relevant information accurately in a structured format suitable for downstream processing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the information extraction capability, focusing on the extraction of participant names, their schedules (busy times), meeting duration, and any specific constraints or preferences.\n2.  **Error Handling**: The generic \"Could not extract meeting information\" message is not helpful. Improve error handling to provide more specific and informative error messages indicating what type of information could not be extracted and why.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Refine the Information Extraction Module with LLM calls:** Implement a more robust information extraction module that uses LLM calls (rather than regex) to identify participant names, schedules, and constraints. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to break down the extraction process, such as:\n    *   \"First, identify all the participants in the meeting.\"\n    *   \"Next, for each participant, extract their busy times on each day.\"\n    *   \"Finally, identify any additional constraints or preferences mentioned in the text.\"\n    *   Structure the extracted information into a structured format (e.g., JSON). For example:\n```json\n{\n    \"participants\": [\"Raymond\", \"Sophia\", \"Lori\", \"Dorothy\"],\n    \"duration\": \"half an hour\",\n    \"days\": [\"Monday\"],\n    \"work_hours\": [\"9:00\", \"17:00\"],\n    \"schedules\": {\n        \"Raymond\": {\"Monday\": [\"9:30-10:00\", \"12:30-14:30\", \"15:30-16:00\"]},\n        \"Sophia\": {\"Monday\": []},\n        \"Lori\": {\"Monday\": [\"9:00-9:30\", \"10:30-13:00\", \"14:30-15:00\", \"15:30-17:00\"]},\n        \"Dorothy\": {\"Monday\": [\"9:00-13:30\", \"14:00-15:00\", \"16:00-16:30\"]}\n    },\n    \"preferences\": {}\n}\n```\n2. **Implement Data Validation with LLM-based Verification:** Implement a separate validation step after information extraction. This step uses an LLM to verify the extracted information against the original text. The LLM should check:\n    *  Completeness: Are all participants and their schedules extracted?\n    *  Consistency: Are there any conflicting or illogical time slots?\n    *  Accuracy: Does the extracted information accurately reflect the text?\n    * If the validation step identifies errors, it should trigger a re-extraction process with more focused prompts.\n\n3.  **Use a specialized agent for parsing:** Create a parsing agent that takes in the original question and extracts all relevant information. This agent is specifically responsible for identifying participants, constraints, and schedules, and outputting a structured representation of this data. An example would be json as in suggestion 1.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates extremely limited capability in scheduling tasks, achieving zero accuracy across the test samples. Its primary deficiency lies in reliably extracting necessary information from the provided text. While the system receives clear instructions and has sufficient input data, its inability to parse and understand the text's structure prevents it from progressing to subsequent stages of the scheduling process. The system is effectively non-functional for the intended purpose.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Task Definition:** The system benefits from a well-defined task and explicit instructions.\n2.  **Sufficient Input Data:** The prompts provide all the information needed to solve the scheduling problems.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Failure:** The consistent inability to accurately extract participant names, schedules, and constraints from text renders the system useless.\n2.  **Error Message Vagueness:** Generic error messages hinder debugging and targeted improvement.\n3.  **Constraint Handling Untested:** The failure to extract information prevents evaluation of constraint handling capabilities.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Information Extraction:** Improving the accuracy and robustness of information extraction is paramount. Without reliable information extraction, no other scheduling functionalities can be tested or improved.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   Replace the existing parsing mechanism (likely regex-based, which is not working) with an LLM-based approach.\n    *   Develop a function that uses chain-of-thought prompting to guide the LLM to extract relevant information (participants, schedules, duration, constraints).\n    *   The extracted information should be structured into a standard format like JSON (as per the previous suggestion).\n    *   Example LLM call:\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_info(text):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            Analyze the following text to extract information for scheduling a meeting. Identify:\n            1. The names of all participants.\n            2. For each participant, their busy times on each day.  Include the day.\n            3. The desired duration of the meeting.\n            4. Any other constraints or preferences mentioned.\n\n            Present the output in JSON format:\n            {{\n                \"participants\": [\"name1\", \"name2\", ...],\n                \"duration\": \"...\",\n                \"constraints\": \"...\",\n                \"schedules\": {{\n                    \"name1\": {{\"Monday\": [\"time1\", \"time2\"], \"Tuesday\": [...]}},\n                    \"name2\": {{\"Monday\": [...], \"Tuesday\": [...]}},\n                    ...\n                }}\n            }}\n\n            Text: {text}\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n            try:\n                return json.loads(response)\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                return None # Handle JSON parsing errors\n        ```\n\n2.  **Implement LLM-Driven Data Validation:**\n    *   Create a `verify_extracted_info` function that takes the original text and the extracted JSON data as input.\n    *   This function uses an LLM call to check the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the extracted data against the source text.\n    *   If discrepancies are found, log detailed error messages and trigger re-extraction (potentially with more specific prompts).\n    * Example LLM call:\n        ```python\n        def verify_extracted_info(text, extracted_data):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are a data validation expert. Analyze the following text and the corresponding extracted information (in JSON format). Verify that the extracted information is complete, accurate, and consistent with the original text.\n\n            Text: {text}\n\n            Extracted Information (JSON):\n            {json.dumps(extracted_data)}\n\n            Specifically, check the following:\n            1. Are all participants mentioned in the text included in the 'participants' list?\n            2. For each participant, does the 'schedules' section accurately reflect their busy times as stated in the text?  Are the days correct?\n            3. Does the 'duration' field match the meeting duration specified in the text?\n            4. Are any other constraints or preferences mentioned in the text accurately represented in the 'constraints' field?\n            5. Are there any illogical time slots that don't make sense?\n\n            Provide a detailed report of any discrepancies or errors found. If everything is accurate return \"No Issues Found\".\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n            return response  # The response will contain the verification report or \"No Issues Found\"\n        ```\n\n3.  **Improve Error Handling:**\n    *   Instead of a generic \"Could not extract meeting information\" message, implement more specific error handling within the `extract_meeting_info` function.\n    *   If `json.loads()` fails, log a specific error indicating a JSON parsing problem.\n    *   If the LLM returns an empty or incomplete JSON object, log an error indicating which information is missing (e.g., \"Could not extract participants' names\").\n\n4. **Create a Parsing Agent**:\n    * Create a distinct parsing agent responsible for extracting relevant information.\n    * Feed it with the original question/problem and design it to output a structured data representation (e.g., JSON).\n    * Ensure this agent handles variations in input format and constraints.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining/Stable:** The system currently performs at a baseline level of zero accuracy, indicating no functional capability. The trend is, therefore, either declining (if previous iterations showed any promise) or stable at zero.\n"

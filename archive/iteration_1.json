  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with question decomposition and verification steps to answer a question. The problem is decomposed into sub-questions, then relevant information is extracted, and finally, an answer is synthesized. Three agent roles are used: question decomposer, information extraction expert, and answer synthesis expert, each implemented through specific prompts to the LLM. The functions used are `main` which orchestrates the process, `decompose_question` which breaks down the question, `extract_information` which gathers relevant information, `synthesize_answer` which formulates the final answer, and `call_llm` which interfaces with the Gemini API; these functions are called sequentially to solve the problem. The overall workflow is to decompose, extract, and synthesize, with validation steps at each stage to ensure correctness.",

Ideally, we'd want to extract the answer directly without the start/end markers for easier downstream processing.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates strong capability in extracting numerical information from text passages when the answer is explicitly stated. It successfully extracts numerical values, including those with percentage signs and commas, and can perform basic arithmetic. However, its capabilities are limited to direct extraction and simple calculations.  It lacks the capacity for more complex reasoning, contextual understanding, and inference. The observed performance is excellent on a very narrow task, which makes it difficult to generalize about overall capability. The assessment is that the system can *find* but perhaps not *understand* the answer.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Precise Numerical Extraction:** Highly accurate extraction of numerical data, a critical capability.\n*   **Format Handling:** Ability to handle minor variations in numerical formatting (commas, percentage signs).\n* **Basic Arithmetic Functionality**: Demonstrates an ability to perform simple arithmetic.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Complex Reasoning:** Inability to handle multi-step calculations or logical inferences.\n*   **Contextual Blindness:** Difficulty with questions requiring understanding of units, conversions, or implied information.\n* **Over-reliance on Direct Extraction**: This is the most critical weakness. The system may struggle with problems that involve any kind of information synthesis or inference.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **complex reasoning and inference**.  The system needs to move beyond direct extraction and be able to *understand* the information and use it to solve problems. This requires integrating a more sophisticated reasoning module.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Reasoning Sub-system:** Design and integrate a reasoning sub-system that can parse the extracted numerical data and use it to perform arithmetic operations and logical deductions.\n\n    *   **Technical Steps:**\n        *   Develop a parser to convert the extracted text into numerical values and units (if present).\n        *   Implement arithmetic operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) within the reasoning module.\n        *   Design a rule-based or neural network-based inference engine to deduce implicit information.\n2.  **Develop a more robust context processor:** Develop a module that uses external knowledge to help infer relationships and facts that are not explicitly stated in the passage.\n\n    *   **Technical Steps:**\n        *   Augment the system with a knowledge base (e.g., a subset of Wikidata or ConceptNet) to represent relationships between concepts and units.\n        *   Develop a method for the system to query this knowledge base based on the extracted information.\n3. **Expand the Training Dataset**: Include complex questions that require multi-step reasoning.\n\n    *   **Technical Steps:**\n        *   Create a training set with questions that require numerical extraction and simple arithmetic.\n        *   Curate a dataset with questions that require multi-step reasoning and inference.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the very limited data, it is difficult to assess a capability trend.  The system is currently performing at its maximum potential *for the specific, narrow task it was evaluated on*.  To assess trends, the system needs to be evaluated on a broader range of tasks, *especially those designed to test its reasoning abilities*.  Therefore, the current assessment is **stable, but potentially misleadingly so.** A broader assessment is needed to determine if the system is truly improving or simply overfitting to a very specific type of problem.\n",

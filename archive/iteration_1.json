  "approach_summary": "This script uses LLMs to extract scheduling constraints, verify the extracted data, and find available time slots by using chain-of-thought reasoning. The `extract_data_and_verify` function extracts information and validates it, while the `find_available_time_slots` function determines suitable meeting times based on the extracted constraints. The overall workflow involves calling the LLM to extract data, and then calling the LLM again to find an available time.\n\nThe main function calls the functions `extract_data_and_verify` to parse the user's input to extract data. Then `find_available_time_slots` is called to use the data to determine the best time to meet and return it to the user.",

The system acknowledges the difficulty of finding a valid meeting time when it cannot find one.\n3. The prompt engineering effectively sets the stage for meeting scheduling tasks.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system frequently fails to find valid meeting times, even when a solution exists according to the golden answer.\n2.  The system lacks robustness in handling multiple constraints and participant schedules simultaneously.\n3. The system does not seem to prioritize or effectively incorporate preferences such as days or times a participant would rather not meet.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Constraint handling:** The primary bottleneck appears to be the system's inability to efficiently and accurately process a large number of constraints from multiple participants' schedules. This leads to missed valid meeting times.\n2.  **Solution verification:** Even if the system generates potential solutions, the verification process may be flawed, incorrectly rejecting valid options or failing to identify and eliminate invalid options based on the constraints.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **False Negatives:** The dominant pattern is the system's failure to identify valid meeting times that exist based on the golden answers. This suggests either the solution generation is not exhaustive or that the solution verification is too strict.\n2.  **Multiple Participants:** The errors occur when there are multiple participants, exacerbating the difficulty of juggling complex schedules and preferences.\n3.  **Preference Neglect:** Preferences (e.g., \"Douglas do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30\") are likely not being adequately incorporated, potentially leading to the exclusion of valid solutions.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inaccurate simultaneous evaluation of multiple, complex constraints**. The system struggles to correctly assess the combined impact of all participant schedules and preferences when determining valid meeting slots, leading to the frequent \"Could not find a valid meeting time\" errors, despite valid options existing.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint handling:** Enhance the system's ability to parse and represent time constraints efficiently. Consider representing time constraints with a data structure that facilitates intersection calculations (e.g., interval trees or boolean arrays).\n2.  **Solution Generation and Verification:** Improve the solution generation to create potential solutions which satisfy the maximum amount of constraints possible. Also, Improve solution verification to ensure accurate constraint adherence by incorporating constraint priorities (hard constraints, preferences).\n3.  **LLM Parsing and Abstraction:** Strengthen the LLM's ability to extract constraints more accurately and to abstract time intervals into a more readily usable data structure for downstream constraint solving.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Interval Tree Representation:** Instead of string-based time comparisons, represent each person's availability as a set of time intervals, utilizing interval trees for efficient intersection checks. An interval tree allows quick identification of overlapping intervals, representing conflicts.\n2.  **Constraint Categorization and Prioritization:** The LLM should extract \"hard constraints\" (mandatory restrictions like existing meetings) and \"soft constraints\" (preferences like not meeting after a certain time). Prioritize hard constraints in the verification process. Only propose solutions that meet hard constraints.\n3.  **Hybrid Approach with Python and LLM:** Use the LLM to extract and classify the time intervals and preference information, and use Python code to perform the actual interval intersection calculations and constraint checking.  The LLM focuses on understanding and parsing, and Python handles the deterministic calculations.\n4.  **Solution Verification Agent:** Implement a dedicated \"solution verification agent\" that explicitly checks each proposed meeting time against all extracted constraints, logging which constraints are met or violated. This allows for easier debugging and identification of flawed verification logic.\n5.  **Chain-of-Thought Refinement:** Use chain-of-thought prompting to have the LLM explicitly reason about each constraint and its impact on potential meeting times. For example: \"Douglas is unavailable Wednesday 12:30-13:00. Therefore, a meeting cannot occur during that period.\"\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful, but likely missed a free slot.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (no solution generated)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (incorrectly determined no solution was possible).\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful, but preferences were not incorporated.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed to account for preferences.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (no solution generated)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (incorrectly determined no solution was possible).\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful, but likely missed a free slot.\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed.\n    *   solution_generation: Failed.\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (no solution generated)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (incorrectly determined no solution was possible).\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, and improvement suggestions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently possesses a limited capability for scheduling meetings, demonstrating some rudimentary understanding of constraints but failing to accurately identify valid meeting times in many scenarios. The system's accuracy of 40% indicates significant room for improvement. While the prompt engineering seems effective in framing the task, the core logic for constraint handling and solution verification needs substantial enhancement. The system is currently unreliable for practical meeting scheduling purposes.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Prompt Engineering Foundation:** The established prompt engineering provides a good starting point for defining the scheduling task.\n*   **Basic Constraint Acknowledgment:** The system recognizes the existence of constraints and attempts to factor them into scheduling decisions, although unsuccessfully in many cases.\n*   **Recognition of Failure:** The system acknowledges when it cannot find a valid meeting time, which prevents it from providing incorrect solutions.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The most critical weakness is the system's inability to accurately and simultaneously process multiple constraints, leading to missed valid meeting times.\n*   **Ineffective Solution Verification:** The solution verification process is likely flawed, leading to the rejection of valid meeting times and the potential acceptance of invalid ones.\n*   **Preference Neglect:** The system fails to adequately incorporate user preferences (soft constraints) into the scheduling process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**. Improving the system's ability to accurately and efficiently process multiple constraints is crucial for increasing its overall accuracy and reliability. This includes accurately extracting all types of constraints and prioritizing them appropriately during solution generation and verification.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Hybrid Approach for Constraint Handling:**\n    *   **LLM for Extraction & Classification:** Use the LLM to extract all relevant time intervals and classify them as either \"hard\" (mandatory) or \"soft\" (preference) constraints. Pay special attention to complex phrasing, such as \"Douglas do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30.\" Focus on accurate information extraction, even if that extraction is given to another agent.\n    *   **Python for Processing & Calculation:** Implement Python code to represent each participant's availability as a set of time intervals. Use an interval tree data structure, or similar, to efficiently check for overlapping intervals (conflicts). Perform the actual interval intersection calculations and constraint checking in Python.\n2.  **Develop a Solution Verification Agent:**\n    *   Create a dedicated \"solution verification agent\" that explicitly checks each proposed meeting time against *all* extracted constraints, both hard and soft.\n    *   The verification agent should log which constraints are met, which are violated, and the severity of each violation.\n    *   Hard constraints *must* be satisfied for a meeting time to be valid. Soft constraints should be used as tie-breakers to rank solutions.\n3.  **Refine Solution Generation with Preference Consideration:**\n    *   Modify the solution generation process to prioritize meeting times that satisfy the maximum number of soft constraints *after* ensuring all hard constraints are met.\n    *   Use chain-of-thought prompting within the LLM to explicitly reason about the impact of each constraint on potential meeting times. This should happen *before* attempting to generate a schedule. An example of chain-of-thought reasoning would be \"Douglas is unavailable Wednesday 12:30-13:00. Therefore, a meeting cannot occur during that period.\"\n4. **Rely on LLM calls over brittle regex**\n    *   Make sure that the extraction of preferences, constraint, names, and other entities is done by LLM calls to extract_information or other calls\n    *   Do not depend on being able to split the input string and apply complex regexes to parse entities.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance and error analysis, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but low**. Without significant improvements to constraint handling and solution verification, the system will remain unreliable and of limited practical use. Implementing the recommendations above should lead to a **significant upward trend** in capabilities in the next iteration. If recommendations are not implemented, expect the trend to be **declining** as edge cases or different inputs exploit the same weaknesses.\n",

    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a capability assessment of the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, and improvement suggestions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently possesses a limited capability for scheduling meetings, demonstrating some rudimentary understanding of constraints but failing to accurately identify valid meeting times in many scenarios. The system's accuracy of 40% indicates significant room for improvement. While the prompt engineering seems effective in framing the task, the core logic for constraint handling and solution verification needs substantial enhancement. The system is currently unreliable for practical meeting scheduling purposes.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Prompt Engineering Foundation:** The established prompt engineering provides a good starting point for defining the scheduling task.\n*   **Basic Constraint Acknowledgment:** The system recognizes the existence of constraints and attempts to factor them into scheduling decisions, although unsuccessfully in many cases.\n*   **Recognition of Failure:** The system acknowledges when it cannot find a valid meeting time, which prevents it from providing incorrect solutions.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The most critical weakness is the system's inability to accurately and simultaneously process multiple constraints, leading to missed valid meeting times.\n*   **Ineffective Solution Verification:** The solution verification process is likely flawed, leading to the rejection of valid meeting times and the potential acceptance of invalid ones.\n*   **Preference Neglect:** The system fails to adequately incorporate user preferences (soft constraints) into the scheduling process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Handling**. Improving the system's ability to accurately and efficiently process multiple constraints is crucial for increasing its overall accuracy and reliability. This includes accurately extracting all types of constraints and prioritizing them appropriately during solution generation and verification.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Hybrid Approach for Constraint Handling:**\n    *   **LLM for Extraction & Classification:** Use the LLM to extract all relevant time intervals and classify them as either \"hard\" (mandatory) or \"soft\" (preference) constraints. Pay special attention to complex phrasing, such as \"Douglas do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30.\" Focus on accurate information extraction, even if that extraction is given to another agent.\n    *   **Python for Processing & Calculation:** Implement Python code to represent each participant's availability as a set of time intervals. Use an interval tree data structure, or similar, to efficiently check for overlapping intervals (conflicts). Perform the actual interval intersection calculations and constraint checking in Python.\n2.  **Develop a Solution Verification Agent:**\n    *   Create a dedicated \"solution verification agent\" that explicitly checks each proposed meeting time against *all* extracted constraints, both hard and soft.\n    *   The verification agent should log which constraints are met, which are violated, and the severity of each violation.\n    *   Hard constraints *must* be satisfied for a meeting time to be valid. Soft constraints should be used as tie-breakers to rank solutions.\n3.  **Refine Solution Generation with Preference Consideration:**\n    *   Modify the solution generation process to prioritize meeting times that satisfy the maximum number of soft constraints *after* ensuring all hard constraints are met.\n    *   Use chain-of-thought prompting within the LLM to explicitly reason about the impact of each constraint on potential meeting times. This should happen *before* attempting to generate a schedule. An example of chain-of-thought reasoning would be \"Douglas is unavailable Wednesday 12:30-13:00. Therefore, a meeting cannot occur during that period.\"\n4. **Rely on LLM calls over brittle regex**\n    *   Make sure that the extraction of preferences, constraint, names, and other entities is done by LLM calls to extract_information or other calls\n    *   Do not depend on being able to split the input string and apply complex regexes to parse entities.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance and error analysis, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but low**. Without significant improvements to constraint handling and solution verification, the system will remain unreliable and of limited practical use. Implementing the recommendations above should lead to a **significant upward trend** in capabilities in the next iteration. If recommendations are not implemented, expect the trend to be **declining** as edge cases or different inputs exploit the same weaknesses.\n"

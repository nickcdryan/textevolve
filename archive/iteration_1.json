  "approach_summary": "The script solves questions using a chain-of-thought approach with multiple LLM calls to `call_llm`: first, to understand the question, then to devise a plan, and finally to execute the plan. The `extract_answer_from_solution` function uses an LLM call to extract the final answer from the execution output. The `solve_question` function orchestrates this process, and the `main` function serves as the entry point. The overall workflow is to decompose the question into understanding, planning, and execution phases, using LLM to generate responses at each stage.",

Call ListModels to see the list of available models and their supported methods.\"\n\nThis indicates that the system is attempting to use the `gemini-pro` model via the `v1beta` API, but this model is either unavailable or not supported through that specific API endpoint. This is a critical infrastructure problem that prevents the system from functioning correctly because the LLM calls are failing.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Problem Definition:** The system has a well-defined task (scheduling meetings) and is given structured input (participant schedules, constraints).\n2.  **Modular Task Decomposition:** The problem is presented as requiring information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, and solution verification, which is a reasonable approach to the overall task.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **LLM API Dependency & Error Handling:** The system relies heavily on external LLM APIs and crashes when these APIs are unavailable or misconfigured, with the \"404\" error indicating a complete breakdown in communication. Error handling seems insufficient to recover or use alternative models when the primary model fails.\n2.  **Constraint Satisfaction:** The system fails consistently to generate meeting schedules that satisfy the given constraints, evidenced by the \"None\" answers when valid schedules exist according to the golden answers.\n3.  **Absence of Reasoning Trace:** The outputs lack intermediate reasoning steps or debugging information, making it difficult to understand *why* the system fails to find a valid schedule. The system provides a 'None' output without insight.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **LLM API Failure:** The inability to access the LLM (due to the 404 error) is the most critical bottleneck, completely halting the system's operation.\n2.  **Inability to solve the Constraints:** Even if the LLM API were available, there is no evidence of a working solution.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent LLM API Failure:** The same 404 error occurs across all samples, suggesting a systemic issue with LLM configuration.\n2.  **'None' Output:** In all error cases, the system returns \"None,\" implying a complete failure to find any viable solution. This suggests either the LLM isn't even attempting to find a solution due to the 404, or is unable to correctly find a solution in any instance.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **inability to access the specified LLM API endpoint (`gemini-pro` via `v1beta`)**, resulting in a complete system failure. Without a working LLM connection, the rest of the scheduling logic is useless.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Robust Error Handling & Fallbacks:** Implement comprehensive error handling around LLM API calls, including retries, fallback to alternative models, and graceful degradation strategies.\n2.  **API Version Management:** Ensure the API version used (`v1beta`) is correct and supported.\n3.  **Constraint Satisfaction Algorithms:** Develop more robust algorithms for identifying valid meeting times based on the given constraints. Consider methods beyond direct LLM generation, potentially integrating programmatic constraint solvers.\n4.  **Reasoning Traceability:** Log intermediate reasoning steps, constraint evaluations, and solution attempts to enable better debugging and analysis.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Verify API Endpoint & Model Availability:** Double-check the LLM API endpoint, model name (`gemini-pro`), and supported API version. Ensure the necessary credentials and permissions are correctly configured. Use the `ListModels` API to ensure the model exists and is supported.\n2.  **Implement LLM API Error Handling with Fallbacks:**\n    *   Wrap LLM API calls in `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions (e.g., `HTTPError`, `Timeout`).\n    *   Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient API errors.\n    *   If the primary model (`gemini-pro`) is unavailable, fallback to a secondary model (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`) and log the event.\n3.  **Implement Programmatic Constraint Solver:** Develop a deterministic function to check if a proposed meeting time satisfies all participant schedules and constraints. This function could be used to verify candidate solutions generated by the LLM or to generate potential solutions directly.\n4.  **Add Logging for Reasoning Steps:** Modify the code to log the following information:\n    *   Extracted participant schedules\n    *   Identified constraints\n    *   Candidate meeting times considered\n    *   Constraint check results for each candidate time\n    *   Reason for selecting or rejecting a candidate time\n5.  **Refine LLM Prompting for Constraint Satisfaction:** If using the LLM to generate candidate meeting times, refine the prompt to explicitly emphasize the importance of satisfying all constraints. Include examples of valid and invalid schedules.\n6.  **Implement Output Verification and Re-generation:** Implement a feedback loop where the initial LLM-generated solution is programmatically verified for constraint satisfaction. If constraints are violated, regenerate the solution with specific feedback about the violations.\n7. **Constraint Handling Improvements:** Refine the system to better process and store the constraints.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to LLM error).\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to LLM error).\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to LLM error).\n*   **Sample 3:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to LLM error).\n*   **Sample 4:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to LLM error).\n",

This error occurs in every sample, indicating a fundamental problem with the system's configuration or ability to access the LLM service. The consistent \"None\" output suggests that no part of the scheduling logic beyond the failed LLM call is being executed. The error reporting also repeats the 404 error multiple times within the same output line, suggesting perhaps repeated failed attempts to call the LLM without proper exit conditions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has **zero** functional capabilities due to its inability to access the specified LLM. The core scheduling logic is entirely dependent on the LLM and cannot function without a successful API call. The system demonstrates a basic understanding of task decomposition, but this is irrelevant until the LLM connectivity issue is resolved.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The problem is well-defined, which is a good starting point.\n*   **Modular Task Decomposition (Conceptual):** The system (at least in its design) breaks the problem into logical modules (information extraction, etc.).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Critical LLM API Dependency:** The system relies entirely on a single, unavailable LLM model, leading to complete failure.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The error handling is insufficient to recover from LLM API failures, even to the point of identifying or logging the specific model name causing the error.\n*   **No Fallback Mechanism:** There's no mechanism to switch to a different LLM model if the primary one is unavailable.\n*   **Absence of Functional Core Logic:** The core scheduling logic is completely dependent on the LLM, with no independent code for solving the problem in case of API failure.\n* **Inadequate error handling**: The system throws an error, but it does not provide the user with the details of the error.\n* **Lack of Solution Validation and Feedback:** The current implementation lacks a validation step to assess the LLM response and/or programmatic checking of the solution to determine whether the suggested schedule satisfies all the constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary improvement focus must be on **Robust LLM API Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms**. Without this, the system is completely unusable.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Verify and Correct LLM API Endpoint Configuration:** Immediately verify the correctness of the API endpoint URL, model name (`gemini-pro`), API version (`v1beta`), and authentication credentials. Use the LLM provider's API explorer or a simple test script to confirm basic connectivity to the LLM service. If `gemini-pro` is unavailable on `v1beta`, either use a different model, or upgrade the API version.\n2.  **Implement LLM API Error Handling with Retry and Fallback:**\n    *   Wrap LLM API calls in `try...except` blocks to catch `HTTPError`, `Timeout`, and other potential exceptions. Log the specific exception details (including the model name) to aid debugging.\n    *   Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient API errors. Limit the number of retry attempts to prevent infinite loops.\n    *   Implement a fallback mechanism to switch to a different LLM model if the primary model is unavailable. Use a configuration setting to define a list of fallback models and their respective API keys.\n    * Implement a validation step and implement feedback to the LLM with each retry.\n3.  **Implement Programmatic Constraint Solver (Minimum Viable Product):** Develop a *basic* deterministic function (e.g., in Python) to check if a proposed meeting time satisfies a *subset* of the constraints (e.g., checking for double-booking of a single participant). This is a minimum viable product to allow some functionality even without the LLM. This will require refactoring to pass participant schedules as parsable data.\n4. **Improve error reporting**: Add logging to provide the user with details on what went wrong in case of an error.\n5. **Check whether a solution exists.** Modify the prompts and the code to determine if a feasible solution exists given the constraints before asking the LLM to provide a suggested time.\n6.  **Simplify the system**: For the purposes of debugging, simplify the system by reducing the number of components involved and ensuring that the remaining parts are operational.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining**. The system is currently non-functional, representing a decline from any previous state. Without immediate action to address the LLM connectivity issue, the trend will remain negative.\n```",

Consider methods beyond direct LLM generation, potentially integrating programmatic constraint solvers.\n4.  **Reasoning Traceability:** Log intermediate reasoning steps, constraint evaluations, and solution attempts to enable better debugging and analysis.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Verify API Endpoint & Model Availability:** Double-check the LLM API endpoint, model name (`gemini-pro`), and supported API version. Ensure the necessary credentials and permissions are correctly configured. Use the `ListModels` API to ensure the model exists and is supported.\n2.  **Implement LLM API Error Handling with Fallbacks:**\n    *   Wrap LLM API calls in `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions (e.g., `HTTPError`, `Timeout`).\n    *   Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient API errors.\n    *   If the primary model (`gemini-pro`) is unavailable, fallback to a secondary model (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`) and log the event.\n3.  **Implement Programmatic Constraint Solver:** Develop a deterministic function to check if a proposed meeting time satisfies all participant schedules and constraints. This function could be used to verify candidate solutions generated by the LLM or to generate potential solutions directly.\n4.  **Add Logging for Reasoning Steps:** Modify the code to log the following information:\n    *   Extracted participant schedules\n    *   Identified constraints\n    *   Candidate meeting times considered\n    *   Constraint check results for each candidate time\n    *   Reason for selecting or rejecting a candidate time\n5.  **Refine LLM Prompting for Constraint Satisfaction:** If using the LLM to generate candidate meeting times, refine the prompt to explicitly emphasize the importance of satisfying all constraints. Include examples of valid and invalid schedules.\n6.  **Implement Output Verification and Re-generation:** Implement a feedback loop where the initial LLM-generated solution is programmatically verified for constraint satisfaction. If constraints are violated, regenerate the solution with specific feedback about the violations.\n7. **Constraint Handling Improvements:** Refine the system to better process and store the constraints.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to LLM error).\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to LLM error).\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to LLM error).\n*   **Sample 3:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to LLM error).\n*   **Sample 4:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to LLM error).\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to LLM error).\n",
    "capability_report_text": "```markdown\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs consistently show a \"404\" error when calling the LLM, specifically for the `gemini-pro` model using the `v1beta` API. This error occurs in every sample, indicating a fundamental problem with the system's configuration or ability to access the LLM service. The consistent \"None\" output suggests that no part of the scheduling logic beyond the failed LLM call is being executed. The error reporting also repeats the 404 error multiple times within the same output line, suggesting perhaps repeated failed attempts to call the LLM without proper exit conditions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has **zero** functional capabilities due to its inability to access the specified LLM. The core scheduling logic is entirely dependent on the LLM and cannot function without a successful API call. The system demonstrates a basic understanding of task decomposition, but this is irrelevant until the LLM connectivity issue is resolved.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Clear Problem Definition:** The problem is well-defined, which is a good starting point.\n*   **Modular Task Decomposition (Conceptual):** The system (at least in its design) breaks the problem into logical modules (information extraction, etc.).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Critical LLM API Dependency:** The system relies entirely on a single, unavailable LLM model, leading to complete failure.\n*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The error handling is insufficient to recover from LLM API failures, even to the point of identifying or logging the specific model name causing the error.\n*   **No Fallback Mechanism:** There's no mechanism to switch to a different LLM model if the primary one is unavailable.\n*   **Absence of Functional Core Logic:** The core scheduling logic is completely dependent on the LLM, with no independent code for solving the problem in case of API failure.\n* **Inadequate error handling**: The system throws an error, but it does not provide the user with the details of the error.\n* **Lack of Solution Validation and Feedback:** The current implementation lacks a validation step to assess the LLM response and/or programmatic checking of the solution to determine whether the suggested schedule satisfies all the constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary improvement focus must be on **Robust LLM API Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms**. Without this, the system is completely unusable.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Verify and Correct LLM API Endpoint Configuration:** Immediately verify the correctness of the API endpoint URL, model name (`gemini-pro`), API version (`v1beta`), and authentication credentials. Use the LLM provider's API explorer or a simple test script to confirm basic connectivity to the LLM service. If `gemini-pro` is unavailable on `v1beta`, either use a different model, or upgrade the API version.\n2.  **Implement LLM API Error Handling with Retry and Fallback:**\n    *   Wrap LLM API calls in `try...except` blocks to catch `HTTPError`, `Timeout`, and other potential exceptions. Log the specific exception details (including the model name) to aid debugging.\n    *   Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient API errors. Limit the number of retry attempts to prevent infinite loops.\n    *   Implement a fallback mechanism to switch to a different LLM model if the primary model is unavailable. Use a configuration setting to define a list of fallback models and their respective API keys.\n    * Implement a validation step and implement feedback to the LLM with each retry.\n3.  **Implement Programmatic Constraint Solver (Minimum Viable Product):** Develop a *basic* deterministic function (e.g., in Python) to check if a proposed meeting time satisfies a *subset* of the constraints (e.g., checking for double-booking of a single participant). This is a minimum viable product to allow some functionality even without the LLM. This will require refactoring to pass participant schedules as parsable data.\n4. **Improve error reporting**: Add logging to provide the user with details on what went wrong in case of an error.\n5. **Check whether a solution exists.** Modify the prompts and the code to determine if a feasible solution exists given the constraints before asking the LLM to provide a suggested time.\n6.  **Simplify the system**: For the purposes of debugging, simplify the system by reducing the number of components involved and ensuring that the remaining parts are operational.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\n**Declining**. The system is currently non-functional, representing a decline from any previous state. Without immediate action to address the LLM connectivity issue, the trend will remain negative.\n```"

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting constraints from the input question using the `extract_meeting_constraints` function, then finding an available time slot using the `find_available_time` function, and finally verifying the proposed solution using the `verify_solution` function; each of these steps use the `call_llm` function. The core workflow involves extracting relevant information, generating a potential solution, and verifying its correctness through a series of LLM calls that act as specialized agents. The `call_llm` function handles the interaction with the Gemini API, providing a unified way to access LLM capabilities.",

Here are a few example tasks and solutions:\n\nTASK: You need to schedule a meeting for Ryan and Kenneth for half an hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday. \n\nHere are the existing schedules for everyone during the day: \nRyan is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 14:30 to 15:00, 16:00 to 16:30; \nKenneth is busy on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 11:00 to 12:00, 12:30 to 13:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 14:30 to 16:30; \n\nThe group would like to meet at their earlist availability.\nFind a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints. \nSOLUTION: "

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment of the AI system, incorporating the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a critical and consistent issue: The system frequently fails to find a valid meeting time, even when one should exist based on the problem description.\n\n*   **Output 1 and 3 (\"Could not find a valid meeting time\"):** These outputs confirm the primary weakness identified in the error analysis \u2013 the inability to generate valid solutions. The system gives up searching for a time.\n*   **Output 2 (\"Here is the proposed time: Monday, 11:00 - 11:30\"):** This output represents a *potential* success, but without further information about the input problem for this case, we can't confirm its validity. Critically, we need to verify if this proposed time *actually* meets all constraints. Given the other failures, there's a significant chance this proposed time is incorrect, violating at least one constraint, and thus not validated by any verification step.\n\nThe fact that the system *sometimes* proposes a time (Output 2) is interesting. It suggests the constraint solver *can* function, but either the conditions for its success are very narrow, or there's a lack of proper integration and validation with constraint logic.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system exhibits a *very* limited capability for scheduling meetings. While it demonstrates a basic understanding of the problem's components (participants, schedules, constraints), its core functionality - generating valid meeting times that satisfy all constraints - is severely flawed. The accuracy score (0.40) reflects this low level of effectiveness. Given the high error rate and lack of concrete validation, the actual capability is likely worse than that score suggests, closer to the 0.  The inconsistent outputs suggest instability or sensitivity to specific input conditions.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Problem Decomposition & Constraint Awareness (Potential):**  *If* output 2 is to be believed, the system can sometimes handle constraints.  This is only a *potential* strength because it's not consistently demonstrated. This needs further investigation. If the algorithm CAN sometimes create a solution, but fails in its general application, this could suggest a flawed combination with other aspects of the system.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Solution Generation (CRITICAL):** The system's inability to reliably generate valid meeting times is the primary and most severe weakness.\n*   **Constraint Handling (CRITICAL):** The system consistently fails to integrate constraints effectively from multiple participants.\n*    **Solution Verification:** A consistent weakness is that it does NOT ensure that the proposed meeting time truly satisfies all given constraints.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\n**Solution Generation AND Verification**\nBecause a major problem is generating correct meeting times, and the system doesn't make sure that generated times are correct, I recommend that solution generation AND verification be worked on in tandem. The problem could be because the constraints that inform solution generation are flawed, or it could be that the logic that determines whether a solution is valid is flawed.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Implement a ReAct Pattern for Solution Generation AND Verification:**  Integrate the ReAct pattern within the scheduling algorithm. This allows the system to *reason* about the constraints, *act* by proposing a potential meeting time, *observe* if the constraints are satisfied, and then *react* by either refining the solution or backtracking if necessary. This should involve the following steps:\n\n    *   **Reason:** Analyze the current state of the schedule, identify available time slots, and determine the constraints for each participant.\n    *   **Act:** Propose a potential meeting time based on the analysis.\n    *   **Observe:** Verify if the proposed time satisfies all constraints. If there are conflicts, identify the specific constraints that are violated.\n    *   **React:** If there are conflicts, refine the proposed time by shifting it to a different slot or adjusting the duration. If necessary, backtrack and try a different initial time slot.\n    *   **Iterate:** Repeat the Reason-Act-Observe-React cycle until a valid meeting time is found or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n\n2.  **Add Detailed Constraint Checking and Logging:** Implement detailed logging within the constraint handling logic. Each time a constraint is checked, log the following information:\n\n    *   Which constraint is being checked.\n    *   The values being compared.\n    *   The result of the comparison (constraint satisfied or violated).\n    *   The reason for the violation (if any).\n\n    This detailed logging will help you pinpoint exactly where and why the constraint handling is failing.  Crucially, log these events *before* and *after* proposing a meeting time.\n3.  **Develop Comprehensive Unit Tests:** Create a suite of unit tests that specifically target the constraint handling logic. These tests should cover a wide range of scenarios, including:\n\n    *   Simple cases with a few participants and basic constraints.\n    *   Complex cases with multiple participants, overlapping schedules, and conflicting preferences.\n    *   Edge cases with unusual time preferences or schedule restrictions.\n    *   Cases that should *always* produce a valid solution.\n    This will allow you to isolate and fix the issues.\n\n4.  **Falsification Testing:** Create tests where it is impossible to satisfy constraints to test cases where an answer cannot be found. These test results must be distinguishable from valid cases where there is an error that fails to produce a solution.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the provided information, the capability trend is currently **stable at a low level**. The system consistently fails to generate valid solutions, indicating that there's no inherent improvement over time. Without significant changes, the system will continue to perform poorly. The single \"success\" is not enough to infer an upward trend. If it is a true success, the trend would be stable/slightly improving - but further validation is needed to determine this.\n",

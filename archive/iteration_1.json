  "approach_summary": "The script implements a meeting scheduling system using a multi-agent approach. It decomposes the problem into four main stages: extracting meeting information, identifying available time slots, proposing a specific meeting time, and verifying the proposed solution, with each stage handled by a specialized LLM-powered agent. The workflow starts with the `main` function which orchestrates calls to: `extract_meeting_info`, `identify_available_time_slots`, `propose_meeting_time`, and `verify_final_solution`. These functions create prompts for the `call_LLM` function to extract, identify, propose, and verify. The `call_LLM` function communicates with the Gemini API to execute the prompts and returns the response.",

It's parsing the text input effectively.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Lack of complete reasoning chain**: The model states which attendees are free at a certain time. It does not output what the time is. It appears that the model stops after determining availability for some attendees, rather than outputting the suggested meeting time. The LLM isn't generating a full step-by-step chain of thought.\n2.  **Inability to commit to specific solutions**: The model is generally unable to commit to a specific proposed meeting time, instead describing the availability of certain participants.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Solution Generation**: The primary bottleneck is in generating a complete, specific proposed meeting time. The system seems to stop short of actually proposing a complete solution.\n2.  **Output Formatting:** The system does not reliably output the final answer in the required format.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe most obvious recurring pattern is that the system almost always gives information on *who* is available, but never *when*.

The model can extract constraints, but it fails to generate a complete, actionable solution and present it correctly. The LLM stops too early in its reasoning process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Solution Generation:** Enhance the solution generation component to consistently propose complete, specific meeting times.\n2.  **Output Formatting/Verification:** Implement strict output formatting and a verification step to ensure the system's output is always in the desired format (\"Here is the proposed time: ...\").\n3.  **Constraint Handling**: Expand the types of constraints that can be taken into consideration.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Refine the Prompt**:\n    *   Add explicit instructions to the prompt that the system MUST propose a meeting time, in the format \"Here is the proposed time: [Day], [Start Time] - [End Time]\".\n    *   Include examples in the prompt that show the desired output format.\n    *   Add a system prompt that states: \"You must output the meeting time.\"\n2.  **Implement a Verification Step**:\n    *   Create a verification function that checks if the system's output includes a proposed meeting time in the correct format.\n    *   If the output is not in the correct format, re-prompt the system with specific feedback on the formatting error.\n3.  **Increase Reasoning Steps**:\n    *   Force a deeper reasoning process by explicitly prompting the system to \"State the problem, list the constraints, propose several possible meeting times, eliminate times that violate the constraints, choose the best meeting time, and state the proposed time in a sentence.\"\n4.  **Few-Shot Examples**: Increase the number of few-shot examples, all with correctly formatted output.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 0**: solution_generation, decision_making, output_formatting\n*   **Sample 1**: solution_generation, decision_making, output_formatting\n*   **Sample 2**: solution_generation, decision_making, output_formatting\n*   **Sample 3**: solution_generation, decision_making, output_formatting\n*   **Sample 4**: solution_generation, decision_making, output_formatting\n",

The \"proposed time\" is only implied.\n*   **Lack of Commitment:** The system doesn't \"commit\" to a specific solution; it only presents intermediate reasoning steps. It stops *before* arriving at the final answer.\n*   **Output Format Deviation:** The required output format (\"Here is the proposed time:...\") is completely absent. The outputs only consist of analysis.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system demonstrates partial understanding of the task. It can:\n\n*   Extract relevant information (participants, constraints).\n*   Perform some level of reasoning about availability.\n*   However, it *cannot* synthesize the information into a complete, actionable solution (a proposed meeting time) and present it in the required format. The system appears to be stuck in analysis mode.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The ability to parse and incorporate participant schedules as constraints is a valuable strength.\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system is able to extract participant names and meeting constraints (duration, time, days) from the problem description, even if it fails to generate the correct final answer.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Solution Generation (Incomplete Reasoning):** The system's inability to propose a specific, complete meeting time is the most critical weakness. The system is stopping before it has finished reasoning.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The failure to adhere to the specified output format makes the system unusable.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\n*   **Solution Generation (Completion of Reasoning Chain):** The *single* most important capability to focus on improving is ensuring the system generates a *complete* reasoning chain, leading to a specific proposed meeting time. This implicitly also requires outputting that time. The LLM is quitting too early.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nGiven the analysis, I strongly recommend the following iterative changes to the system:\n\n1.  **Reinforce the Prompt (Critical):**\n    *   **System Prompt**: Add a system prompt that states: \"You are a meeting scheduling assistant. You MUST propose a single, specific meeting time in the format 'Here is the proposed time: [Day], [Start Time] - [End Time]' after considering participant availability.\"\n    *   **Solution Instruction**: add \"Conclude by explicitly stating the best single meeting time, formatted exactly as requested. Do not just state who is available when.\"\n    *   **Reiterate**. Repeat the instructions on solution output twice in the prompt.\n2.  **Increase Reasoning Steps (Critical):**\n    *   Break the reasoning process into explicit, numbered steps in the prompt. For example:\n        1.  \"State the problem.\"\n        2.  \"List the constraints from each participant's schedule.\"\n        3.  \"Propose several possible meeting times.\"\n        4.  \"Eliminate times that violate the constraints.\"\n        5.  \"Choose the BEST meeting time that satisfies all (or the most) constraints.\"\n        6.  \"State the proposed time in a complete sentence, formatted EXACTLY like this: 'Here is the proposed time: [Day], [Start Time] - [End Time]'.\"\n        7. \"Reiterate once again what the proposed meeting time is, formatted EXACTLY like this: 'Here is the proposed time: [Day], [Start Time] - [End Time]'.\"\n3.  **Implement Robust Output Verification (Essential):**\n    *   Create a Python function `verify_output(output)` that checks if the LLM's output *strictly* adheres to the required format. The function should use regex or string manipulation to check:\n        *   The presence of the phrase \"Here is the proposed time:\"\n        *   The correct date and time format (e.g., \"Monday, 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM\")\n    *   If `verify_output(output)` returns `False`, re-prompt the LLM with *specific* feedback about the formatting error (e.g., \"Your output is missing the phrase 'Here is the proposed time:'. Please include it.\").\n    *   Include a `max_attempts` parameter to prevent infinite loops.\n4.  **Enhance Few-Shot Examples (Important):**\n    *   Add *several* (3-5) few-shot examples to the prompt, all demonstrating the *exact* required output format. This visually reinforces the desired output structure. Make sure that your few shot examples make explicit statements about time.\n    *   Use varied scheduling scenarios in the examples to demonstrate constraint handling.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are *stable at a very low level*. The system demonstrates some initial understanding but fails to generate usable solutions. The proposed changes aim for a significant *improvement* in solution generation and output formatting in the next iteration.\n",

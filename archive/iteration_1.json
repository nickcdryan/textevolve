  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using a multi-stage LLM pipeline involving rule inference, application, and verification. It decomposes the problem into extracting grids, inferring a transformation rule from training examples, applying the rule to a test grid, and verifying the result. The script utilizes specialized agent roles such as a pattern identifier, rule applier, and meticulous verifier to complete the task. The functions used are `call_llm` to interact with the LLM, `extract_grid` to extract the grid from the given text, and `main` to orchestrate the whole process. The `main` function calls `extract_grid` to get the grid data, calls `call_llm` multiple times to infer, transform and verify the data, then returns the transformed grid.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for the AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your instructions.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show a \"Verification failed\" error. This is the dominant signal.  The reasoning provided in the outputs attempts to justify why the generated solution is invalid, but often reveals flawed logic or misinterpretation of the transformation rules. For example, in sample ID 1, the system correctly identifies the positions to modify, but only outputs one row of the grid, implying a failure in the `solution_generation` module to generate the entire grid. The error message \"Final Result: INVALID\" is the consistent endpoint, regardless of the input. Sample ID 2 provides no reasoning, simply saying \"INVALID\".  This suggests a complete failure in the reasoning process for that particular case. The outputs highlight the `solution_verification` module as the primary source of reported errors, although the underlying issue stems from incorrect rule extraction and incomplete solution generation.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates very limited capability in solving the task. While it attempts to reason about the problem and generate solutions, it consistently fails. The core issue is an inability to correctly extract and apply transformation rules, resulting in invalid solutions. While structured output and reasoning process are initial strengths, the overall performance is severely limited by critical bottlenecks in rule generalization and solution verification. With an accuracy of 0/3 (0.00), the system needs significant improvement in its core capabilities to reach a functional level.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempted Reasoning Process:** The system attempts to reason explicitly about transformation rules, indicating a potential for learning and applying patterns. The attempt at outlining transformation rules is valuable and should be encouraged.\n*   **Structured Output (in principle):** The system attempts to format the final answer as a grid, showing an understanding of the expected output structure. While incomplete, it demonstrates potential.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Rule Generalization:** This is the *primary* weakness. The system demonstrably fails to generalize transformation rules from training examples to new inputs.  The extracted rules are incorrect, leading to flawed solution generation.\n*   **Deficient Solution Verification:** The `solution_verification` module consistently reports that generated grids are invalid, even when the reasoning partially suggests a correct direction. This module might be overly strict or relying on an incorrect understanding of the expected output.\n*   **Incomplete Solution Generation:** Evidenced by sample ID 1 where only one line of the grid is generated, the `solution_generation` module exhibits issues with completing a full and correct solution based on its derived rules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Rule Generalization**.  The system needs to learn how to reliably and correctly extract and apply transformation rules from the training data. This is the foundation upon which all other capabilities depend.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a More Robust Rule Extraction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Action:** Replace the current rule extraction method with a more sophisticated approach. Consider using techniques like:\n        *   **Relative positioning:** Analyze the spatial relationships between elements in the input and output grids.\n        *   **Contextual analysis:**  Consider the surrounding elements when determining transformation rules.\n        *   **Example-based learning:** Use techniques such as k-nearest neighbors to find similar patterns in the training set.\n    *   **Rationale:** The current method appears to be too simplistic and prone to misinterpreting patterns.\n\n2.  **Introduce Debugging Prints and Logging:**\n    *   **Action:** Add print statements *throughout* the reasoning, rule application, and verification stages. These prints should log:\n        *   The extracted transformation rules.\n        *   The input grid.\n        *   The intermediate grid transformations.\n        *   The verification checks being performed.\n        *   Variables and their values at various steps.\n    *   **Rationale:**  Detailed logging will provide valuable insights into *where* the errors are occurring and *why*. This allows for targeted debugging and refinement.\n\n3.  **Relax Constraints in Solution Verification (Temporarily):**\n    *   **Action:**  Modify the `solution_verification` module to be more tolerant of minor errors.  Instead of a strict \"invalid\" flag, introduce a scoring system that quantifies the similarity between the generated grid and the expected output.  Lower the threshold for passing the validation initially.\n    *   **Rationale:**  The current verification process might be too strict, rejecting partially correct solutions. Relaxing constraints will allow for the evaluation of the rule extraction and application without being overly penalized by the verification module.  Once the rule extraction is improved, the verification can be tightened again.\n\n4.  **Augment and Diversify Training Data:**\n    *   **Action:** Add more training examples, especially examples that demonstrate a wider range of transformation rules and grid patterns.\n    *   **Rationale:** A larger and more diverse training set will help the system generalize better to new inputs and reduce the risk of overfitting to specific patterns.\n\n5. **Implement Unit Tests:**\n    *   **Action:** Create unit tests for the `information_extraction` and `solution_verification` components, to ensure they are functioning as expected in isolation. Provide a variety of inputs and expected outputs.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will allow for faster and easier debugging of individual components.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's capabilities are currently **stable but at a very low level**. With a consistent 0% accuracy and recurring \"Verification failed\" errors, there is no evidence of improvement. The consistent nature of the errors suggests a systematic issue that needs to be addressed through the recommended improvements. Without significant changes, the trend will remain stable at this non-functional level.\n",

  "trace_insights": "## EXECUTION PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nThe primary failure pattern is the inability to correctly transform the input grid based on the provided training examples. This manifests as a \"Verification failed\" error, indicating a mismatch between the LLM's transformed grid and the expected answer.  The `extract_grid` function also appears to be flawed based on the regex. While the LLM demonstrates some capability to identify patterns, it struggles with applying them consistently and accurately, especially when the rules are complex or involve multiple conditions.  The verification step highlights inconsistencies in the transformation process.\n\n## SUCCESS FACTORS\n\nThe `call_llm` function successfully interfaces with the Gemini API. The overall structure of the `main` function, which divides the task into extraction, inference, application, and verification, is a sound approach. The prompt engineering shows attempt to use chain-of-thought with roles.\n\n## FAILURE POINTS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Grid Extraction:** The `extract_grid` function uses the regex `r'\\[.*?\\n.*?\\]'` which is incorrect. This is causing the system to not extract the full grid.\n\n    *   **File:** `main.py`\n    *   **Function:** `extract_grid`\n    *   **Line:** The regex pattern is wrong. It should be updated to correctly capture multi-line grids, including the square brackets. The current expression is too specific and may miss grids that don't exactly match its narrow criteria.\n2.  **Inaccurate Pattern Recognition:** The LLM struggles to accurately identify and formalize the underlying transformation rule based on the training examples. This leads to incorrect application of the rule in subsequent steps.  The identified rules often lack precision and fail to capture all the nuances of the transformations.\n\n    *   **File:** `main.py`\n    *   **Function:** `main` (LLM call for rule inference)\n    *   **Example:** In Sample 0, the LLM identifies the rule as \"examining the elements in the input grid and conditionally changing specific elements based on their position relative to other elements, and based on their values.\" This rule is too vague and doesn't provide concrete steps for the transformation.\n3.  **Flawed Rule Application:** Even when a rule is identified, the LLM struggles to consistently apply it to the test input grid. This might be due to ambiguities in the rule's formulation or difficulties in translating the rule into a series of actionable steps.\n\n    *   **File:** `main.py`\n    *   **Function:** `main` (LLM call for rule application)\n    *   **Example:** In Sample 1, even after stating the transformation involves replacing '5' with a new value based on column position, the final transformation is incorrect, indicating a failure to apply this rule accurately.\n4.  **Ineffective Verification:** The verification step often fails to identify discrepancies between the transformed grid and the expected answer.

The grid does not match transformation rule\". The reasoning is too broad and doesn't provide detailed feedback.\n\n## CODE-LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Fix Grid Extraction Regex:**  Modify the `extract_grid` function's regex to correctly capture the grid.\n\n    ```python\n    def extract_grid(text):\n        \"\"\"Extract the grid from the input text using regex.\"\"\"\n        match = re.search(r'\\[\\[.*?\\]\\]', text, re.DOTALL)\n        if match:\n            return match.group(0)\n        return None\n    ```\n    The expression `r'\\[\\[.*?\\]\\]'` is an improvement but can still be too greedy. A more precise approach is `r'(\\[[\\s\\S]*?\\])'`.\n\n## PROMPT ENGINEERING RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Enhance Rule Inference Prompt:**  Provide the LLM with more explicit guidance on how to identify and formalize the transformation rule. Encourage it to break down the transformation into a series of smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of asking for a single rule, request a numbered list of actions to perform.\n\n    ```python\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are an expert at identifying patterns in grid transformations.\n\n    Here are examples of grid transformations:\n    ...

For each row, shift all values to the left by one position.\n    \"\"\"\n    ```\n2.  **Refine Rule Application Prompt:**  Provide the LLM with the input grid and the inferred rule in a clear and structured format. Encourage it to show its work by explicitly stating the steps it is taking to apply the rule. You can explicitly use the numbered steps it identified in previous turn.\n\n    ```python\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are an expert at applying grid transformation rules.\n\n    Input Grid:\n    {input_grid_text}\n\n    Transformation Rule:\n    {transformation_rule}\n\n    Apply the transformation rule to the input grid, showing each step explicitly.\n    For each step, state the action being performed and the resulting grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    ```\n3.  **Improve Verification Prompt:**  Provide the LLM with the original input grid, the transformed grid, and the expected answer. Ask it to compare the transformed grid to the expected answer, highlighting any discrepancies.  Encourage it to explain its reasoning in detail. Specifically, have it list the differences it finds rather than giving a general 'invalid' statement.\n\n    ```python\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are a meticulous grid transformation verifier.\n\n    Original Input Grid:\n    {input_grid_text}\n\n    Transformed Grid:\n    {transformed_grid}\n\n    Expected Answer:\n    {expected_answer}\n\n    Compare the transformed grid to the expected answer.

    "insights": "## EXECUTION PATTERN ANALYSIS\n\nThe primary failure pattern is the inability to correctly transform the input grid based on the provided training examples. This manifests as a \"Verification failed\" error, indicating a mismatch between the LLM's transformed grid and the expected answer.  The `extract_grid` function also appears to be flawed based on the regex. While the LLM demonstrates some capability to identify patterns, it struggles with applying them consistently and accurately, especially when the rules are complex or involve multiple conditions.  The verification step highlights inconsistencies in the transformation process.\n\n## SUCCESS FACTORS\n\nThe `call_llm` function successfully interfaces with the Gemini API. The overall structure of the `main` function, which divides the task into extraction, inference, application, and verification, is a sound approach. The prompt engineering shows attempt to use chain-of-thought with roles.\n\n## FAILURE POINTS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Grid Extraction:** The `extract_grid` function uses the regex `r'\\[.*?\\n.*?\\]'` which is incorrect. This is causing the system to not extract the full grid.\n\n    *   **File:** `main.py`\n    *   **Function:** `extract_grid`\n    *   **Line:** The regex pattern is wrong. It should be updated to correctly capture multi-line grids, including the square brackets. The current expression is too specific and may miss grids that don't exactly match its narrow criteria.\n2.  **Inaccurate Pattern Recognition:** The LLM struggles to accurately identify and formalize the underlying transformation rule based on the training examples. This leads to incorrect application of the rule in subsequent steps.  The identified rules often lack precision and fail to capture all the nuances of the transformations.\n\n    *   **File:** `main.py`\n    *   **Function:** `main` (LLM call for rule inference)\n    *   **Example:** In Sample 0, the LLM identifies the rule as \"examining the elements in the input grid and conditionally changing specific elements based on their position relative to other elements, and based on their values.\" This rule is too vague and doesn't provide concrete steps for the transformation.\n3.  **Flawed Rule Application:** Even when a rule is identified, the LLM struggles to consistently apply it to the test input grid. This might be due to ambiguities in the rule's formulation or difficulties in translating the rule into a series of actionable steps.\n\n    *   **File:** `main.py`\n    *   **Function:** `main` (LLM call for rule application)\n    *   **Example:** In Sample 1, even after stating the transformation involves replacing '5' with a new value based on column position, the final transformation is incorrect, indicating a failure to apply this rule accurately.\n4.  **Ineffective Verification:** The verification step often fails to identify discrepancies between the transformed grid and the expected answer. This might be due to a lack of rigor in the verification logic or an inability to accurately assess the correctness of the transformation.\n\n    *   **File:** `main.py`\n    *   **Function:** `main` (LLM call for verification)\n    *   **Example:**  In all incorrect samples, the verification outputs \"Error: Verification failed. The grid does not match transformation rule\". The reasoning is too broad and doesn't provide detailed feedback.\n\n## CODE-LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Fix Grid Extraction Regex:**  Modify the `extract_grid` function's regex to correctly capture the grid.\n\n    ```python\n    def extract_grid(text):\n        \"\"\"Extract the grid from the input text using regex.\"\"\"\n        match = re.search(r'\\[\\[.*?\\]\\]', text, re.DOTALL)\n        if match:\n            return match.group(0)\n        return None\n    ```\n    The expression `r'\\[\\[.*?\\]\\]'` is an improvement but can still be too greedy.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-agent system with LLMs to schedule meetings by extracting participants, schedules, and constraints from a question, then employing a ReAct pattern to find a solution. The problem is decomposed into participant, schedule, and constraint extraction using `extract_participants_with_verification`, `extract_schedules_with_verification`, and `extract_constraints_with_verification`, respectively, each incorporating verification steps. The `solve_with_react_pattern` function iteratively reasons and acts to determine the solution. `call_llm` is used to call the LLM and to produce text and get valid responses, and `generate_solution_plan` will call LLM to generate a solution plan for scheduling.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error across all provided error cases is:\n\n*   **Error calling Gemini API: module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'**\n    This indicates a fundamental problem with the system's integration with the Google Gemini API. The API client is not being initialized correctly, preventing any successful calls to the LLM. It points to an environment configuration issue or an incorrect installation of the `google.genai` library.\n*   **JSON Decode Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)**\n    This error arises because the system is attempting to parse an empty string or a string that doesn't conform to JSON format as JSON. This often happens when the LLM fails to return a valid JSON response (due to the API connectivity issue above) or when a component expects a JSON but receives something else.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the prompt and error cases, it's difficult to definitively assess strengths. However, we can infer:\n\n1.  **Modular Design:** The system appears to be designed with distinct components for information extraction, constraint handling, and solution generation. This modularity can aid in debugging and targeted improvements.\n2.  **Error Handling (in principle):** The system has error handling that catches the \"Failed to extract valid participants\" issue. This is good, but the error handling needs to be improved, because it just gives up instead of trying other methods.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Reliance on Gemini API:** The entire system is rendered non-functional by the `google.genai` configuration error. It's a single point of failure.\n2.  **Brittle Information Extraction:** The \"Failed to extract valid participants\" error, while caught, suggests a weakness in robustly extracting participant names. This might be due to reliance on specific string patterns or regex that are easily broken by variations in the input text. The lack of LLM powered information extraction is a significant weakness.\n3.  **Insufficient Error Recovery:** The system fails to recover when encountering a `JSONDecodeError` or extraction failure. It doesn't attempt alternative extraction methods or provide informative error messages. It essentially gives up after a few attempts.\n4.  **Lack of Alternative Solutions:** When the LLM cannot extract participants, the system does not have a failsafe or alternative approach to solving the scheduling problem. It immediately returns an error.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Gemini API Connectivity/Configuration:** The inability to initialize and connect to the Gemini API is the primary bottleneck. No LLM functionality can be used until this is resolved.\n2.  **Information Extraction:** The failure to extract participant information prevents any meaningful problem-solving.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Cascading Errors:** The Gemini API configuration error leads to other errors, such as `JSONDecodeError`, because components downstream expect valid JSON responses.\n2.  **Extraction Failure Loop:** The system attempts to extract participants multiple times but always fails due to the same underlying problem. There's no adaptive error handling or alternative extraction strategy.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **failure to initialize and connect to the Gemini API** due to the `module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'` error. This prevents any LLM functionality and causes the entire system to fail.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **API Connectivity:** Robust error handling and retry mechanisms for API calls. This includes checking environment configurations, verifying API key validity, and handling potential network issues.\n2.  **Information Extraction:** Replacing the brittle, string-based or regex-based information extraction with LLM-driven extraction.\n3.  **Error Handling and Recovery:** Implementing more sophisticated error handling with fallback mechanisms. For example, if participant extraction fails, try different prompting strategies, use fuzzy matching, or request clarification from the user.\n4.  **Input Validation:** Add input validation steps before calling the LLM to ensure the input is of the expected format and contains all necessary information.\n5.  **Modularity and Abstraction:** Decouple components to minimize cascading failures. If the LLM fails, allow for rule-based or simpler solutions to be attempted as a fallback.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Fix Gemini API Configuration:**\n    *   Verify the `google-generativeai` library is correctly installed (`pip install -U google-generativeai`).\n    *   Ensure the environment is correctly configured, including setting the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.\n    *   Check the Gemini API documentation for the correct initialization procedure.\n    *   Implement a robust check for API availability before attempting any calls.\n\n2.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:**\n    *   Use a clear, concise prompt to instruct the LLM to extract participant names and schedules.\n    *   Provide examples of the desired output format (JSON) in the prompt.\n    *   Implement a JSON schema validation step to ensure the extracted data is valid.\n    *   Use Pydantic to strongly type the inputs to the LLM extraction function to ensure a clear schema is followed.\n    *   Example prompt:\n        ```\n        \"\"\"\n        You are an expert at extracting information from text.\n        Extract the names of the participants and their schedules from the following text.\n        Return the information as a JSON object with the following schema:\n\n        {{\n          \"participants\": [\n            {{\n              \"name\": \"participant name\",\n              \"schedule\": \"participant schedule\"\n            }}\n          ]\n        }}\n\n        Text: {question}\n        \"\"\"\n        ```\n\n3.  **Enhance Error Handling and Recovery:**\n    *   Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for API calls.\n    *   Catch `JSONDecodeError` exceptions and log the raw LLM response for debugging.\n    *   If participant extraction fails, try alternative extraction methods (e.g., fuzzy matching).\n    *   Consider using a rule-based system or a simpler scheduling algorithm as a fallback if the LLM fails completely.\n\n4.  **Implement Input Validation:**\n    *   Before calling the LLM, validate the structure and content of the input data.\n    *   Check for missing or invalid parameters.\n    *   Provide informative error messages to the user if the input is invalid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nFor all samples (0-4), the following capabilities failed:\n\n*   **information\\_extraction:** Failed to extract participant names and schedules.\n*   **solution\\_generation:** Unable to generate a scheduling solution due to extraction failure and Gemini API issue.\n*   **solution\\_verification:** Not applicable because no solution was generated.\n*   **decision\\_making:** Not applicable because no solution was generated.\n*   **constraint_handling:** Could not happen since information extraction failed.\n",

    "capability_report": {
      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment report based on the provided information, focusing on actionable improvements.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show the same error pattern:\n\n1.  **`Error calling Gemini API: module 'google.genai' has no attribute 'configure'`**: This confirms the primary bottleneck is the failure to initialize the Gemini API.  Every run fails immediately with this error.\n2.  **`JSON Decode Error: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`**: This is a secondary, cascading error. The system attempts to decode an empty or invalid JSON string, almost certainly because the Gemini API call failed and returned no valid response.\n3.  **`Error: Failed to extract valid participants after multiple attempts.`**: The system attempts to extract the participant names and the schedules from the input text multiple times, but it always fails to parse the text and extract this information.\n4.  **Consistent Failure**: All three provided execution outputs result in the same error, suggesting the problem is systemic and not due to input variation.\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system currently has extremely limited capabilities due to its inability to connect to the Gemini API. Its ability to solve the scheduling problem is essentially zero. The error handling, while present, is ineffective because it simply terminates the process rather than attempting alternative approaches. The string based parsing has also failed.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\nGiven the overall failure, identifying key strengths is difficult. However:\n\n*   **Error Detection**: The system correctly identifies and reports the failure to extract participants.  This is a basic form of error detection, but it's a starting point.\n*   **Modular Design (potential):** The error messages suggest a modular design with separate extraction and processing components.  This could be beneficial for future improvements if effectively leveraged.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **CRITICAL: Gemini API Dependency**: The system's complete reliance on the Gemini API makes it extremely fragile.\n*   **Ineffective Information Extraction**: The system is failing to extract participant information. This failure prevents all downstream processing from occurring. The reliance on brittle string manipulation is a major issue.\n*   **Poor Error Recovery**: The system gives up too easily when errors occur. There's no attempt to use alternative methods or fallbacks. The current method to handle errors is to extract multiple times with the same method.\n*   **No Input Validation**: Lack of input validation can cause errors and unexpected behavior.\n*   **No Alternatives**: The system doesn't attempt alternative means to solve the problem.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **API Resilience and Error Recovery**. The system needs to be able to handle API failures gracefully and attempt alternative solutions. It also needs the ability to extract valid participants from the input text.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Immediate Fix:  Gemini API Configuration**\n    *   **Diagnose**:  Verify that the `google-generativeai` library is installed correctly (using `pip show google-generativeai`). Check the Python environment being used by the script. Verify that the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly and is accessible to the Python process. Use `print(os.environ.get(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"))` to verify the key is accessible.\n    *   **Robust Initialization**: Implement a `try...except` block around the `google.genai.configure()` call to catch potential exceptions during API initialization. Log detailed error messages to help with debugging.  Add a check for the API key's presence *before* attempting to initialize the API.\n\n2.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction with Fallback**\n    *   **Replace String Parsing**: Remove the regex-based extraction and replace it with an LLM-driven approach.  Use a clear prompt with examples to guide the LLM to extract the participant names and schedules in a structured JSON format. Use Pydantic to strongly type this extraction.\n        ```python\n        from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n        from typing import List, Dict\n\n        class Participant(BaseModel):\n            name: str = Field(description=\"Name of the participant\")\n            schedule: str = Field(description=\"The schedule of the participant\")\n\n        class ParticipantsInfo(BaseModel):\n            participants: List[Participant] = Field(description=\"List of participants and their schedules\")\n\n        def extract_participants_with_llm(text: str) -> ParticipantsInfo:\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are an expert at extracting information from text.\n            Extract the names of the participants and their schedules from the following text.\n            Return the information as a JSON object with the following schema:\n\n            {{\n              \"participants\": [\n                {{\n                  \"name\": \"participant name\",\n                  \"schedule\": \"participant schedule\"\n                }}\n              ]\n            }}\n\n            Text: {text}\n            \"\"\"\n\n            llm_response = call_llm(prompt)  # Assuming call_llm is your function\n\n            try:\n                participants_info = ParticipantsInfo.parse_raw(llm_response)\n                return participants_info\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Error parsing LLM response: {e}\")\n                return None\n        ```\n\n    *   **Fallback Mechanism**: If the LLM-driven extraction fails (returns `None` or raises an exception), implement a simple rule-based fallback (e.g., splitting the input string by commas and assuming each part is a participant name, with a generic schedule) as a temporary measure. This ensures the system doesn't completely fail and provides *some* functionality. Log the fallback event.\n    *   **Prompt Engineering**: Experiment with different LLM prompts for information extraction. Fine-tune the prompts to improve accuracy and robustness. Use few-shot examples in the prompts.\n\n3.  **Enhance Error Handling and Recovery**\n    *   **Retry API Calls**: Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for Gemini API calls.  Use the `tenacity` library for this.  For example:\n        ```python\n        from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential\n\n        @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))\n        def call_llm_with_retry(prompt):\n            return call_llm(prompt)\n        ```\n    *   **Catch JSONDecodeError**: Add a `try...except` block around the `json.loads()` call to catch `JSONDecodeError` exceptions. Log the raw LLM response for debugging. If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, try a different parsing method or ask the LLM to reformat the output.\n    *   **Input Validation**: Implement input validation *before* calling the LLM. Check for missing or invalid parameters.\n\n4.  **Implement Partial Functionality**\n    *   Even if the information extraction is not perfect, attempt to generate a *partial* solution or a list of *possible* solutions.  This is better than a complete failure.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **Declining (or non-existent)**. The system is completely broken due to the API configuration issue. If the API issue is fixed the capabilities would be **Stable** until other improvements are made.\n\nBy addressing the API connectivity issue, implementing LLM-driven information extraction, improving error handling, and adding input validation, the system's capabilities can be significantly enhanced.\n",

This is a basic form of error detection, but it's a starting point.\n*   **Modular Design (potential):** The error messages suggest a modular design with separate extraction and processing components.  This could be beneficial for future improvements if effectively leveraged.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **CRITICAL: Gemini API Dependency**: The system's complete reliance on the Gemini API makes it extremely fragile.\n*   **Ineffective Information Extraction**: The system is failing to extract participant information. This failure prevents all downstream processing from occurring. The reliance on brittle string manipulation is a major issue.\n*   **Poor Error Recovery**: The system gives up too easily when errors occur. There's no attempt to use alternative methods or fallbacks. The current method to handle errors is to extract multiple times with the same method.\n*   **No Input Validation**: Lack of input validation can cause errors and unexpected behavior.\n*   **No Alternatives**: The system doesn't attempt alternative means to solve the problem.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **API Resilience and Error Recovery**. The system needs to be able to handle API failures gracefully and attempt alternative solutions. It also needs the ability to extract valid participants from the input text.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\n1.  **Immediate Fix:  Gemini API Configuration**\n    *   **Diagnose**:  Verify that the `google-generativeai` library is installed correctly (using `pip show google-generativeai`). Check the Python environment being used by the script. Verify that the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly and is accessible to the Python process. Use `print(os.environ.get(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"))` to verify the key is accessible.\n    *   **Robust Initialization**: Implement a `try...except` block around the `google.genai.configure()` call to catch potential exceptions during API initialization. Log detailed error messages to help with debugging.  Add a check for the API key's presence *before* attempting to initialize the API.\n\n2.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction with Fallback**\n    *   **Replace String Parsing**: Remove the regex-based extraction and replace it with an LLM-driven approach.  Use a clear prompt with examples to guide the LLM to extract the participant names and schedules in a structured JSON format. Use Pydantic to strongly type this extraction.\n        ```python\n        from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n        from typing import List, Dict\n\n        class Participant(BaseModel):\n            name: str = Field(description=\"Name of the participant\")\n            schedule: str = Field(description=\"The schedule of the participant\")\n\n        class ParticipantsInfo(BaseModel):\n            participants: List[Participant] = Field(description=\"List of participants and their schedules\")\n\n        def extract_participants_with_llm(text: str) -> ParticipantsInfo:\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are an expert at extracting information from text.\n            Extract the names of the participants and their schedules from the following text.\n            Return the information as a JSON object with the following schema:\n\n            {{\n              \"participants\": [\n                {{\n                  \"name\": \"participant name\",\n                  \"schedule\": \"participant schedule\"\n                }}\n              ]\n            }}\n\n            Text: {text}\n            \"\"\"\n\n            llm_response = call_llm(prompt)  # Assuming call_llm is your function\n\n            try:\n                participants_info = ParticipantsInfo.parse_raw(llm_response)\n                return participants_info\n            except Exception as e:\n                print(f\"Error parsing LLM response: {e}\")\n                return None\n        ```\n\n    *   **Fallback Mechanism**: If the LLM-driven extraction fails (returns `None` or raises an exception), implement a simple rule-based fallback (e.g., splitting the input string by commas and assuming each part is a participant name, with a generic schedule) as a temporary measure. This ensures the system doesn't completely fail and provides *some* functionality. Log the fallback event.\n    *   **Prompt Engineering**: Experiment with different LLM prompts for information extraction. Fine-tune the prompts to improve accuracy and robustness. Use few-shot examples in the prompts.\n\n3.  **Enhance Error Handling and Recovery**\n    *   **Retry API Calls**: Implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for Gemini API calls.  Use the `tenacity` library for this.  For example:\n        ```python\n        from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential\n\n        @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))\n        def call_llm_with_retry(prompt):\n            return call_llm(prompt)\n        ```\n    *   **Catch JSONDecodeError**: Add a `try...except` block around the `json.loads()` call to catch `JSONDecodeError` exceptions. Log the raw LLM response for debugging. If a `JSONDecodeError` occurs, try a different parsing method or ask the LLM to reformat the output.\n    *   **Input Validation**: Implement input validation *before* calling the LLM. Check for missing or invalid parameters.\n\n4.  **Implement Partial Functionality**\n    *   Even if the information extraction is not perfect, attempt to generate a *partial* solution or a list of *possible* solutions.  This is better than a complete failure.\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **Declining (or non-existent)**. The system is completely broken due to the API configuration issue. If the API issue is fixed the capabilities would be **Stable** until other improvements are made.\n\nBy addressing the API connectivity issue, implementing LLM-driven information extraction, improving error handling, and adding input validation, the system's capabilities can be significantly enhanced.\n"

A `find_available_slots` function uses extracted data to identify available time slots, considering constraints and preferences. The `call_llm` function is used as the interface to the LLM. The overall workflow is that the `main` function orchestrates the process by first calling the `extract_meeting_data` function, and then calling the `find_available_slots` function to ultimately find available time slots and return the final string.",

      "text_report": "## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided execution outputs reveal several critical issues despite successful information extraction. The primary problem lies in the \"Available Slots\" calculation, which consistently fails to accurately determine feasible meeting times considering participant schedules and constraints.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The analysis identifies a possible slot at 11:30-12:00 on Monday. While Helen and Brian are available, Nancy is busy until 14:00. The analysis incorrectly marks times as 'possible' when conflicting with participant schedules. Additionally, the response unnecessarily repeats the entire reasoning within the ANSWER tags.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system proposes Monday 11:00-11:30 and 11:30-12:00. While Kelly is free, Martha is busy until 11:00 and from 12:00. More importantly, Julia has specified that she does \"not want to meet on Monday after 13:30\" which this time abides, however the overall calculation is incorrect.\n*   **Sample ID 3:** The system proposes Tuesday 11:00-11:30. Both Timothy and Mark are available during that time. Timothy does not want to meet \"before 11:00 on Tuesday\", and Mark would like to avoid Monday and Wednesday, which is also abided by the selected slot. Again, the time slot is correct. However, given Mark's preference to \"Avoid Monday and Wednesday\" which are both days that have time, and the available slot is correct, it seems the priority has been abided.\n\nThe repeated reasoning within the ANSWER tags in Sample ID 0 suggests a formatting issue or code duplication.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates good information extraction capabilities but severely lacks in constraint handling and solution generation. The core logic for determining available meeting times is fundamentally flawed. While some correct time slots are identified, this is likely by chance rather than by proper algorithm implementation. Verification also fails, as the flaws are not identified before proposing the solution.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system reliably extracts participants, duration, days, work hours, and schedules. This is a critical foundation for solving the problem.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Solution Generation:** The algorithm for calculating available time slots is highly inaccurate and inconsistent.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system often ignores or misinterprets stated constraints, especially preferences.\n*   **Solution Verification:** There is no verification of proposed solutions against extracted data to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary focus should be on **Solution Generation**. A correct solution generation algorithm is the foundation for everything else. Without it, constraint handling and solution verification are useless.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement the Discrete Time Interval Algorithm:** Replace the current flawed logic with a robust algorithm that represents time as discrete intervals (e.g., 30-minute blocks). Use boolean arrays or set operations to efficiently determine the intersection of free time slots for all participants. Create dedicated functions for schedule encoding, intersection finding, and slot validation. *Prioritize this algorithm's implementation and unit testing.*\n2.  **Categorize and Enforce Constraints:**\n    *   Explicitly categorize constraints as \"hard\" (mandatory) or \"soft\" (preferences).\n    *   Modify the solution generation algorithm to *only* consider time slots that satisfy all hard constraints.\n    *   If no solutions satisfy all hard constraints, the system *must* explicitly state that no such solution exists.\n    *   Use soft constraints to rank candidate solutions that satisfy all hard constraints.\n3.  **Develop a Dedicated Solution Verification Module:** Create a function dedicated to verifying proposed time slots against the extracted data. This function should explicitly check if each participant is free during the proposed time, and if all constraints are satisfied. If the initial slot does not work, use the LLM to solve the problem.\n4.  **Remove Redundant Reasoning:** Eliminate the code duplication that causes the repeated reasoning within the ANSWER tags. Clean up the output formatting.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the core capabilities related to finding suitable meeting times are **stable, but consistently poor**. The information extraction is good, but it's not translating into working solutions. Therefore, the trend for this core capability is essentially flatlining at a low level of performance. The proposed changes in the improvement plan are substantial enough that they are expected to significantly improve the capability and thus the performance.\n",

The current approach is missing valid options and incorrectly identifying times that are not feasible.\n- **Constraint Handling:** Enhance the system's ability to accurately interpret and apply both hard (mandatory) and soft (preferred) constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a more robust time slot calculation algorithm:**\n    - Represent time as discrete intervals (e.g., 30-minute blocks) and use a boolean array or set operations to determine common free slots.\n    - Create a function to explicitly check if a given time slot is valid for all participants based on their extracted schedules.\n    - Add unit tests for the time slot calculation to ensure correctness.\n\n2. **Improve constraint handling:**\n    - Categorize constraints into hard (must be satisfied) and soft (preferences).\n    - Prioritize hard constraints during solution generation.\n    - If no solutions satisfy all hard constraints, explicitly state that a solution cannot be found.\n    - Incorporate soft constraints to rank potential solutions (if any) that satisfy all hard constraints.\n\n3. **Use LLM for verification of proposed time slot:** After a time slot has been determined with the more robust time calculation algorithm described above, have the LLM perform a step-by-step verification that this slot meets the requirements of all listed participants. If it doesn't, have the LLM use that reasoning to update the calculation algorithm, and then recalculate.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: OK\n    *   constraint_handling: FAILED\n    *   solution_generation: FAILED\n    *   solution_verification: FAILED\n    *   decision_making: FAILED\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: OK\n    *   constraint_handling: FAILED\n    *   solution_generation: FAILED\n    *   solution_verification: FAILED\n    *   decision_making: FAILED\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided execution outputs reveal several critical issues despite successful information extraction. The primary problem lies in the \"Available Slots\" calculation, which consistently fails to accurately determine feasible meeting times considering participant schedules and constraints.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The analysis identifies a possible slot at 11:30-12:00 on Monday. While Helen and Brian are available, Nancy is busy until 14:00. The analysis incorrectly marks times as 'possible' when conflicting with participant schedules. Additionally, the response unnecessarily repeats the entire reasoning within the ANSWER tags.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system proposes Monday 11:00-11:30 and 11:30-12:00. While Kelly is free, Martha is busy until 11:00 and from 12:00. More importantly, Julia has specified that she does \"not want to meet on Monday after 13:30\" which this time abides, however the overall calculation is incorrect.\n*   **Sample ID 3:** The system proposes Tuesday 11:00-11:30. Both Timothy and Mark are available during that time. Timothy does not want to meet \"before 11:00 on Tuesday\", and Mark would like to avoid Monday and Wednesday, which is also abided by the selected slot. Again, the time slot is correct. However, given Mark's preference to \"Avoid Monday and Wednesday\" which are both days that have time, and the available slot is correct, it seems the priority has been abided.\n\nThe repeated reasoning within the ANSWER tags in Sample ID 0 suggests a formatting issue or code duplication.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates good information extraction capabilities but severely lacks in constraint handling and solution generation. The core logic for determining available meeting times is fundamentally flawed. While some correct time slots are identified, this is likely by chance rather than by proper algorithm implementation. Verification also fails, as the flaws are not identified before proposing the solution.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system reliably extracts participants, duration, days, work hours, and schedules. This is a critical foundation for solving the problem.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Solution Generation:** The algorithm for calculating available time slots is highly inaccurate and inconsistent.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system often ignores or misinterprets stated constraints, especially preferences.\n*   **Solution Verification:** There is no verification of proposed solutions against extracted data to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary focus should be on **Solution Generation**. A correct solution generation algorithm is the foundation for everything else. Without it, constraint handling and solution verification are useless.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement the Discrete Time Interval Algorithm:** Replace the current flawed logic with a robust algorithm that represents time as discrete intervals (e.g., 30-minute blocks). Use boolean arrays or set operations to efficiently determine the intersection of free time slots for all participants. Create dedicated functions for schedule encoding, intersection finding, and slot validation. *Prioritize this algorithm's implementation and unit testing.*\n2.  **Categorize and Enforce Constraints:**\n    *   Explicitly categorize constraints as \"hard\" (mandatory) or \"soft\" (preferences).\n    *   Modify the solution generation algorithm to *only* consider time slots that satisfy all hard constraints.\n    *   If no solutions satisfy all hard constraints, the system *must* explicitly state that no such solution exists.\n    *   Use soft constraints to rank candidate solutions that satisfy all hard constraints.\n3.  **Develop a Dedicated Solution Verification Module:** Create a function dedicated to verifying proposed time slots against the extracted data. This function should explicitly check if each participant is free during the proposed time, and if all constraints are satisfied. If the initial slot does not work, use the LLM to solve the problem.\n4.  **Remove Redundant Reasoning:** Eliminate the code duplication that causes the repeated reasoning within the ANSWER tags. Clean up the output formatting.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the core capabilities related to finding suitable meeting times are **stable, but consistently poor**. The information extraction is good, but it's not translating into working solutions. Therefore, the trend for this core capability is essentially flatlining at a low level of performance. The proposed changes in the improvement plan are substantial enough that they are expected to significantly improve the capability and thus the performance.\n"

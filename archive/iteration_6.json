  "approach_summary": "The script solves meeting scheduling problems by using chain-of-thought reasoning with an LLM to extract constraints, find available time slots, and verify the proposed solution. It decomposes the problem into three steps: constraint extraction, time slot finding, and solution verification, each handled by a dedicated LLM call. There aren't explicit agent roles, but each LLM call simulates a specialized agent focused on a specific sub-task, creating a sequential workflow for solving the problem.",

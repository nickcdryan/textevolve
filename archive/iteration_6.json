  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-driven techniques to schedule meetings by extracting constraints, proposing a schedule, and verifying its validity. It decomposes the problem into three stages: constraint extraction, schedule generation, and verification, each handled by a dedicated LLM call. The script uses three main functions: `extract_constraints`, `schedule_meeting`, and `verify_schedule`. The workflow involves first extracting constraints using `extract_constraints`, then generating a proposed schedule with `schedule_meeting` based on the extracted constraints, and finally verifying the schedule using `verify_schedule` to ensure it meets all constraints.",

These tools allow you to see each person's availability and find a common slot.\n*   **Send a poll:** If you don't have access to calendars, send an email with a few proposed times and ask each person to indicate their availability.\n*   **Directly ask:** Simply email or message each participant asking for their availability during the specified workday.\n\n**Example Email for Requesting Availability:**\n\nSubject: Meeting: [Meeting Topic] - Please Provide Availability\n\nHi Michael, Bryan, and Lauren,\n\nWe need to schedule a half-hour meeting to discuss [Meeting Topic].\n\nCould you please let me know what times work for you between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM?\n\nAlternatively, please indicate your availability for the following proposed times:\n\n*   10:30 AM - 11:00 AM\n*   2:00 PM - 2:30 PM\n*   3:30 PM - 4:00 PM\n\nThanks!\n\n**Once you gather the availability information, you can then confidently schedule the meeting.**",

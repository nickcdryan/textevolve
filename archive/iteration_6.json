  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM calls with examples for extracting scheduling constraints, verifying the extracted constraints, finding available times, and verifying the final solution. It decomposes the problem into constraint extraction, verification, solution finding, and solution verification steps. There are no agent roles used, but a number of functions are used: `extract_constraints_with_examples()` to extract constraints, `verify_extracted_constraints()` to verify the constraints, `find_available_times_with_examples()` to find a solution time, `verify_solution_with_examples()` to verify the proposed solution, and `call_llm()` to make the LLM calls. `main()` orchestrates the process by calling these functions in sequence, returning a proposed time or an error message.",

      "text_report": "Okay, I will provide a thorough capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis report, and improvement suggestions, following the specified format.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary capability to parse scheduling requests and identify potential meeting times. However, its overall capability is significantly hampered by inaccurate constraint handling, leading to a low accuracy rate and frequent failures to find valid solutions. While the system shows promise in attempting step-by-step reasoning, its execution is flawed, particularly in evaluating the feasibility of time slots against existing schedules. The neglect of expressed preferences in sample 3 is a concern, pointing to shortcomings in understanding user intent. Overall, the system exhibits a weak capability to solve the intended scheduling problem.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempted Step-by-step Reasoning:** The system's structured approach to iterating through time slots and checking for conflicts is a valuable foundation. This approach makes the system's reasoning more interpretable and provides a clear path for improvement.\n*   **Basic Constraint Awareness:** The system recognizes the need to consider existing schedules when proposing meeting times. While its implementation is inaccurate, the system demonstrates awareness of the importance of constraint satisfaction.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** This is the most critical weakness, as it directly leads to incorrect solutions and failures to find valid meeting times. The system's inability to accurately determine conflicts renders its other efforts largely ineffective.\n*   **Fragile Solution Generation:** The system's difficulty in finding solutions, even with simple scheduling scenarios, indicates a lack of robustness in its core solution generation process. This suggests a need to explore more flexible and adaptive search strategies.\n*   **Limited Preference Handling:** The system does not appear to effectively incorporate user preferences into its scheduling decisions. This significantly reduces the usefulness of the system, as it may propose solutions that are undesirable despite being technically feasible.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **CONSTRAINT HANDLING**. Addressing this weakness will have the most significant impact on the system's overall accuracy and its ability to find valid and acceptable meeting times. Improved constraint handling will also enable the system to effectively incorporate user preferences, leading to more satisfying solutions.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nImplement the following changes in the next iteration, prioritizing LLM-driven approaches:\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Time Interval Analysis:** Replace rule-based parsing and manual conflict checking with the `check_availability` function using LLM calls. This will allow the system to leverage the LLM's reasoning capabilities to accurately determine participant availability. This should be the first action.\n2.  **Introduce Multi-Agent Verification of Schedules:** Integrate the `verify_availability` function to create a verification agent that independently checks the system's availability determinations. This will serve as a check-and-balance system to catch errors in the primary constraint handling logic.\n3.  **Incorporate Preference Handling:** Modify the system to explicitly identify and prioritize user preferences. Introduce an LLM-driven function to rank potential time slots based on how well they align with stated preferences:\n    ```python\n    def rank_time_slots_by_preference(time_slots, preferences):\n        prompt = f\"Time Slots: {time_slots}\\nPreferences: {preferences}\\n\\nRank the time slots based on how well they meet the given preferences. Explain your reasoning for each ranking.\"\n        response = call_llm(prompt)\n        # Parse and return the ranked time slots\n        return parse_ranked_time_slots(response)\n    ```\n4.  **Monitor Performance Metrics:** Track the accuracy of the `check_availability` and `verify_availability` functions to identify specific areas where the constraint handling logic is failing. Additionally, begin tracking user satisfaction with proposed solutions to assess the effectiveness of preference handling.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance summary, the system's capabilities are currently **STABLE** at a low level. To shift this trend towards improvement, the actionable recommendations above must be implemented and their effectiveness carefully monitored. Implementing LLM-driven constraint handling is expected to significantly improve the system's performance. However, ongoing monitoring and iterative refinement will be necessary to sustain this trend and achieve substantial gains in overall capability.\n",

While its implementation is inaccurate, the system demonstrates awareness of the importance of constraint satisfaction.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** This is the most critical weakness, as it directly leads to incorrect solutions and failures to find valid meeting times. The system's inability to accurately determine conflicts renders its other efforts largely ineffective.\n*   **Fragile Solution Generation:** The system's difficulty in finding solutions, even with simple scheduling scenarios, indicates a lack of robustness in its core solution generation process. This suggests a need to explore more flexible and adaptive search strategies.\n*   **Limited Preference Handling:** The system does not appear to effectively incorporate user preferences into its scheduling decisions. This significantly reduces the usefulness of the system, as it may propose solutions that are undesirable despite being technically feasible.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **CONSTRAINT HANDLING**. Addressing this weakness will have the most significant impact on the system's overall accuracy and its ability to find valid and acceptable meeting times. Improved constraint handling will also enable the system to effectively incorporate user preferences, leading to more satisfying solutions.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nImplement the following changes in the next iteration, prioritizing LLM-driven approaches:\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Time Interval Analysis:** Replace rule-based parsing and manual conflict checking with the `check_availability` function using LLM calls. This will allow the system to leverage the LLM's reasoning capabilities to accurately determine participant availability. This should be the first action.\n2.  **Introduce Multi-Agent Verification of Schedules:** Integrate the `verify_availability` function to create a verification agent that independently checks the system's availability determinations. This will serve as a check-and-balance system to catch errors in the primary constraint handling logic.\n3.  **Incorporate Preference Handling:** Modify the system to explicitly identify and prioritize user preferences. Introduce an LLM-driven function to rank potential time slots based on how well they align with stated preferences:\n    ```python\n    def rank_time_slots_by_preference(time_slots, preferences):\n        prompt = f\"Time Slots: {time_slots}\\nPreferences: {preferences}\\n\\nRank the time slots based on how well they meet the given preferences. Explain your reasoning for each ranking.\"\n        response = call_llm(prompt)\n        # Parse and return the ranked time slots\n        return parse_ranked_time_slots(response)\n    ```\n4.  **Monitor Performance Metrics:** Track the accuracy of the `check_availability` and `verify_availability` functions to identify specific areas where the constraint handling logic is failing. Additionally, begin tracking user satisfaction with proposed solutions to assess the effectiveness of preference handling.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance summary, the system's capabilities are currently **STABLE** at a low level. To shift this trend towards improvement, the actionable recommendations above must be implemented and their effectiveness carefully monitored. Implementing LLM-driven constraint handling is expected to significantly improve the system's performance. However, ongoing monitoring and iterative refinement will be necessary to sustain this trend and achieve substantial gains in overall capability.\n"

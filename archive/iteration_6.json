  "approach_summary": "The script uses a structured, multi-agent approach to schedule meetings. It employs two agents: an Extraction Agent to extract meeting details and a Scheduling Agent to propose a meeting time; each agent has a specific system instruction. The `extract_meeting_info` function extracts details with multi-example prompting and verifies the extraction, using `call_llm` to communicate with the LLM. The `schedule_meeting` function then proposes a time and validates that proposed time before returning it. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `extract_meeting_info` followed by `schedule_meeting`, and handles any errors.",

Please use 'Here is the proposed time: \\[day], \\[start\\_time]-[end\\_time]'\"**: This is the most prevalent runtime error, appearing in samples 1, 2, and 3. This suggests a consistent issue in formatting the output according to the expected structure. It could be a problem with the prompt that guides the output formatting, or with a post-processing step.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Decomposition**: The system attempts to break down the scheduling problem into smaller, manageable parts (identifying participants, constraints, available time slots).\n*   **Constraint Recognition**: The system acknowledges and tries to incorporate the various constraints, such as participant availability, meeting duration, and preferred times.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Output Formatting**: The system frequently fails to produce the output in the required format, leading to runtime errors. This indicates a fragility in the output generation process.\n*   **Solution Generation Accuracy**: When the system *does* produce an answer, it is often incorrect, suggesting issues in correctly determining available time slots and satisfying all constraints simultaneously.\n*   **Constraint Handling**: The constraints related to people's schedules and preference for meetings on particular days are not being properly used to get to the golden answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Output Formatting Inconsistency**: The most critical bottleneck is the failure to consistently generate the output in the required format. This prevents the system from providing any valid solutions, even if the reasoning is partially correct.\n*   **Scheduling Logic**: The underlying logic for identifying available time slots and choosing a valid solution seems to have flaws and not consistently generate the correct answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Output Format**: A significant number of errors are caused by the output not matching the specified format, suggesting a prompt engineering or output parsing issue.\n*   **Incorrect Time Selection**: In cases where the output format is correct, the suggested time slot is often wrong, indicating a failure to correctly process the scheduling constraints.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **inconsistent and incorrect implementation of output formatting**. This is evident from the recurring \"Incorrect format\" error. A secondary, but still significant, issue is the incorrect scheduling logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting**: The system needs a more robust and reliable method for generating the output in the specified format.\n2.  **Constraint Handling**: Improve how the constraints related to schedules, participant preferences, and time-of-day requirements are being used.\n3.  **Scheduling Logic Accuracy**: The underlying algorithm for finding a valid meeting time needs to be more accurate and consider all constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Reinforce Output Formatting in Prompt**: Make the output formatting requirement crystal clear in the prompt, perhaps with multiple examples. Use few-shot examples to demonstrate the required output structure.\n2.  **Output Verification and Correction**: Implement a function that verifies the generated output against the required format and corrects it if necessary. This could involve regular expressions or another LLM call specifically for formatting.\n3.  **Enhanced Constraint Handling**: Employ chain-of-thought prompting to force the system to explicitly state each constraint being considered and how it's being applied in its reasoning.\n4.  **Refine Scheduling Algorithm**: Review and refine the algorithm used for finding a valid meeting time. Ensure that all constraints are being correctly considered and that the algorithm is robust to various scenarios. Add a constraint satisfaction agent.\n5.  **Implement unit tests**: To confirm the logic works.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0**: solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 1**: solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample 2**: solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample 3**: solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample 4**: solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your prompt:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs clearly demonstrate a significant problem with output formatting. Two of the three samples provided explicitly return an error message indicating an \"Incorrect format.\"  The one successful output gives a correct format \"Here is the proposed time: Monday, 10:00-10:30\". This output is not verified against the constraint handling, schedule etc. to determine if this proposed solution is indeed correct. The presence of this formatting error dominates the results and prevents us from accurately assessing the underlying scheduling logic. The errors indicate that the system has a problem with generating the specified output, in the format '[day], [start\\_time]-[end\\_time]'.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has extremely limited capability. While it attempts to address the core scheduling problem, the failure rate due to output formatting issues is 66%.  Even when an output is generated, the lack of validation in the provided outputs means the underlying scheduling logic cannot be assessed. This limits the ability to get to the golden answer.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Decomposition (Potential):** The system *attempts* to decompose the problem, which is valuable. This capability needs to be nurtured and improved, but represents a solid foundation. The solution\\_generation capability is also a strength.\n*   **Constraint Recognition (Potential):** Similarly, constraint recognition is a potential strength. The system needs to improve its ability to act on the constraints.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Output Formatting (Critical):** The *consistent* failure to adhere to the specified output format is the most critical weakness, as it prevents the system from delivering any value.\n*   **Solution Generation Accuracy (Significant):** Even if the output formatting problem is solved, the underlying scheduling logic is suspect.  Until the format is fixed, we can't be sure *how* inaccurate it is.\n*   **Constraint Handling (Significant):** The system does not handle the schedule related constraints or user preferences.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Output Formatting**. Without consistent output formatting, the system is essentially unusable. Once a high level of output formatting success is achieved, the scheduling and constraint handling logic can be assessed and improved.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a dedicated Output Formatting Agent:** Create a specialized agent whose sole responsibility is to take the output of the scheduling logic and format it correctly. This isolates the formatting task and allows for targeted improvements.\n    *   The agent would take the time, the proposed answer and constraints and apply those to the function.\n2.  **Few-Shot Prompting with Explicit Formatting Instructions:** Within the Output Formatting Agent, use few-shot examples in the prompt that *directly* demonstrate the desired output format. Include examples with variations in day and time. The examples should clearly show the correct output structure for both valid solutions *and* error cases.\n3.  **Output Verification within the Output Formatting Agent:**  Within the Output Formatting Agent, include a step to verify the output against the specified format. This could involve a simple regular expression check or, even better, another LLM call specifically designed to validate the format.  If the format is incorrect, the agent should re-format the output.\n4.  **Reinforce Output Formatting with System message**: Use system messages to further reinforce the output and error handling requirements.\n5.  **Add test cases to the output formatting agent**: The addition of comprehensive and varied test cases can help to identify areas for improvement.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **Stable (Low)**. The system consistently fails in output formatting. Until the output formatting is corrected, it will be impossible to observe the overall system trends. The next iteration MUST focus on output formatting.\n",

This prevents the system from providing any valid solutions, even if the reasoning is partially correct.\n*   **Scheduling Logic**: The underlying logic for identifying available time slots and choosing a valid solution seems to have flaws and not consistently generate the correct answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Output Format**: A significant number of errors are caused by the output not matching the specified format, suggesting a prompt engineering or output parsing issue.\n*   **Incorrect Time Selection**: In cases where the output format is correct, the suggested time slot is often wrong, indicating a failure to correctly process the scheduling constraints.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **inconsistent and incorrect implementation of output formatting**. This is evident from the recurring \"Incorrect format\" error. A secondary, but still significant, issue is the incorrect scheduling logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Output Formatting**: The system needs a more robust and reliable method for generating the output in the specified format.\n2.  **Constraint Handling**: Improve how the constraints related to schedules, participant preferences, and time-of-day requirements are being used.\n3.  **Scheduling Logic Accuracy**: The underlying algorithm for finding a valid meeting time needs to be more accurate and consider all constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Reinforce Output Formatting in Prompt**: Make the output formatting requirement crystal clear in the prompt, perhaps with multiple examples. Use few-shot examples to demonstrate the required output structure.\n2.  **Output Verification and Correction**: Implement a function that verifies the generated output against the required format and corrects it if necessary. This could involve regular expressions or another LLM call specifically for formatting.\n3.  **Enhanced Constraint Handling**: Employ chain-of-thought prompting to force the system to explicitly state each constraint being considered and how it's being applied in its reasoning.\n4.  **Refine Scheduling Algorithm**: Review and refine the algorithm used for finding a valid meeting time. Ensure that all constraints are being correctly considered and that the algorithm is robust to various scenarios. Add a constraint satisfaction agent.\n5.  **Implement unit tests**: To confirm the logic works.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0**: solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample 1**: solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample 2**: solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample 3**: solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample 4**: solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n",

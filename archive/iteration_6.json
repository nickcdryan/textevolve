  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting meeting details using `extract_meeting_info` with few-shot learning. Then, `find_available_slot` iteratively proposes meeting slots and validates them using the LLM, retrying if invalid. The `call_llm` function serves as the interface to the LLM, with a system instruction to guide its role. The workflow starts with `main` calling `extract_meeting_info`, then `find_available_slot` which calls `call_llm` to generate a proposed slot and validate against the extracted info.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error observed across all samples is: \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This error indicates a `JSONDecodeError`, meaning the system is failing to parse the expected JSON output. This suggests a critical issue in how the LLM is generating the output or how the system is attempting to parse it. It could be due to an empty string, malformed JSON, or the LLM returning plain text instead of JSON.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Problem Definition**: The prompts clearly define the task as scheduling meetings with specific constraints.\n2.  **Structured Input**: The input provides well-formatted schedules and constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **JSON Output Failure**: The system consistently fails to produce valid JSON output, leading to a `JSONDecodeError`. This appears to be a fundamental flaw preventing proper execution.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling**: The system does not appear to have robust error handling to catch the `JSONDecodeError` and recover gracefully. Instead, it abruptly stops with a generic error message.\n3.  **LLM Reliability**: The LLM doesn't seem reliable in following the output format.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **JSON Output Generation/Parsing**: The inability to consistently generate and parse valid JSON is the most critical bottleneck. This prevents the system from extracting and processing any information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is the `JSONDecodeError`, indicating a systemic problem with the LLM's JSON output or the system's parsing mechanism.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem to fix is ensuring that the LLM *reliably* generates valid JSON output and that the system has robust error handling to gracefully handle JSON parsing failures. The root cause is likely that the LLM is generating plain text or invalid JSON, which prevents the system from interpreting the result and continuing the problem-solving process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Prompting**: Improve the prompt to *force* the LLM to output valid JSON *every time*, including examples of correctly formatted JSON.\n2.  **JSON Parsing Error Handling**: Implement a `try-except` block around the JSON parsing code to catch `JSONDecodeError` and attempt to recover or provide a meaningful error message. If a JSON error occurs, attempt to re-prompt the LLM with a specific instruction to correct the JSON format.\n3. **Verification of output**: Add a verification step to check the LLM output and re-prompt if the structure is incorrect.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhance LLM Prompt**:\n    *   Include clear instructions in the prompt that the LLM *must* return a JSON object. Provide a specific schema to follow. For example: \"Return your answer as a JSON object with the following keys: 'day', 'start_time', 'end_time'. The values for these keys should be strings in the format 'Monday', 'HH:MM', 'HH:MM' respectively. If no meeting time can be found, return `{'day': null, 'start_time': null, 'end_time': null}`.\"\n    *   Add multiple examples of correctly formatted JSON output to the prompt. This will help the LLM understand the desired output format.\n    *   Include explicit negative constraints that forbid the LLM from including any additional text outside the JSON object.\n\n2.  **Implement JSON Parsing Error Handling**:\n    ```python\n    try:\n        data = json.loads(llm_output)\n    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n        # Attempt to re-prompt the LLM with an error message.\n        reprompt_message = \"Your previous response was not valid JSON. Please provide a valid JSON object with the keys 'day', 'start_time', and 'end_time'. If there are no results set keys to null. For example, `{'day': 'Monday', 'start_time': '14:00', 'end_time': '14:30'}` or if there are no possible meeting times return `{'day': null, 'start_time': null, 'end_time': null}`\"\n        llm_output = call_llm(reprompt_message)  # Assuming call_llm is the function to interact with the LLM\n        try:\n           data = json.loads(llm_output)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n           print (\"Could not recover, returning error\")\n           return \"Error: Could not determine valid meeting time\"\n\n    ```\n    *   This code adds a `try-except` block to catch `JSONDecodeError`. If the error occurs, it prints the error message and *attempts to re-prompt the LLM* with a specific instruction to correct the JSON format and *retries the parsing*. If reprompting fails, it returns a hardcoded error\n    *  Add a step to verify that LLM follows the correct JSON structure by checking for the required keys\n\n3.  **Robust Error Message**: If the `JSONDecodeError` cannot be resolved after re-prompting, return a more informative error message to the user indicating that the system was unable to parse the LLM's output.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0**: `information_extraction`, `constraint_handling`, `solution_generation`, `solution_verification`, `decision_making` all failed due to the JSON parsing error.\n*   **Sample 1**: `information_extraction`, `constraint_handling`, `solution_generation`, `solution_verification`, `decision_making` all failed due to the JSON parsing error.\n*   **Sample 2**: `information_extraction`, `constraint_handling`, `solution_generation`, `solution_verification`, `decision_making` all failed due to the JSON parsing error.\n*   **Sample 3**: `information_extraction`, `constraint_handling`, `solution_generation`, `solution_verification`, `decision_making` all failed due to the JSON parsing error.\n*   **Sample 4**: `information_extraction`, `constraint_handling`, `solution_generation`, `solution_verification`, `decision_making` all failed due to the JSON parsing error.\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines.\n\n```\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs clearly show a consistent failure: a `JSONDecodeError`. The error message \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" indicates that the LLM is returning an empty string or a non-JSON string when the system is expecting a JSON object. This happens in *every* sample, indicating a systemic problem rather than an isolated incident.  The lack of any other output suggests the system crashes immediately upon encountering this error, further demonstrating the lack of robust error handling. The system is essentially dead on arrival due to this parsing failure.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has *extremely limited capabilities*. While the prompts and input format are well-structured, the core function of processing information and generating a usable output *completely fails*. The inability to handle JSON output correctly renders the system non-functional.  The \"strengths\" listed are irrelevant because the system cannot progress past the initial JSON parsing stage.  Essentially, the system is *unable* to perform any of the listed capabilities due to this critical error.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\nGiven the current state, it's difficult to identify meaningful strengths. However, the prompt design and structured input *could* be considered potential strengths, but they are unrealized because the LLM consistently fails at the most basic step: generating valid JSON.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Catastrophic JSON Output Failure:** The LLM's inability to generate valid JSON is the *primary and most critical weakness*. This prevents any further processing.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The system's failure to gracefully handle `JSONDecodeError` leads to immediate termination, making debugging and recovery difficult.\n3.  **Output Verification Missing:** There is a lack of validation to check if the LLM's generated output follows the required structure.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **reliable JSON output generation**. Without this, no other capabilities can be developed or assessed.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Prompt Engineering - Enforce JSON Output:**\n    *   **Modify the LLM prompt to explicitly require JSON output and provide multiple examples**:  Use phrases like \"You *must* respond with a JSON object\", and \"Your response *must* be in the following format: `{'day': 'Monday', 'start_time': '10:00', 'end_time': '11:00'}`\".\n    *   **Use a schema definition**:  Include a clear schema definition in the prompt, specifying the data types and formats expected for each key.  For example: \"The JSON object *must* have keys 'day' (string), 'start_time' (string, HH:MM format), and 'end_time' (string, HH:MM format).\"\n    *  **Add negative constraints**: Explicity forbid any surrounding explanation: \"Do not output any text other than the JSON block\".\n    *   **Escalate the instruction**: Include warnings/penalties for not complying with the format\n\n2.  **Implement Robust JSON Parsing Error Handling and Reprompting:**\n    *   Implement the `try-except` block with reprompting as you've described, but add a *counter* to limit the number of reprompting attempts to avoid infinite loops. Add logging for debugging if the error persists after multiple retries. Add a key in reprompting indicating what failed, so the LLM knows to only regenerate the incorrect portion.\n\n    ```python\n    max_retries = 3\n    for attempt in range(max_retries):\n        try:\n            data = json.loads(llm_output)\n            # add a key verification\n            if 'day' in data and 'start_time' in data and 'end_time' in data:\n                break # Exit the loop if parsing is successful\n            else:\n                raise json.JSONDecodeError(\"Missing Keys\", doc=llm_output, pos=0)\n\n        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n            print(f\"JSONDecodeError (Attempt {attempt + 1}/{max_retries}): {e}\")\n            reprompt_message = f\"Your previous response was not valid JSON.  You MUST return a JSON object with the keys 'day', 'start_time', and 'end_time' in the format shown in the examples. Specifically fix the previous error {e}.  Attempt {attempt + 1}/{max_retries}\"\n            llm_output = call_llm(reprompt_message)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print (f\"General exception {e}\")\n            break # General exception.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe primary runtime error observed across all samples is: \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\". This error indicates a `JSONDecodeError`, meaning the system is failing to parse the expected JSON output. This suggests a critical issue in how the LLM is generating the output or how the system is attempting to parse it. It could be due to an empty string, malformed JSON, or the LLM returning plain text instead of JSON.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Clear Problem Definition**: The prompts clearly define the task as scheduling meetings with specific constraints.\n2.  **Structured Input**: The input provides well-formatted schedules and constraints.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **JSON Output Failure**: The system consistently fails to produce valid JSON output, leading to a `JSONDecodeError`. This appears to be a fundamental flaw preventing proper execution.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling**: The system does not appear to have robust error handling to catch the `JSONDecodeError` and recover gracefully. Instead, it abruptly stops with a generic error message.\n3.  **LLM Reliability**: The LLM doesn't seem reliable in following the output format.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **JSON Output Generation/Parsing**: The inability to consistently generate and parse valid JSON is the most critical bottleneck. This prevents the system from extracting and processing any information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe recurring pattern is the `JSONDecodeError`, indicating a systemic problem with the LLM's JSON output or the system's parsing mechanism.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem to fix is ensuring that the LLM *reliably* generates valid JSON output and that the system has robust error handling to gracefully handle JSON parsing failures. The root cause is likely that the LLM is generating plain text or invalid JSON, which prevents the system from interpreting the result and continuing the problem-solving process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **LLM Prompting**: Improve the prompt to *force* the LLM to output valid JSON *every time*, including examples of correctly formatted JSON.\n2.  **JSON Parsing Error Handling**: Implement a `try-except` block around the JSON parsing code to catch `JSONDecodeError` and attempt to recover or provide a meaningful error message. If a JSON error occurs, attempt to re-prompt the LLM with a specific instruction to correct the JSON format.\n3. **Verification of output**: Add a verification step to check the LLM output and re-prompt if the structure is incorrect.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhance LLM Prompt**:\n    *   Include clear instructions in the prompt that the LLM *must* return a JSON object. Provide a specific schema to follow. For example: \"Return your answer as a JSON object with the following keys: 'day', 'start_time', 'end_time'. The values for these keys should be strings in the format 'Monday', 'HH:MM', 'HH:MM' respectively. If no meeting time can be found, return `{'day': null, 'start_time': null, 'end_time': null}`.\"\n    *   Add multiple examples of correctly formatted JSON output to the prompt. This will help the LLM understand the desired output format.\n    *   Include explicit negative constraints that forbid the LLM from including any additional text outside the JSON object.\n\n2.  **Implement JSON Parsing Error Handling**:\n    ```python\n    try:\n        data = json.loads(llm_output)\n    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(f\"JSONDecodeError: {e}\")\n        # Attempt to re-prompt the LLM with an error message.\n        reprompt_message = \"Your previous response was not valid JSON. Please provide a valid JSON object with the keys 'day', 'start_time', and 'end_time'. If there are no results set keys to null. For example, `{'day': 'Monday', 'start_time': '14:00', 'end_time': '14:30'}` or if there are no possible meeting times return `{'day': null, 'start_time': null, 'end_time': null}`\"\n        llm_output = call_llm(reprompt_message)  # Assuming call_llm is the function to interact with the LLM\n        try:\n           data = json.loads(llm_output)\n        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n           print (\"Could not recover, returning error\")\n           return \"Error: Could not determine valid meeting time\"\n\n    ```\n    *   This code adds a `try-except` block to catch `JSONDecodeError`. If the error occurs, it prints the error message and *attempts to re-prompt the LLM* with a specific instruction to correct the JSON format and *retries the parsing*. If reprompting fails, it returns a hardcoded error\n    *  Add a step to verify that LLM follows the correct JSON structure by checking for the required keys\n\n3.  **Robust Error Message**: If the `JSONDecodeError` cannot be resolved after re-prompting, return a more informative error message to the user indicating that the system was unable to parse the LLM's output.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0**: `information_extraction`, `constraint_handling`, `solution_generation`, `solution_verification`, `decision_making` all failed due to the JSON parsing error.\n*   **Sample 1**: `information_extraction`, `constraint_handling`, `solution_generation`, `solution_verification`, `decision_making` all failed due to the JSON parsing error.\n*   **Sample 2**: `information_extraction`, `constraint_handling`, `solution_generation`, `solution_verification`, `decision_making` all failed due to the JSON parsing error.\n*   **Sample 3**: `information_extraction`, `constraint_handling`, `solution_generation`, `solution_verification`, `decision_making` all failed due to the JSON parsing error.\n*   **Sample 4**: `information_extraction`, `constraint_handling`, `solution_generation`, `solution_verification`, `decision_making` all failed due to the JSON parsing error.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your guidelines.\n\n```\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs clearly show a consistent failure: a `JSONDecodeError`. The error message \"Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)\" indicates that the LLM is returning an empty string or a non-JSON string when the system is expecting a JSON object. This happens in *every* sample, indicating a systemic problem rather than an isolated incident.  The lack of any other output suggests the system crashes immediately upon encountering this error, further demonstrating the lack of robust error handling. The system is essentially dead on arrival due to this parsing failure.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has *extremely limited capabilities*. While the prompts and input format are well-structured, the core function of processing information and generating a usable output *completely fails*. The inability to handle JSON output correctly renders the system non-functional.  The \"strengths\" listed are irrelevant because the system cannot progress past the initial JSON parsing stage.  Essentially, the system is *unable* to perform any of the listed capabilities due to this critical error.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\nGiven the current state, it's difficult to identify meaningful strengths. However, the prompt design and structured input *could* be considered potential strengths, but they are unrealized because the LLM consistently fails at the most basic step: generating valid JSON.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Catastrophic JSON Output Failure:** The LLM's inability to generate valid JSON is the *primary and most critical weakness*. This prevents any further processing.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling:** The system's failure to gracefully handle `JSONDecodeError` leads to immediate termination, making debugging and recovery difficult.\n3.  **Output Verification Missing:** There is a lack of validation to check if the LLM's generated output follows the required structure.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **reliable JSON output generation**. Without this, no other capabilities can be developed or assessed.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Prompt Engineering - Enforce JSON Output:**\n    *   **Modify the LLM prompt to explicitly require JSON output and provide multiple examples**:  Use phrases like \"You *must* respond with a JSON object\", and \"Your response *must* be in the following format: `{'day': 'Monday', 'start_time': '10:00', 'end_time': '11:00'}`\".\n    *   **Use a schema definition**:  Include a clear schema definition in the prompt, specifying the data types and formats expected for each key.  For example: \"The JSON object *must* have keys 'day' (string), 'start_time' (string, HH:MM format), and 'end_time' (string, HH:MM format).\"\n    *  **Add negative constraints**: Explicity forbid any surrounding explanation: \"Do not output any text other than the JSON block\".\n    *   **Escalate the instruction**: Include warnings/penalties for not complying with the format\n\n2.  **Implement Robust JSON Parsing Error Handling and Reprompting:**\n    *   Implement the `try-except` block with reprompting as you've described, but add a *counter* to limit the number of reprompting attempts to avoid infinite loops. Add logging for debugging if the error persists after multiple retries. Add a key in reprompting indicating what failed, so the LLM knows to only regenerate the incorrect portion.\n\n    ```python\n    max_retries = 3\n    for attempt in range(max_retries):\n        try:\n            data = json.loads(llm_output)\n            # add a key verification\n            if 'day' in data and 'start_time' in data and 'end_time' in data:\n                break # Exit the loop if parsing is successful\n            else:\n                raise json.JSONDecodeError(\"Missing Keys\", doc=llm_output, pos=0)\n\n        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n            print(f\"JSONDecodeError (Attempt {attempt + 1}/{max_retries}): {e}\")\n            reprompt_message = f\"Your previous response was not valid JSON.  You MUST return a JSON object with the keys 'day', 'start_time', and 'end_time' in the format shown in the examples. Specifically fix the previous error {e}.  Attempt {attempt + 1}/{max_retries}\"\n            llm_output = call_llm(reprompt_message)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print (f\"General exception {e}\")\n            break # General exception. Nothing more to be done\n    else:  # This 'else' belongs to the 'for' loop and executes if the loop completes without a 'break'\n        print(\"Could not recover after multiple retries.\")\n        return \"Error: Could not determine valid meeting time after multiple attempts.\"\n\n    ```\n\n3.  **Add LLM Output Verification:**\n    *   After parsing, *verify* the structure of the JSON object.  Ensure that the expected keys ('day', 'start_time', 'end_time') are present and have the correct data types (strings).  If the structure is incorrect, trigger a reprompt with specific feedback.\n\n4.  **Improve Error Messaging:**\n    *   If JSON parsing consistently fails, provide a user-friendly error message that explains the problem and suggests potential solutions (e.g., \"The system was unable to understand the response from the AI.  Please try again or contact support.\").\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capabilities are currently **stable at zero**.  There is no improvement or decline because the system consistently fails at the first step.\n\n```\n\nThis assessment highlights the critical need to address the JSON output failure before any other improvements can be made. The actionable recommendations focus on prompt engineering to *force* JSON output, robust error handling with reprompting, and output verification to ensure the LLM follows the required structure.\n"

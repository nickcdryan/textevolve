  "approach_summary": "The script uses the Gemini LLM to solve grid transformation problems by first analyzing a transformation pattern from given examples and then applying it to a test input. It decomposes the problem into identifying the pattern and then applying it. Two agent roles are implicitly defined through system instructions: one for analyzing transformation patterns and another for applying them. The function `call_llm` makes calls to the Gemini API, `analyze_transformation_pattern` gets the transformation description, `apply_transformation` applies the transformation, and `main` orchestrates the process by parsing the input, calling the analysis and transformation functions, and returning the final transformed grid.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo explicit runtime errors (like JSONDecodeError, TypeError) were found in the 'output' fields. The code executes without crashing, but produces incorrect results.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can generate Python code to process and transform grid data.\n*   **Constraint Handling (Basic):** The generated code includes basic boundary checks to avoid index out-of-range errors.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to accurately infer the underlying transformation patterns from the training examples. It often implements overly simplistic or incorrect rules.\n*   **Generalization:** The system fails to generalize the learned patterns to the test input, resulting in incorrect transformations.\n*   **Grid Dimensionality Handling:** The system does not properly handle different grid dimensions between training and test inputs (e.g. outputs the entire transformed grid instead of extracting the desired sub-grid).\n*   **Transformation Logic Errors:** The coded transformation logic is often flawed, applying incorrect rules or conditions.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inferring Correct Transformation Logic:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to accurately derive the transformation pattern from the given training examples and translate it into effective code.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Rules:** The generated code often implements rules that are only partially correct or completely wrong based on the training data. In sample 1, the code seems to want to fill the entire matrix, rather than apply some targeted transformation, and in sample 2, applies a single transformation rule independent of others. Sample 3 attempts to get a little more complex with its transformations, but seems to misinterpret where `9`'s are in relation to the `1`.\n*   **Failure to Adapt Grid Size/Shape:** The code outputs a grid that matches the dimensions of the *input* grid in the test case, while the expected *output* in the training examples is only a sub-grid within the original input grid. The transformation logic is being applied correctly, but it is not following the dimensions implied by the transformation in the training examples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **incorrect pattern recognition and faulty implementation of transformation logic based on those patterns**. The system fails to accurately identify and translate the relationship between input and output grids, resulting in flawed code that produces incorrect results. Also, it fails to take into account the *change* in dimensionality between the input and output training cases.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's ability to identify and abstract the transformation patterns from training examples.\n*   **Code Generation:** Refine the code generation process to ensure that the generated code accurately reflects the identified transformation pattern.\n*   **Dimensionality Awareness:** Add logic to consider the difference in the dimension of the output and input training examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Pattern Extraction:** Implement more sophisticated techniques (e.g., image processing techniques, convolutional neural networks) to extract features and relationships from the input and output grids. Consider adding a module specifically to detect grid size/shape changes as a part of the transformation.\n2.  **Abstract Rule Representation:** Develop an intermediate representation (e.g., a set of logical rules or a decision tree) to capture the identified transformation pattern. This representation can then be used to guide code generation.\n3.  **Code Verification with Training Data:** Before applying the transformation to the test input, rigorously verify the generated code against the training examples. This could involve automatically generating test cases from the training data and comparing the code's output to the expected output. This could be accomplished through checking if the training data passes as an assertion, or by measuring some statistical value (for example, \"error\" in training predictions) before running test input.\n4.  **Debugging Output:** Add print statements at key points in the generated code (e.g., after applying each transformation rule) to provide more insights into the system's reasoning process. This will help in identifying the source of errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the pattern of how input grid values translate to output grid values.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect output grid.\n    *   solution_verification: Did not verify the answer correctly.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the pattern of how input grid values translate to output grid values.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated incorrect code to calculate the new output.\n    *   solution_verification: Did not verify the answer correctly.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the pattern of how input grid values translate to output grid values.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated incorrect code to calculate the new output.\n    *   solution_verification: Did not verify the answer correctly.\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**AI System:** Grid Transformation AI\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**Version:** Initial Report\n\n### PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system outputs a grid filled with transformed values that bear no apparent relation to the transformation pattern evident in training cases. The dimensions of the grid are those of the input, not the output training case. The response is not formatted as code.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system generated correct Python code. The transformation logic in the code, however, seems simplistic and applies the same modification (setting the cell above to '4') based on the value of the original grid cell. The dimensions of the grid are those of the input, not the output training case.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system generated correct Python code. The transformation logic in the code checks for neighbors of `1`s, and if a neighbor is a `9`, replaces that neighbor with an `8`. The dimensions of the grid are those of the input, not the output training case.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates a very low capability in solving grid transformation problems. While it can generate syntactically correct Python code and incorporates some basic constraint handling, it fails to accurately infer the underlying transformation patterns from the training examples and apply them correctly to the test input. A key issue is the lack of understanding or handling of changes in grid dimensionality between input and output in the training data.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can generate Python code that generally executes without runtime errors.\n*   **Constraint Handling (Basic):** The system can implement basic boundary checks to prevent out-of-bounds errors.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to identify and abstract the underlying transformation patterns from the training data.\n*   **Generalization:** The system fails to generalize learned patterns to new input grids.\n*   **Grid Dimensionality Handling:** The system does not properly handle changes in grid dimensions between training input and output.\n*   **Transformation Logic:** The generated code often implements incorrect or overly simplistic transformation logic.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition**, specifically the ability to accurately identify and translate the relationship between input and output grids, taking into account dimensionality changes.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Pattern Extraction (Grid Size Change Detection):** Modify the pattern extraction module to explicitly detect and incorporate changes in grid size/shape as a key part of the transformation pattern. This might involve identifying specific regions or sub-grids within the input that map to the output.\n2.  **Intermediate Rule Representation (Dimensionality Aware):** Revise the intermediate rule representation to explicitly capture the input-output grid size/shape relationship. This representation should then be used to guide code generation, ensuring that the generated code correctly handles dimensionality changes. For example, the rule representation could include information about which portion of the transformed grid is expected as an output.\n3.  **Code Verification with Training Data (Automated Test Case Generation):** Implement automated test case generation from the training data. Before applying the transformation to the test input, the generated code *must* be verified against these test cases to ensure that it produces the correct output for the training examples. This means creating input and output pairs from training data, running generated code on training input, and verifying that the output closely matches the expected output. Implement assertions to confirm the veracity of this process.\n4.  **Debugging Output (Grid Visualizations):** Add debugging output that visualizes the grid transformations at each step. This could involve printing the grid after each transformation rule is applied. When verifying the code with training data, this will help to visually identify where the transformation logic is failing.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable (very low)**. Without significant improvements in pattern recognition and handling grid dimensionality changes, the system will continue to perform poorly on grid transformation problems.\n",

It often implements overly simplistic or incorrect rules.\n*   **Generalization:** The system fails to generalize the learned patterns to the test input, resulting in incorrect transformations.\n*   **Grid Dimensionality Handling:** The system does not properly handle different grid dimensions between training and test inputs (e.g. outputs the entire transformed grid instead of extracting the desired sub-grid).\n*   **Transformation Logic Errors:** The coded transformation logic is often flawed, applying incorrect rules or conditions.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inferring Correct Transformation Logic:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to accurately derive the transformation pattern from the given training examples and translate it into effective code.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Transformation Rules:** The generated code often implements rules that are only partially correct or completely wrong based on the training data. In sample 1, the code seems to want to fill the entire matrix, rather than apply some targeted transformation, and in sample 2, applies a single transformation rule independent of others. Sample 3 attempts to get a little more complex with its transformations, but seems to misinterpret where `9`'s are in relation to the `1`.\n*   **Failure to Adapt Grid Size/Shape:** The code outputs a grid that matches the dimensions of the *input* grid in the test case, while the expected *output* in the training examples is only a sub-grid within the original input grid. The transformation logic is being applied correctly, but it is not following the dimensions implied by the transformation in the training examples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **incorrect pattern recognition and faulty implementation of transformation logic based on those patterns**. The system fails to accurately identify and translate the relationship between input and output grids, resulting in flawed code that produces incorrect results. Also, it fails to take into account the *change* in dimensionality between the input and output training cases.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's ability to identify and abstract the transformation patterns from training examples.\n*   **Code Generation:** Refine the code generation process to ensure that the generated code accurately reflects the identified transformation pattern.\n*   **Dimensionality Awareness:** Add logic to consider the difference in the dimension of the output and input training examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Enhanced Pattern Extraction:** Implement more sophisticated techniques (e.g., image processing techniques, convolutional neural networks) to extract features and relationships from the input and output grids. Consider adding a module specifically to detect grid size/shape changes as a part of the transformation.\n2.  **Abstract Rule Representation:** Develop an intermediate representation (e.g., a set of logical rules or a decision tree) to capture the identified transformation pattern. This representation can then be used to guide code generation.\n3.  **Code Verification with Training Data:** Before applying the transformation to the test input, rigorously verify the generated code against the training examples. This could involve automatically generating test cases from the training data and comparing the code's output to the expected output. This could be accomplished through checking if the training data passes as an assertion, or by measuring some statistical value (for example, \"error\" in training predictions) before running test input.\n4.  **Debugging Output:** Add print statements at key points in the generated code (e.g., after applying each transformation rule) to provide more insights into the system's reasoning process. This will help in identifying the source of errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the pattern of how input grid values translate to output grid values.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect output grid.\n    *   solution_verification: Did not verify the answer correctly.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the pattern of how input grid values translate to output grid values.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated incorrect code to calculate the new output.\n    *   solution_verification: Did not verify the answer correctly.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed to extract the pattern of how input grid values translate to output grid values.\n    *   solution_generation: Generated incorrect code to calculate the new output.\n    *   solution_verification: Did not verify the answer correctly.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script uses chain-of-thought reasoning with a question decomposition, information extraction, and answer synthesis approach, where each step is validated by the LLM. It leverages three agent roles: question decomposer, information extraction expert, and answer synthesis expert, each guided by specific system instructions. The overall workflow involves `main` calling `decompose_question` to break down the question, then `extract_information` to find relevant information, and finally `synthesize_answer` to generate the final answer. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini model, while the other functions decompose the problem and provide prompts to the LLM.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: This Week 12 showdown between the Colts and Eagles was originally scheduled for 1:00 ET, but due to the NFL's \"flexible-scheduling\" system this year, the NFL moved the game to Sunday night at 8:15 ET. This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game. During this game, the Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea, TE Dallas Clark and OT Ryan Diem all to injuries in the first half, and they did not return.\n\nQUESTION: How many touchdowns did Joseph Addai score in the first half?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Following a shocking loss to the 3-7 Kansas City Chiefs the previous week, the Steelers traveled to M&T Bank Stadium for another divisional game. Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Following a tough road loss against the Bears, the Steelers flew to Paul Brown Stadium for a Week 3 AFC North duel with the Cincinnati Bengals.  Pittsburgh would strike first in the first quarter with kicker Jeff Reed's 19-yard field goal and quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's 27-yard touchdown pass to running back Willie Parker.  The Steelers would add onto their lead in the second quarter as Reed made a 34-yard field goal.  The Bengals would close out the half with kicker Shayne Graham's 34-yard field goal. Cincinnati would creep closer in the third quarter as cornerback Johnathan Joseph returned an interception 30&#160;yards for a touchdown (with a failed PAT), yet Pittsburgh answered with Roethlisberger's 1-yard touchdown run.  However, in the fourth quarter, the Bengals took the lead with running back Cedric Benson's 23-yard touchdown run (with a failed 2-point conversion) and quarterback Carson Palmer's 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Andre Caldwell (with a successful 2-point conversion pass to running back Brian Leonard).

This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game. During this game, the Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea, TE Dallas Clark and OT Ryan Diem all to injuries in the first half, and they did not return.",

Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game.

In Franconia, the margraves of Ansbach and Bayreuth as well as the imperial cities were part of this alliance. The Catholic side responded in 1609 with a counter-alliance, the League. The conflicts between the two camps ultimately resulted in the Thirty Years' War, which was the greatest strain on the cohesion of the Franconian Circle Initially, Franconia was not a theatre of war, although marauding armies repeatedly crossed its territory. However, in 1631, Swedish troops under Gustavus Adolphus advanced into Franconia and established a large encampment in summer 1632 around Nuremberg. However, the Swedes lost the Battle of the Alte Veste against Wallenstein's troops and eventually withdrew. Franconia was one of the poorest regions in the Empire and lost its imperial political significance. During the course of the war, about half the local population lost their lives. To compensate for these losses about 150,000\u00a0displaced Protestants settled in Protestant areas, including Austrian exiles.",

For example, in sample 0 (a successful case), it correctly identifies the total number of workers and marginal cultivators.\n2. **Accurate Arithmetic Calculation:** The system generally performs the arithmetic calculations correctly, as seen in several successful cases like sample 0, 1, 2 and 6.\n3. **Logical Reasoning (Basic):** In many cases, the system successfully identifies the required operation (addition, subtraction) based on the question's wording and performs it correctly (seen in successes).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Arithmetic Errors:** Despite generally performing calculations correctly, the system makes mistakes in basic arithmetic in some cases (e.g., adding 9 and 11 to get 20 instead of 21 in sample 4).\n2. **Unit Confusion:** The system sometimes includes unnecessary units (like \"%\") in the final answer, making it technically incorrect even if the number is right (sample 8).\n3. **Lack of Thorough Verification:** Even when the system's intermediate steps are correct, the final answer can be wrong due to simple errors or misinterpretation, which indicates a weakness in verifying the final result.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Arithmetic Calculation Errors:** Even seemingly simple arithmetic calculations are proving to be a bottleneck.\n2. **Lack of rigorous final verification:** This leads to answers that are numerically correct but formatted incorrectly (e.g. including a percentage sign).\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Incorrect Final Calculation:** The initial calculations can be correct, but the final answer derived from those intermediate steps is incorrect, suggesting issues in the final aggregation or transformation of results (sample 4).\n2. **Inconsistent Units:** Inconsistency in handling units (e.g., including percentage signs when not needed or not including them when necessary), affecting the overall accuracy of the final response (sample 8).\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is **inconsistent and unreliable arithmetic calculation, compounded by a lack of rigorous answer verification before output**. Even simple addition or subtraction sometimes fails, and the system doesn't catch these errors before finalizing the answer. This, coupled with inconsistent unit handling, reduces the trustworthiness of the entire process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Arithmetic Calculation Reliability:** Enhance the reliability of arithmetic operations, possibly by using dedicated calculation modules or libraries and double-checking results.\n2. **Answer Verification and Validation:** Implement a robust verification step before outputting the final answer. This step should check for logical consistency, numerical accuracy, and correct units.\n3. **Unit Handling Consistency:** Standardize the handling of units (percentages, etc.) to ensure they are included or excluded appropriately and consistently.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a Post-Calculation Verification Step:** Before returning the final answer, add a module that re-calculates the answer from the extracted information and compares it to the initially derived answer. If there's a discrepancy, log the error and attempt to correct it or flag the answer as potentially incorrect.\n2. **Employ a Unit Management Module:** Use a unit management module to track and appropriately add units (e.g., \"men\", \"%\", \"yards\") to numeric values. This module should understand when units are necessary and automatically append them to the final output. The rules for addition/subtraction with units should be clearly defined (e.g., only add values with the same units).\n3. **Introduce Unit Tests for Arithmetic Operations:** Create a comprehensive set of unit tests specifically for the arithmetic calculation module. These tests should cover a wide range of scenarios, including different types of numbers (integers, decimals), operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and units (percentages, yards, points, etc.).\n4. **Enhanced Logging and Debugging:** Include additional logging statements at each step of the process (information extraction, calculation, answer generation) to trace the system's reasoning and identify the source of errors.

Let's analyze them:\n\n*   **Output 1: \"9,519 - 24 = 9,495\\nFinal Answer: 9,495\"** This execution looks correct. It shows the calculation step and the final answer. There are no obvious unit confusions here.\n*   **Output 2: \"3 touchdowns\"** This execution also appears correct. It directly answers the question without intermediate calculations, suggesting the system can correctly identify when calculations are *not* needed.\n*   **Output 3: \"First, calculate the total points scored by the Ravens: 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 18 points\\nNext, calculate the total points scored by the Steelers: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 points\\nFinally, calculate the difference between the Ravens' score and the Steelers' score: 18 - 15 = 3 points\\n\\nFinal Answer: 3 points\"**  This output showcases the system's ability to break down a problem into multiple steps and then perform the necessary calculations. It also demonstrates appropriate unit handling (\"points\").\n\n**Observations from Sample Outputs:**\n\n*   The system can generate intermediate calculation steps and present them in a clear, readable format.\n*   Unit handling can be context-dependent (e.g., including \"points\" but not specifying the unit after \"9,495\"). This indicates a degree of adaptability, but also a potential source of inconsistency.\n*   The system can directly provide answers when no calculations are needed.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a baseline capability in performing arithmetic reasoning based on textual input. It can extract relevant information, perform basic arithmetic operations, and present the results in a structured manner. However, the accuracy is hampered by arithmetic errors and inconsistencies in unit handling. The system excels in structured tasks but stumbles in the \"last mile\" of ensuring correctness.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Consistently and accurately identifies numerical data from the input text.\n*   **Multi-Step Reasoning:** Capable of breaking down problems into multiple calculation steps.\n*   **Generally Correct Arithmetic:** Performs correct calculations in the majority of cases.\n*   **Contextual Unit Handling:** Demonstrates some understanding of when to include or exclude units.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Arithmetic Errors:** Despite generally performing calculations correctly, the system makes mistakes in basic arithmetic.\n*   **Inconsistent Unit Handling:** Inconsistencies in unit usage, especially the presence of extraneous units or the absence of required units.\n*   **Lack of Rigorous Verification:** Insufficient checking of the final answer, even when intermediate steps are correct.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **arithmetic calculation reliability and final answer verification**. Increasing the accuracy and consistency of calculations is paramount to improving the system's overall trustworthiness.  Simultaneously, verifying the correctness, completeness, and formatting of the final answer is critical.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Post-Calculation Verification Module with Error Logging:**\n    *   Develop a separate module that independently recalculates the answer based on extracted numbers and operations.\n    *   If the recalculated answer differs from the system's initial result, log the discrepancy with detailed information (input text, extracted numbers, attempted operation, expected result, actual result).\n    *   Introduce a confidence score based on this module and flag low confidence answers to a human for review.\n2.  **Introduce Assertions in the Code:**\n    *   Add `assert` statements throughout the calculation process to check for expected values and conditions. For example, `assert sum >= a and sum >= b, \"Sum is less than one of the addends!\"` would help catch addition errors.\n    *   These assertions should be configurable for different levels of strictness and detail.\n3.  **Refine Unit Management with a Unit Ontology:**\n    *   Replace the current ad-hoc unit handling with a more structured approach using a defined unit ontology.\n    *   This ontology should specify acceptable units, conversion rules (if needed), and rules for unit addition, subtraction, etc.\n    *   For example, if the question asks for a distance in miles, the system should automatically convert any distances given in yards to miles before performing calculations.\n4.  **Augment Unit Tests with Edge Cases:**\n    *   Expand the unit test suite to include more edge cases and boundary conditions, especially those related to unit handling.\n    *   Specifically test scenarios with:\n        *   Mixed units (e.g., adding feet and inches).\n        *   Implicit units (e.g., \"5\" could mean different things depending on the context).\n        *   Zero values and negative numbers.\n5. **Implement Regular Expression Validation:**\n    * Create Regex patterns to validate the answer's format and ensure that the units are correct (e.g. no percentage signs or currencies if they are not expected)\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current assessment, the capability trend is currently **stable with potential for improvement**. The system has a solid foundation, but the identified weaknesses are preventing it from reaching its full potential. Implementing the above actionable recommendations should lead to a positive trend in future iterations.\n",

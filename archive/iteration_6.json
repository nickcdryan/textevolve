  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM with chain-of-thought prompting to solve grid transformation problems by extracting patterns from examples, explicitly inferring output dimensions, and applying transformations. The problem is decomposed into extraction, dimension inference, transformation, and verification steps. The LLM acts as an expert in grid transformation tasks. The script uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API and `solve_grid_transformation` to orchestrate the transformation process by calling `call_llm` with a specified prompt and system instruction. The overall workflow involves extracting information from the problem description, inferring dimensions and transformation rules, applying the rule to transform the input grid, and finally verifying the transformed grid for correctness.",

      "answer": "Okay, I understand the task. I need to apply a localized transformation rule to the given input grid and produce an output grid of specified dimensions. The core challenge is to correctly implement the localized rule while expanding the grid to the desired size.\n\nHere's how I'll approach this:\n\n1. **Understand the Rule:** The rule states that if a '4' is directly above a '3', they swap positions. Otherwise, the original values are retained.\n\n2. **Handle Input Grid:** The provided input grid is [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\n3. **Determine Output Grid Dimensions:**  The output grid must be 19x26.\n\n4. **Apply the Rule and Expansion:** Since the input grid contains only '0's, there are no '4's above '3's. Therefore, the rule will not cause any swaps. The output grid should be filled with '0's.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Grid:** Create a 19x26 grid filled with zeros.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid, output_rows, output_cols):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a localized transformation rule and expands the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input grid (list of lists).\n        output_rows: The number of rows in the output grid.\n        output_cols: The number of columns in the output grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new grid (list of lists) representing the transformed and expanded grid.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(output_cols)] for _ in range(output_rows)]\n    return output_grid\n\n\ninput_grid = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\noutput_rows = 19\noutput_cols = 26\n\ntransformed_grid = transform_grid(input_grid, output_rows, output_cols)\n\n# Print the transformed grid (optional)\n# for row in transformed_grid:\n#     print(row)\n```\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```",

        "system_answer": "Okay, I understand the task. I need to apply a localized transformation rule to the given input grid and produce an output grid of specified dimensions. The core challenge is to correctly implement the localized rule while expanding the grid to the desired size.\n\nHere's how I'll approach this:\n\n1. **Understand the Rule:** The rule states that if a '4' is directly above a '3', they swap positions. Otherwise, the original values are retained.\n\n2. **Handle Input Grid:** The provided input grid is [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]].\n\n3. **Determine Output Grid Dimensions:**  The output grid must be 19x26.\n\n4. **Apply the Rule and Expansion:** Since the input grid contains only '0's, there are no '4's above '3's. Therefore, the rule will not cause any swaps. The output grid should be filled with '0's.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Grid:** Create a 19x26 grid filled with zeros.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid, output_rows, output_cols):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a localized transformation rule and expands the grid.\n\n    Args:\n        input_grid: The input grid (list of lists).\n        output_rows: The number of rows in the output grid.\n        output_cols: The number of columns in the output grid.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new grid (list of lists) representing the transformed and expanded grid.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(output_cols)] for _ in range(output_rows)]\n    return output_grid\n\n\ninput_grid = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\noutput_rows = 19\noutput_cols = 26\n\ntransformed_grid = transform_grid(input_grid, output_rows, output_cols)\n\n# Print the transformed grid (optional)\n# for row in transformed_grid:\n#     print(row)\n```\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo explicit runtime errors (like JSONDecodeError or TypeError) were found in the 'output' fields. However, there's a recurring pattern of the system producing an incorrect or defaulting to a zero-filled grid, indicating a logical error in applying the inferred rule.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system appears capable of extracting the relevant information from the training examples, including the input and output grids. It represents this information in a JSON format.\n*   **Dimension Inference:** The system correctly infers the output grid dimensions in most cases, as shown by the \"Dimension Inference Result\" in the output field.\n*   **Rule Localization:** The system attempts to localize the transformation rule, which is a necessary step for solving these grid transformation problems.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Rule Application:** The primary weakness lies in the incorrect application of the localized rule to the test input. This often results in a grid filled with zeros, failing to capture the actual transformation pattern.\n*   **Over-Simplification:** The system seems to oversimplify the rule, leading to it failing to capture the nuances of the transformations demonstrated in the training examples. In Sample 1 and 2 it identified the wrong rule.\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** A critical bottleneck is the system's inability to effectively recognize and generalize transformation patterns from the training examples to the test input. It fails to connect specific input features (e.g., the presence and relative positions of numbers like 1, 2, 3, and 4) to the correct output transformations.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Inaccurate Rule Generalization:** The system fails to generalize the transformation rules effectively from the training examples. It often misinterprets or oversimplifies the patterns, leading to incorrect transformations on the test input.\n*   **Lack of Spatial Reasoning:** The system demonstrates a limited capability for spatial reasoning about the grid. It struggles to understand how elements within the grid relate to each other spatially and how transformations affect these spatial relationships.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Defaulting to Zero-Filled Grids:** A recurring error pattern is the system defaulting to outputting a grid filled with zeros. This indicates a failure to identify and apply the correct transformation rule, leading to a trivial, incorrect solution.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Rule Logic:** The system often misinterprets the relationship between the input and output grids, leading to a faulty localized rule. For example, sample 1's stated rule \"if a column contains a 1, 2, or 3, the corresponding output grid column should be filled with that number\" is nowhere near the actual rule.\n*   **Ignoring Input Details:** The systems appears to generate a canned response that ignores the values in the provided Test Input Grid and instead uses placeholder values.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **inaccurate generalization of transformation rules from the training examples.** The system is not effectively learning the underlying patterns and relationships between input and output grids, causing it to produce incorrect or trivial solutions. The canned response indicates an additional problem with incorrect inputs used in the response.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Rule Learning:** Improve the system's ability to learn and generalize transformation rules from the training examples. This may involve exploring different machine learning techniques, such as few-shot learning or meta-learning.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Enhance the system's spatial reasoning capabilities to better understand the relationships between elements in the grid and how transformations affect these relationships.\n*   **Debugging/Print Statements:** Add print statements that output the data the system is using, especially the actual values it has extracted from the input grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Implement a more robust rule learning algorithm:** Explore few-shot learning techniques or meta-learning approaches to improve the system's ability to generalize from a limited number of training examples.\n*   **Incorporate spatial reasoning techniques:** Implement algorithms that can analyze the spatial relationships between elements in the grid, such as convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks.\n*   **Increase the number of training examples:** Providing the system with a larger and more diverse set of training examples may help it learn more complex transformation patterns.\n*   **Add \"print\" statements:** At various points in the execution, add print statements to show the current values of the data being manipulated.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly extracted input grid for analysis)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generated all zeros grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify the correct pattern)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (made a decision resulting in an incorrect solution)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly extracted input grid for analysis)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generated all zeros grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify the correct pattern)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (made a decision resulting in an incorrect solution)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (unable to transform)\n    *   solution_verification: N/A\n    *   decision_making: N/A\n",

      "text_report": "Here's a comprehensive capability report for the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and instructions:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Incorrect Input to Rule Application:** The system consistently hallucinates a simplified 3x3 input grid `[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]` for the \"Transformed Grid\" stage, regardless of the actual test input provided. This indicates a serious flaw in how the system passes data between components. The 'Extracted Info' shows that the test input is correctly parsed and stored. The 'Dimension Inference Result' and 'Localized Rule' show that the test input is used at least partially correctly. But the 'Transformed Grid' section throws away all of that information and makes up an incorrect input grid.\n*   **Rule Misinterpretation and Oversimplification:** Even when the system infers the rule, the description of the rule is sometimes incorrect (e.g. Sample 1). In other cases, the system seems to be only partially applying the rules when transforming the grid.\n*   **Zero-Filled Grids:**  The system frequently defaults to outputting a grid filled with zeros. This occurs because the test input is often the incorrect 3x3 grid, and because the rule implementation is flawed.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Logic:** The system claims to understand the transformation rule, yet the application of this rule is consistently incorrect. The logic for transforming input to output grid is faulty.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has very limited capabilities. While it demonstrates some ability to extract information and infer dimensions, its core function of applying transformation rules to generate accurate output grids is fundamentally broken.  The accuracy of 0.00 reflects this. The system can extract information, but fails in solving the problem.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system can extract the training examples, input grid and output grid.\n*   **Dimension Inference:**  The dimension inference appears to be functioning relatively reliably.\n*   **Rule Localization:** The system attempts to localize the transformation rule.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Rule Application:**  The single biggest issue. It's not applying the rules correctly to the input.\n*   **Inaccurate Input for Transformation:** The system is passing an incorrect input to the transformation stage.\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Generalization:**  Poor pattern recognition and generalization skills. It doesn't learn the rules.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Demonstrates a lack of spatial reasoning skills.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Rule Application.**  Correcting the data pipeline so that the right data is fed to the application of the rule and then correcting the logic within the rule application algorithm.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Fix the Data Pipeline:** The highest priority is to ensure the correct test input grid is used in the 'Transformed Grid' section. Implement debugging \"print\" statements to show the state of the Test Input Grid at each step. Focus on ensuring the system is receiving the intended data from the initial extraction through transformation.\n2.  **Revise Rule Application Logic:** Debug the rule application logic to ensure it accurately translates the localized rule into grid transformations. Start with simplified rules and gradually increase complexity.\n3.  **Implement Spatial Reasoning:** Explore spatial reasoning techniques by implementing algorithms that can analyze the spatial relationships between elements in the grid, such as convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks.\n4.  **Add Print Statements:** Add print statements throughout the system to expose internal data structures and decision-making processes, especially during rule application. This will aid in debugging and understanding where the process is failing.\n5.  **Test Input Data:** When a \"rule\" is \"localized\", test that rule against the provided training data to see if that rule works to convert the given Input Grid to the Output Grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the 0% accuracy and the significant issues identified in the execution analysis, the capability trend is currently **declining**. Urgent action is required to address the core issues preventing the system from functioning correctly. Focusing on fixing the data pipeline, improving rule application, and adding debugging aids are critical steps for reversing this trend.\n",

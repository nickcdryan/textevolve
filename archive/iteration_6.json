  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by extracting details, finding a time, and verifying constraints using LLMs. The problem is decomposed into extraction, suggestion, and verification stages, each handled by a dedicated LLM call with specific system instructions. `extract_meeting_details` extracts structured meeting information, `find_meeting_time` suggests a meeting time, and `verify_meeting_time` validates the suggestion against the original question. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow, calling `extract_meeting_details`, `find_meeting_time`, and `verify_meeting_time` sequentially to schedule the meeting or report errors. The `call_llm` function is used by all of the other functions and facilitates the interaction with the LLM.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs you provided.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample 1:** The system correctly identifies the earliest available time when all participants are generally available all day.  However, the approach is overly verbose and inefficient. It iterates through time slots instead of directly checking for overlapping availability.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system appears to correctly handle different availabilities and select an appropriate meeting time considering Amy's preference to avoid Mondays. The reasoning is sound, and the constraints are addressed.\n*   **Sample 3:** This is where the core problem appears. The system attempts to intersect availabilities of 5 participants, but makes a mistake. It incorrectly states Jose is unavailable at 9:30. Helen is available from 9:30 onward (this is correct), then concludes the next time to examine is 10:00 (incorrect, should examine 9:30). It also incorrectly states there's an intersection of availability between 12:30-13:00, which would allow a meeting at 12:30. Later says there is an intersection at 15:00, but the final answer is still 12:30. The analysis and final answer are incorrect.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates an understanding of scheduling constraints and preferences, but struggles with accurately determining overlapping availability, especially when dealing with multiple participants with complex schedules. The \"high-level\" reasoning is often correct, but the detailed execution of schedule intersection is flawed.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **High-Level Reasoning about Constraints:** The system generally understands the need to consider participant availability and preferences.\n*   **Verbose Explanation:** The system attempts to explain its reasoning process, which can be helpful for debugging (even if the reasoning itself is flawed).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Intersection:** The system consistently fails to accurately calculate the overlapping availability of multiple participants. This is the *core* problem.\n*   **Lack of Structured Approach:** The system uses an inefficient, iterative approach to finding available times instead of a more direct intersection method.\n*   **Inefficient Reasoning:** The system is very verbose, reasoning through time windows when this is not necessary.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate availability intersection**. Without this, the system is fundamentally unable to solve the scheduling problem.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Structured Data Representation and Algorithmic Time Slot Comparison:**\n    *   **Action:** Modify the system to first convert the free-text schedules into a structured format, such as a list of blocked time intervals for each participant. Use an LLM call or Python code. Example:\n\n    ```python\n    # Example Output of schedule_parser\n    {\n      \"Mason\": [{\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"17:00\"}],\n      \"Evelyn\": [{\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"17:00\"}],\n      \"Jose\": [{\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"9:30\"}, {\"start\": \"10:00\", \"end\": \"11:30\"}, {\"start\": \"12:00\", \"end\": \"15:30\"}],\n      \"Helen\": [{\"start\": \"9:30\", \"end\": \"11:00\"}, {\"start\": \"12:00\", \"end\": \"13:00\"}, {\"start\": \"14:30\", \"end\": \"15:30\"}, {\"start\": \"16:00\", \"end\": \"16:30\"}],\n      \"Beverly\": [{\"start\": \"12:30\", \"end\": \"13:00\"}, {\"start\": \"15:00\", \"end\": \"16:30\"}]\n    }\n\n    ```\n\n    *   **Action:** Implement Python code to explicitly calculate the intersection of these time intervals.  This should be a deterministic, algorithmic process *after* the parsing step. Aim for a fast and efficient implementation.\n    *   **Rationale:** This addresses the \"Availability Intersection Accuracy\" bottleneck by providing a reliable, code-based mechanism for determining overlapping availability.\n2.  **Introduce a Verification Agent:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement a \"Verification Agent\" that takes the proposed solution (meeting time) and the original schedules as input. This agent should *independently* verify that *all* participants are available during the suggested time and that it is indeed the earliest possible time.\n    *   **Action:** If the Verification Agent finds an error, it should provide specific feedback to the main system. The main system should then attempt to correct the solution, or if it can't, return 'Unable to determine a meeting time'\n    *   **Rationale:** This addresses the \"Solution Verification\" improvement area by providing an independent check on the system's output.  The agent can also check the schedule against a given time, as well as verify that a given time is the earliest available.\n\n3.  **Re-Architect to Leverage LLM Strengths:**\n    *   **Action:** Use the LLM primarily for understanding, parsing, and reasoning about constraints and preferences.

    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system based on the performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs you provided.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample 1:** The system correctly identifies the earliest available time when all participants are generally available all day.  However, the approach is overly verbose and inefficient. It iterates through time slots instead of directly checking for overlapping availability.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system appears to correctly handle different availabilities and select an appropriate meeting time considering Amy's preference to avoid Mondays. The reasoning is sound, and the constraints are addressed.\n*   **Sample 3:** This is where the core problem appears. The system attempts to intersect availabilities of 5 participants, but makes a mistake. It incorrectly states Jose is unavailable at 9:30. Helen is available from 9:30 onward (this is correct), then concludes the next time to examine is 10:00 (incorrect, should examine 9:30). It also incorrectly states there's an intersection of availability between 12:30-13:00, which would allow a meeting at 12:30. Later says there is an intersection at 15:00, but the final answer is still 12:30. The analysis and final answer are incorrect.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates an understanding of scheduling constraints and preferences, but struggles with accurately determining overlapping availability, especially when dealing with multiple participants with complex schedules. The \"high-level\" reasoning is often correct, but the detailed execution of schedule intersection is flawed.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **High-Level Reasoning about Constraints:** The system generally understands the need to consider participant availability and preferences.\n*   **Verbose Explanation:** The system attempts to explain its reasoning process, which can be helpful for debugging (even if the reasoning itself is flawed).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Intersection:** The system consistently fails to accurately calculate the overlapping availability of multiple participants. This is the *core* problem.\n*   **Lack of Structured Approach:** The system uses an inefficient, iterative approach to finding available times instead of a more direct intersection method.\n*   **Inefficient Reasoning:** The system is very verbose, reasoning through time windows when this is not necessary.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate availability intersection**. Without this, the system is fundamentally unable to solve the scheduling problem.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Structured Data Representation and Algorithmic Time Slot Comparison:**\n    *   **Action:** Modify the system to first convert the free-text schedules into a structured format, such as a list of blocked time intervals for each participant. Use an LLM call or Python code. Example:\n\n    ```python\n    # Example Output of schedule_parser\n    {\n      \"Mason\": [{\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"17:00\"}],\n      \"Evelyn\": [{\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"17:00\"}],\n      \"Jose\": [{\"start\": \"9:00\", \"end\": \"9:30\"}, {\"start\": \"10:00\", \"end\": \"11:30\"}, {\"start\": \"12:00\", \"end\": \"15:30\"}],\n      \"Helen\": [{\"start\": \"9:30\", \"end\": \"11:00\"}, {\"start\": \"12:00\", \"end\": \"13:00\"}, {\"start\": \"14:30\", \"end\": \"15:30\"}, {\"start\": \"16:00\", \"end\": \"16:30\"}],\n      \"Beverly\": [{\"start\": \"12:30\", \"end\": \"13:00\"}, {\"start\": \"15:00\", \"end\": \"16:30\"}]\n    }\n\n    ```\n\n    *   **Action:** Implement Python code to explicitly calculate the intersection of these time intervals.  This should be a deterministic, algorithmic process *after* the parsing step. Aim for a fast and efficient implementation.\n    *   **Rationale:** This addresses the \"Availability Intersection Accuracy\" bottleneck by providing a reliable, code-based mechanism for determining overlapping availability.\n2.  **Introduce a Verification Agent:**\n    *   **Action:** Implement a \"Verification Agent\" that takes the proposed solution (meeting time) and the original schedules as input. This agent should *independently* verify that *all* participants are available during the suggested time and that it is indeed the earliest possible time.\n    *   **Action:** If the Verification Agent finds an error, it should provide specific feedback to the main system. The main system should then attempt to correct the solution, or if it can't, return 'Unable to determine a meeting time'\n    *   **Rationale:** This addresses the \"Solution Verification\" improvement area by providing an independent check on the system's output.  The agent can also check the schedule against a given time, as well as verify that a given time is the earliest available.\n\n3.  **Re-Architect to Leverage LLM Strengths:**\n    *   **Action:** Use the LLM primarily for understanding, parsing, and reasoning about constraints and preferences.  Offload the actual *calculation* of availability intersection to deterministic Python code. Use the LLM to convert schedule to structured data, and back to natural language.\n    *   **Rationale:** This leverages the LLM's strengths while mitigating its weaknesses in precise numerical calculation.\n\n4.  **Reduce Verbosity and Iterative Reasoning:**\n    *   **Action:** Remove the iterative reasoning sections where the system steps through each time slot. Once it has the intersection, use natural language to explain *why* this is the earliest time.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will increase efficiency, as well as avoid potential mistakes in reasoning through individual time slots.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the capabilities are currently **stable but inadequate** due to the core issue of inaccurate availability intersection. The system is not reliably solving the problem. Addressing this core issue is critical for any improvement. If this issue is not improved, then the capabilities are **declining**, as there is evidence that the system is not performing at an acceptable level.\n"

  "approach_summary": "This script uses a decomposition approach to answer questions based on a given passage by determining the question type, extracting relevant information, and generating the final answer, leveraging LLMs at each step. It employs example-based prompting to guide the LLM. Three distinct agent roles are used, each corresponding to a dedicated function: question type classifier, information extractor, and answer generator. The functions used are `main`, `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, `generate_answer`, and `call_llm`; the `main` function orchestrates the process by calling the question type, information extraction, and answer generation functions sequentially, and these functions use `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model.",

The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The opening day of the offensive  was the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead.

According to a 1900 British report compiled by Alfred Biliotti, who is considered to have heavily relied on Greek intelligence agents, starting from 1897, the members of the Exarchist committees had embarked upon a systematic and extensive campaign of executions of the leading members of the Greek side. Moreover, Bulgarian Komitadjis, pursued a campaign of extermination of Greek and Serbian teachers and clergy. On the other hand, there were attacks by Greek Andartes on many Macedonian Bulgarian villages, with the aim of forcing their inhabitants to switch their allegiance from the Exarchate back to the Patriarchate and accept Greek priest and teachers, but they also carried out massacres against the civilian population, especially in the central parts of Macedonia in 1905 and in 1906. One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani , which was an aggressive pro-Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands. According to British reports on political crimes , during the period from 1897 to 1912 over 4000 political murders were committed , excluding those killed during the Ilinden uprising and the members of the Bulgarian and Greek bands. Of those who were killed, 53% were Bulgarians, 33.5% were Greeks, Serbs and Aromanians together 3.5% and 10% were of an unknown nationality.

The Germans made initial gains, before French counter-attacks returned matters to near their starting point. Casualties were greater for the French, but the Germans bled heavily as well, with anywhere from 700,000 to 975,000 casualties suffered between the two combatants. Verdun became a symbol of French determination and self-sacrifice. The Battle of the Somme was an Anglo-French offensive of July to November 1916. The opening day of the offensive  was the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army some 420,000 casualties. The French suffered another estimated 200,000 casualties and the Germans an estimated 500,000. Gun fire wasn't the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. The living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as trench foot, shell shock, blindness/burns from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, cooties  and the \u2018Spanish Flu'.",

According to a 1900 British report compiled by Alfred Biliotti, who is considered to have heavily relied on Greek intelligence agents, starting from 1897, the members of the Exarchist committees had embarked upon a systematic and extensive campaign of executions of the leading members of the Greek side. Moreover, Bulgarian Komitadjis, pursued a campaign of extermination of Greek and Serbian teachers and clergy. On the other hand, there were attacks by Greek Andartes on many Macedonian Bulgarian villages, with the aim of forcing their inhabitants to switch their allegiance from the Exarchate back to the Patriarchate and accept Greek priest and teachers, but they also carried out massacres against the civilian population, especially in the central parts of Macedonia in 1905 and in 1906. One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani , which was an aggressive pro-Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands. According to British reports on political crimes , during the period from 1897 to 1912 over 4000 political murders were committed , excluding those killed during the Ilinden uprising and the members of the Bulgarian and Greek bands.

      "text_report": "Okay, here is a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your requirements.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nBased on the sample execution outputs and the error analysis report, the following observations can be made:\n\n*   **Arithmetic Errors:** The model demonstrates basic arithmetic but struggles with more complex calculations or those involving negative numbers. For example, in the first execution output, the result `21 - 7 = 14 points` is correctly extracted, but the context might be lost. The second output demonstrates the ability to calculate simple differences.\n*   **Incorrect Date Handling:** The third execution output showcases issues with calculating durations involving months. The model correctly interprets February as the starting month, but the duration to December is inaccurate.\n*   **Contextual Understanding and Unit Misinterpretation:** There's a lack of contextual understanding. The model struggles to understand the underlying context in the question to calculate the correct value, especially with unit interpretation.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates basic information extraction and simple calculation abilities. However, its performance is significantly hampered by weaknesses in numerical reasoning, contextual understanding (especially with units), and the ability to identify minimum/maximum values from textual data. This leads to frequent errors in generating correct answers. The accuracy score of 0.50 (5/10) reflects this mixed performance.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Direct Information Retrieval:** The system can successfully identify and extract explicit information when directly stated in the passage.\n*   **Basic Arithmetic:** The system can perform simple arithmetic calculations when the question is straightforward.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Numerical Reasoning:** The system makes errors in arithmetic calculations, particularly with date differences, negative values, and finding differences.\n*   **Contextual Misinterpretation:** The system struggles to understand the context of the question, especially regarding units and constraints (e.g., finding the *shortest* instead of *any*).\n*   **Lack of Constraint Satisfaction:** The system doesn't properly enforce constraints described in the passage to come up with an appropriate answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Numerical Reasoning and Contextual Understanding**, with a specific emphasis on unit handling, constraint satisfaction, and accurate arithmetic. These are intertwined \u2013 understanding the context often dictates the numerical operations to perform and the units to use.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Numerical Reasoning Module (NRM):**\n    *   **Details:** This module should be responsible for:\n        *   **Numerical Extraction:** Identifying all numbers and relevant units within the input text.\n        *   **Constraint Identification:** Recognizing constraints (e.g., \"shortest,\" \"longest,\" \"before,\" \"after\") implied in the question.\n        *   **Arithmetic Operation Planning:** Determining the necessary arithmetic operations to perform based on the question and identified constraints (e.g., subtraction for finding differences, comparison for finding minimum/maximum).\n        *   **Calculation Execution:** Performing the planned arithmetic operations accurately.\n        *   **Unit Handling:** Tracking units through calculations and providing the final answer with the correct units.\n    *   **Implementation:** Start by implementing this module as a separate function that can be called by the main AI system.\n\n2.  **Enhance Training Data with Targeted Examples:**\n    *   **Details:** Create new training examples that specifically target the identified weaknesses:\n        *   **Date Calculation Examples:** Include numerous examples involving date differences with varying units (days, weeks, months, years).\n        *   **Negative Value Examples:** Include scenarios that involve the use of negative numbers, such as losses or deficits.\n        *   **Minimum/Maximum Examples:** Include examples where the system must identify the shortest, longest, smallest, or largest value from a set of numbers.\n        *   **Complex Context Examples:** Develop examples that have multiple steps in the question to increase the complexity of questions which require the model to follow context.\n    *   **Implementation:** Prioritize generating 20-30 high-quality examples for each weakness.\n\n3.  **Implement a Rule-Based Unit Checker:**\n    *   **Details:** Create a rule-based system that validates the units used in the answer:\n        *   **Unit Identification:** Recognize common units (e.g., meters, years, points).\n        *   **Unit Matching:** Ensure the units in the answer match the units implied by the question.  For example, if the question asks for a time difference, the answer should be in time units (seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc.).\n        *   **Error Handling:** If the units are incorrect, flag the answer as potentially wrong and trigger the NRM to re-evaluate the calculation.\n    *   **Implementation:** Start with a simple set of rules for common units and gradually expand the rule set as needed.\n\n4.  **Improve Date Handling Logic:**\n    *   **Details:** Enhance the date parsing and calculation mechanism to accurately determine date differences. This could involve using a dedicated date/time library and implementing error handling for ambiguous date formats.\n    *   **Implementation:** Integrate a date/time library (like Python's `datetime` module) and thoroughly test it with different date formats.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, it is difficult to assess a clear capability trend. The system shows strengths in basic areas but significant weaknesses in more complex reasoning tasks. Without targeted improvements, the capabilities are likely to remain **stable** at a low level. If the actionable recommendations are implemented, the capability trend would hopefully move toward **improving**.\n",

The second output demonstrates the ability to calculate simple differences.\n*   **Incorrect Date Handling:** The third execution output showcases issues with calculating durations involving months. The model correctly interprets February as the starting month, but the duration to December is inaccurate.\n*   **Contextual Understanding and Unit Misinterpretation:** There's a lack of contextual understanding. The model struggles to understand the underlying context in the question to calculate the correct value, especially with unit interpretation.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates basic information extraction and simple calculation abilities. However, its performance is significantly hampered by weaknesses in numerical reasoning, contextual understanding (especially with units), and the ability to identify minimum/maximum values from textual data. This leads to frequent errors in generating correct answers. The accuracy score of 0.50 (5/10) reflects this mixed performance.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Direct Information Retrieval:** The system can successfully identify and extract explicit information when directly stated in the passage.\n*   **Basic Arithmetic:** The system can perform simple arithmetic calculations when the question is straightforward.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Numerical Reasoning:** The system makes errors in arithmetic calculations, particularly with date differences, negative values, and finding differences.\n*   **Contextual Misinterpretation:** The system struggles to understand the context of the question, especially regarding units and constraints (e.g., finding the *shortest* instead of *any*).\n*   **Lack of Constraint Satisfaction:** The system doesn't properly enforce constraints described in the passage to come up with an appropriate answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Numerical Reasoning and Contextual Understanding**, with a specific emphasis on unit handling, constraint satisfaction, and accurate arithmetic. These are intertwined \u2013 understanding the context often dictates the numerical operations to perform and the units to use.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Numerical Reasoning Module (NRM):**\n    *   **Details:** This module should be responsible for:\n        *   **Numerical Extraction:** Identifying all numbers and relevant units within the input text.\n        *   **Constraint Identification:** Recognizing constraints (e.g., \"shortest,\" \"longest,\" \"before,\" \"after\") implied in the question.\n        *   **Arithmetic Operation Planning:** Determining the necessary arithmetic operations to perform based on the question and identified constraints (e.g., subtraction for finding differences, comparison for finding minimum/maximum).\n        *   **Calculation Execution:** Performing the planned arithmetic operations accurately.\n        *   **Unit Handling:** Tracking units through calculations and providing the final answer with the correct units.\n    *   **Implementation:** Start by implementing this module as a separate function that can be called by the main AI system.\n\n2.  **Enhance Training Data with Targeted Examples:**\n    *   **Details:** Create new training examples that specifically target the identified weaknesses:\n        *   **Date Calculation Examples:** Include numerous examples involving date differences with varying units (days, weeks, months, years).\n        *   **Negative Value Examples:** Include scenarios that involve the use of negative numbers, such as losses or deficits.\n        *   **Minimum/Maximum Examples:** Include examples where the system must identify the shortest, longest, smallest, or largest value from a set of numbers.\n        *   **Complex Context Examples:** Develop examples that have multiple steps in the question to increase the complexity of questions which require the model to follow context.\n    *   **Implementation:** Prioritize generating 20-30 high-quality examples for each weakness.\n\n3.  **Implement a Rule-Based Unit Checker:**\n    *   **Details:** Create a rule-based system that validates the units used in the answer:\n        *   **Unit Identification:** Recognize common units (e.g., meters, years, points).\n        *   **Unit Matching:** Ensure the units in the answer match the units implied by the question.  For example, if the question asks for a time difference, the answer should be in time units (seconds, minutes, hours, days, etc.).\n        *   **Error Handling:** If the units are incorrect, flag the answer as potentially wrong and trigger the NRM to re-evaluate the calculation.\n    *   **Implementation:** Start with a simple set of rules for common units and gradually expand the rule set as needed.\n\n4.  **Improve Date Handling Logic:**\n    *   **Details:** Enhance the date parsing and calculation mechanism to accurately determine date differences. This could involve using a dedicated date/time library and implementing error handling for ambiguous date formats.\n    *   **Implementation:** Integrate a date/time library (like Python's `datetime` module) and thoroughly test it with different date formats.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, it is difficult to assess a clear capability trend. The system shows strengths in basic areas but significant weaknesses in more complex reasoning tasks. Without targeted improvements, the capabilities are likely to remain **stable** at a low level. If the actionable recommendations are implemented, the capability trend would hopefully move toward **improving**.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions by analyzing the question, extracting relevant information, generating an initial answer, and then verifying it. The problem is decomposed into four main steps: question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification, each leveraging a specific LLM agent role. The functions used are `main`, `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, `verify_answer`, and `call_llm`. The workflow begins with `main` calling `analyze_question`, then `extract_relevant_passage` using the output of `analyze_question`, followed by `generate_answer` utilizing the outputs of the previous two functions, and finally `verify_answer` leveraging the outputs of `generate_answer` and `extract_relevant_passage` before returning the verified answer.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: This Week 12 showdown between the Colts and Eagles was originally scheduled for 1:00 ET, but due to the NFL's \"flexible-scheduling\" system this year, the NFL moved the game to Sunday night at 8:15 ET. This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game. During this game, the Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea, TE Dallas Clark and OT Ryan Diem all to injuries in the first half, and they did not return.\n\nQUESTION: How many touchdowns did Joseph Addai score in the first half?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Following a shocking loss to the 3-7 Kansas City Chiefs the previous week, the Steelers traveled to M&T Bank Stadium for another divisional game. Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game.

This was the Colts' third primetime game this year on NBC, and the Eagles' first. There were 10 scores in this game, 5 each half. The first three scores of the game were by Colts rookie RB Joseph Addai. He had a 15-yard TD run, a 10-yard TD run, and another 15-yard TD run after that. His fourth rushing touchdown of the game came in the second half. The Eagles' first score came with about a minute to go in the half. Quarterback Jeff Garcia threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to L.J. Smith on that drive. On the Colts' next drive, combined with a couple passes and a 13-yard run by Dominic Rhodes, the Colts put K Adam Vinatieri in field goal range to get some more points before the end of the half. At the half, the Colts had a 17-point lead, 24-7. After a Reggie Wayne touchdown catch, the Colts were up big on the Eagles, 31-7. On the ensuing possession for the Eagles, Garcia found Reggie Brown in the end zone for a  3-yard score. But with less than 11 minutes left in the game, the Eagles scored once more and reduced the Colts' lead to 10 points. On the following possession, the Colts ran the ball 13 times with no passes and Joseph Addai had the last 8 carries on that drive including another 4-yard scamper, his fourth touchdown of the game. That touchdown also tied the Colts franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns in a single game. With less than four minutes to go in the game, the Eagles were desperate to score some points, but while Jeff Garcia was deep in his own territory, he dropped back to pass and was hit by both DE Robert Mathis and DE Dwight Freeney. Mathis knocked the ball out of Garcia's hand right before his arm started going forwards and CB Kelvin Hayden picked up the ball and ran it back for a touchdown. The Colts were up by 24 points after that last score. On the next possession, the Eagles put in backup QB A. J. Feeley in place of Garcia, and Feeley ended up getting the football knocked out of his hand by Robert Mathis (his second forced fumble of the game) and the Colts recovered and ended up running out the clock to conclude the game. Joseph Addai tied the NFL record for most touchdowns in a game by a rookie, with 4 touchdowns in this game. During this game, the Colts lost SS Antoine Bethea, TE Dallas Clark and OT Ryan Diem all to injuries in the first half, and they did not return.",

Ben Roethlisberger, who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss, was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup Charlie Batch also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB Dennis Dixon, who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR Santonio Holmes on a play-action pass for a 33-yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9-yard reception but fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by Lawrence Timmons and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24-yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17&#160;yards, and then found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10&#160;yard line with less than 2&#160;minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24-yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. The Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40&#160;yard line, where their drive stalled. With the clock counting inside 10&#160;seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56&#160;yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2&#160;yards short, sending the game into overtime. In overtime, the Steelers won the coin toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40&#160;yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon threw an interception to LB Paul Kruger, who returned the ball 26&#160;yards to the Steeler 28&#160;yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11&#160;yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal to win the game.

Bourbon and d'Avalos, their troops not yet recovered from the campaign in Provence, were in no position to offer serious resistance. The French army moved in several columns, brushing aside Imperial attempts to hold its advance, but failed to bring the main body of Imperial troops to battle. Nevertheless, Charles de Lannoy, who had concentrated some 16,000 men to resist the 33,000 French troops closing on Milan, decided that the city could not be defended and withdrew to Lodi on 26 October.

In Franconia, the margraves of Ansbach and Bayreuth as well as the imperial cities were part of this alliance. The Catholic side responded in 1609 with a counter-alliance, the League. The conflicts between the two camps ultimately resulted in the Thirty Years' War, which was the greatest strain on the cohesion of the Franconian Circle Initially, Franconia was not a theatre of war, although marauding armies repeatedly crossed its territory. However, in 1631, Swedish troops under Gustavus Adolphus advanced into Franconia and established a large encampment in summer 1632 around Nuremberg. However, the Swedes lost the Battle of the Alte Veste against Wallenstein's troops and eventually withdrew. Franconia was one of the poorest regions in the Empire and lost its imperial political significance. During the course of the war, about half the local population lost their lives. To compensate for these losses about 150,000\u00a0displaced Protestants settled in Protestant areas, including Austrian exiles.",

This is apparent in the success cases where simple extraction is sufficient.\n2.  **Explicit Text Comprehension**: The model accurately extracts specific named entities and concepts from the passages.\n3.  **Logic Execution**: The model is able to perform logic execution, correctly calculating values and determining the correctness.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Implicit Calculation Failure:** The system struggles when the answer requires implicit numerical calculation or deduction, even with relatively simple arithmetic (e.g., sample IDs 2, 4). The model does not seem to be able to identify that the values are available and an operation needs to occur.\n2.  **Contextual Understanding of Game Scores:** The system does not understand what the implications of game scores are or how to infer data from them.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Lack of Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system lacks a reliable module for performing basic arithmetic operations on extracted numerical information. This limits its ability to answer questions requiring calculation.\n2.  **Failure to Understand Game Contexts:** A lack of general context causes the model to fail to answer simple questions on game scores.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Calculation Neglect:** The most prominent pattern is the system's failure to perform or even recognize the need for basic addition, subtraction, or other calculations required to derive the answer. This happens even when all necessary information is directly present in the passage.\n2.  **Literal Interpretation**: The model tends to interpret text literally and struggles with implicit information or inferences, requiring explicit statements in the passage.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **absence of a functional arithmetic reasoning component** that can identify and execute basic calculations based on extracted numerical information. This prevents the system from answering questions that go beyond simple information retrieval.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Arithmetic Reasoning:** Implement a dedicated module or function for performing arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on extracted numerical values. This module should be able to identify when such calculations are needed based on the question and the extracted information.\n2.  **Context Incorporation**: Allow the model to understand more general contexts so that it is not just retrieving text.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Develop an Arithmetic Module:** Create a Python module specifically designed to handle arithmetic reasoning. This module should:\n    *   Accept a question and a list of extracted numerical values as input.\n    *   Analyze the question for keywords indicating arithmetic operations (e.g., \"total,\" \"more than,\" \"difference\").\n    *   Perform the appropriate calculation based on the question and extracted values.\n    *   Return the calculated result.\n2.  **Integrate Arithmetic Module:** Integrate the arithmetic module into the main reasoning pipeline. Before generating the final answer, check if the question requires arithmetic reasoning. If so, pass the relevant extracted values to the arithmetic module and use the returned result as the answer.\n3.  **Context Incorporation**: Include general facts about the world so that the model can incorporate context.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n",

The model excels at finding direct answers within the text but fails when even basic calculations are needed.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Direct Information Extraction:**  The system effectively extracts information explicitly stated in the text.\n*   **Explicit Text Comprehension**: The model accurately extracts specific named entities and concepts from the passages.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Arithmetic Reasoning:**  The system is unable to perform basic arithmetic operations on extracted numerical data.\n*   **Inference and Implication:**  The system struggles to draw inferences or understand the implications of information.\n*   **Context Understanding:** The system lacks a solid understanding of general facts that would cause the system to fail to answer simple questions on game scores.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Arithmetic Reasoning**.  This directly addresses the primary issue and unlocks a much broader range of solvable problems.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement an Arithmetic Reasoning Module:**  Develop and integrate a dedicated module for performing arithmetic calculations, as detailed in the original Improvement Suggestions. This module should:\n    *   Accept a question and a list of extracted numerical values as input.\n    *   Analyze the question for keywords indicating arithmetic operations (e.g., \"total,\" \"more than,\" \"difference,\" \"final score\").\n    *   Perform the appropriate calculation based on the question and extracted values.\n    *   Return the calculated result.\n2.  **Context Incorporation**: Include general facts about the world so that the model can incorporate context.\n3.  **Introduce \"Calculation Required\" Flag:**  Within the core logic, add a flag that is set when the question *requires* arithmetic.  This avoids unnecessary calls to the arithmetic module for questions that can be answered by simple retrieval.\n4.  **Fine-tune on Arithmetic Datasets:**  Train the AI model on a dataset specifically designed to improve arithmetic reasoning skills. This dataset should include questions that require addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For game scores, fine-tune on datasets with game scores.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the error analysis, the capabilities appear **stable**.  The system consistently performs well on direct extraction tasks but consistently fails on tasks requiring reasoning.  Implementing the actionable recommendations should lead to a positive upward trend.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo runtime errors were explicitly identified in the provided `output` fields.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Numerical Matching:** The system demonstrates a strong ability to correctly extract and match numerical values when present directly in the text (e.g., sample IDs 0, 6, 7). This is apparent in the success cases where simple extraction is sufficient.\n2.  **Explicit Text Comprehension**: The model accurately extracts specific named entities and concepts from the passages.\n3.  **Logic Execution**: The model is able to perform logic execution, correctly calculating values and determining the correctness.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Implicit Calculation Failure:** The system struggles when the answer requires implicit numerical calculation or deduction, even with relatively simple arithmetic (e.g., sample IDs 2, 4). The model does not seem to be able to identify that the values are available and an operation needs to occur.\n2.  **Contextual Understanding of Game Scores:** The system does not understand what the implications of game scores are or how to infer data from them.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Lack of Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system lacks a reliable module for performing basic arithmetic operations on extracted numerical information. This limits its ability to answer questions requiring calculation.\n2.  **Failure to Understand Game Contexts:** A lack of general context causes the model to fail to answer simple questions on game scores.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Calculation Neglect:** The most prominent pattern is the system's failure to perform or even recognize the need for basic addition, subtraction, or other calculations required to derive the answer. This happens even when all necessary information is directly present in the passage.\n2.  **Literal Interpretation**: The model tends to interpret text literally and struggles with implicit information or inferences, requiring explicit statements in the passage.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **absence of a functional arithmetic reasoning component** that can identify and execute basic calculations based on extracted numerical information. This prevents the system from answering questions that go beyond simple information retrieval.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Arithmetic Reasoning:** Implement a dedicated module or function for performing arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on extracted numerical values. This module should be able to identify when such calculations are needed based on the question and the extracted information.\n2.  **Context Incorporation**: Allow the model to understand more general contexts so that it is not just retrieving text.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Develop an Arithmetic Module:** Create a Python module specifically designed to handle arithmetic reasoning. This module should:\n    *   Accept a question and a list of extracted numerical values as input.\n    *   Analyze the question for keywords indicating arithmetic operations (e.g., \"total,\" \"more than,\" \"difference\").\n    *   Perform the appropriate calculation based on the question and extracted values.\n    *   Return the calculated result.\n2.  **Integrate Arithmetic Module:** Integrate the arithmetic module into the main reasoning pipeline. Before generating the final answer, check if the question requires arithmetic reasoning. If so, pass the relevant extracted values to the arithmetic module and use the returned result as the answer.\n3.  **Context Incorporation**: Include general facts about the world so that the model can incorporate context.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n",

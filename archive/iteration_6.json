  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to extract participants and constraints from a meeting request and then to solve the scheduling problem given those extracted components. The `extract_participants` and `extract_constraints_with_example` functions extract information using the LLM with a system instruction, while `solve_meeting_problem` determines the meeting time based on the extracted data using another LLM call. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling the extraction functions and then the problem-solving function, while `call_llm` handles the interface with the Gemini API. The script implements a chain-of-thought approach by breaking down the problem into information extraction and solution generation.",

      "text_report": "## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided execution outputs reveal several issues, confirming the error analysis.\n\n*   **Sample 1:** The system incorrectly identifies 9:30-10:00 as a time slot where everyone is available. Hannah is busy from 9:00-9:30, meaning 9:30-10:00 isn't fully free. Randy is busy 10:00-11:30, which isn't reflected correctly in his available slots. Rebecca is busy 10:00-10:30, also not reflected accurately. The listing of free slots isn't derived accurately from busy slots.\n*   **Sample 2:** Deborah's busy slots lead to inaccurate calculation of available slots. It lists Deborah's available time as 10:00 - 13:00 which is incorrect considering Deborah's busy slots are 9:00-10:00, 13:00-13:30, 15:00-16:00, 16:30-17:00.\n*   **Sample 3:** On Wednesday analysis, it marks 9:00-9:30 as available for both, despite the prompt stating Catherine is busy from 9:30-12:30.\n\nThese errors confirm a fundamental flaw in calculating available time slots based on provided busy slots. The system's logic for negating busy times and determining free times is faulty. It shows an incomplete or incorrect filtering of busy times and the subsequent calculation of available/free slots is inaccurate. The system also doesn't appear to consistently apply all constraints (e.g., the preference to not meet on Tuesday in Sample 3, the preference to not meet after 12:00 in Sample 2).\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of the scheduling problem and can identify participants and constraints. However, its core capability \u2013 determining available time slots based on busy schedules and constraints \u2013 is significantly flawed, leading to inaccurate solutions. The system also lacks advanced features like preference handling and solution optimization.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Structured Approach:** The system's organized approach to identifying participants, constraints, and attempting to find overlapping free slots provides a solid foundation.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The system correctly extracts and lists constraints, showcasing a good understanding of the input format.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Free Time Calculation:** The most critical weakness is the flawed logic for calculating available time slots from busy schedules, resulting in frequent errors.\n*   **Inconsistent Constraint Application:** Constraints and preferences are not consistently applied, leading to suboptimal and incorrect solutions.\n*   **Lack of Solution Verification:** The system does not verify whether a proposed solution actually satisfies all constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most critical area for improvement is **accurate free time calculation**. Addressing this flaw will significantly improve the system's overall accuracy and reliability.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Free Time Calculation Module:** Replace the current logic with a robust module specifically designed for parsing schedules and calculating accurate free time slots.\n    *   Use a dedicated function: `calculate_free_slots(schedule, constraints)`\n    *   The function should take the schedule and constraints as input and return an ordered list of free time slots.\n    *   Utilize deterministic code to perform accurate datetime arithmetic and comparisons.\n\n2.  **Incorporate a Solution Verification Step:** Add a verification step to ensure that the proposed time slot satisfies all constraints for every participant.\n    *   Create a `verify_solution(solution, schedules, constraints)` function.\n    *   This function checks if the `solution` time slot is valid for everyone, given their `schedules` and `constraints`.\n\n3.  **Prioritize Accurate Schedule Extraction:** Improve the `information_extraction` process to precisely identify and extract busy schedules.\n    *   Employ few-shot examples demonstrating precise schedule parsing to guide the LLM.\n    *   Add an explicit verification step to check if schedules are parsed correctly before proceeding.\n\n4. **Few-Shot Learning Refinement:**\n    - **Increase the Number of Few-Shot Examples:** Add examples to the prompt to provide more guidance on free time slot calculation and constraint application.\n    - **Include Edge Cases:** Add examples where the best solution requires more complex reasoning, such as when there are no perfectly overlapping time slots.\n    - **Refine Example Wording:** Improve the wording of the examples to make the reasoning steps clearer and more explicit.\n\n5. **Use a Step-by-Step Reasoning Approach:**\n    - **Explicitly Outline Reasoning:** Instruct the LLM to explicitly state its reasoning for each step of the process, including how it calculates free time slots and applies constraints.\n    - **Use Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Implement chain-of-thought prompting to encourage the LLM to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.\n    - **Refine Prompts for Clarity:** Ensure that the prompts are clear, concise, and easy to understand, leaving no room for ambiguity.\n\n6. **Implement Time-Based Comparison using Datetime Objects:**\n    - **Calculate Free Time Slots:** Accurately determine available time slots for each participant based on their busy schedules.\n    - **Convert Time Strings to Datetime Objects:** Convert time strings (e.g., \"9:00\", \"17:00\") to datetime objects for easier comparison.\n    - **Calculate Overlapping Time Slots:** Determine overlapping time slots by iterating over each participant's free time slots and finding common intervals.\n    - **Consider Minimum Meeting Duration:** Ensure that the overlapping time slots meet the minimum meeting duration requirement (e.g., 30 minutes).\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the system's capabilities are currently **stable but inaccurate**. While the system exhibits a structured approach, the core functionality of free time calculation is flawed, leading to consistent errors. Implementing the actionable recommendations above should shift the trend towards improvement.\n",

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by iteratively refining candidate schedules using multiple LLM-based agents. The problem is decomposed into constraint extraction, candidate schedule generation, and iterative verification. Agents are designed for constraint extraction, schedule generation, temporal constraint verification, and preference constraint verification; `generate_alternative_schedule` generates alternative schedules when verifications fail. The `main` function orchestrates the process, calling `extract_constraints`, `generate_candidate_schedule`, and `verify_schedule`, which in turn calls `verify_temporal_constraints`, `verify_preference_constraints`, and `generate_alternative_schedule`. `call_llm` interfaces with the Gemini API to execute prompts.",

This is evident in all error cases where the proposed time conflicts with specified preferences or existing schedules.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust verification process to ensure the proposed time is valid against all constraints. This leads to suggesting times that are already blocked.\n*   **Inability to find a valid schedule:** Even when a valid schedule exists the system fails to produce one in some cases (sample 0)\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Incorrect Constraint Application:** The primary bottleneck is the incorrect application of participant schedules and preferences. The system isn't accurately filtering available time slots based on these constraints.\n*   **Weak Solution Verification:** Lack of a robust process to verify solutions against all constraints before outputting.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Disregard of Preferences:** The system overlooks \"do not want to meet before/after\" preferences. This pattern appears in samples 1 and 4.\n*   **Incorrect Busy Time Calculation:** The system does not correctly calculate busy times leading to proposing times when people are busy, sample 1.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the **incorrect implementation of the constraint handling logic**. Specifically, the system incorrectly parses, stores, or applies the existing schedules and preference constraints of the participants, leading to invalid time slots being proposed. The fact that some constraints are followed in some cases, but not in others, suggests inconsistent application of constraint rules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Needs major improvement to correctly parse and apply all constraints.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Develop a robust verification step that checks the proposed solution against all schedules and constraints.\n*   **Error Logging and Debugging:** Implement more verbose logging to track which constraints are being considered and how the system is determining availability.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement Unit Tests for Constraint Handling:** Create unit tests to specifically validate the constraint handling logic. These tests should cover all possible scenarios, including different combinations of schedules and preferences. Use assertions to check the availability of time slots after applying each constraint.\n2.  **Develop a Detailed Constraint Application Trace:** During execution, log each constraint being considered and how it affects the available time slots. This will help pinpoint where the system is failing to apply constraints correctly. For example:\n    ```\n    Constraint: Kayla is busy from 12:00 to 13:00\n    Available slots before constraint: [9:00-9:30, 9:30-10:00, ..., 12:00-12:30, 13:00-13:30, ...]\n    Available slots after constraint: [9:00-9:30, 9:30-10:00, ..., 11:30-12:00, 13:30-14:00, ...]\n    ```\n3.  **Create a Solution Verification Module:** Before outputting the proposed time, create a dedicated verification module that checks the proposed time against all participants' schedules and preferences. This module should return `True` only if all constraints are satisfied; otherwise, it returns `False` and triggers the system to search for another solution.\n4. **Improve Prompting**: Improve the prompt by using multiple diverse examples that demonstrate constraints.\n5. **Iterative Improvement with Logging**: Integrate logging and tracing into an iterative debugging workflow.

While there are no explicit Python runtime errors (like JSONDecodeError or NameError), the *lack* of successful schedule generation represents a *logical* runtime error.

However, its core scheduling logic and constraint handling are severely flawed, leading to very low accuracy. The system can be considered to have *minimal viable functionality* for the intended task, but is far from production-ready.

A robust and accurate constraint handling mechanism is the foundation upon which all other scheduling capabilities depend. Without correctly applying constraints, the system will continue to produce invalid and unusable results.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Detailed Logging & Tracing within the Constraint Handling Logic:** Add extremely verbose logging within the constraint handling functions to track exactly *which* constraints are being considered for each participant, the available time slots *before* applying the constraint, and the resulting available time slots *after* applying the constraint. Print the relevant data structures (e.g., participant schedules) before and after each constraint application. Make sure there is a log entry for each type of constraint to see which constraints are being applied. Focus on the steps that the LLM is taking to generate solutions.\n2.  **Develop LLM-Driven Constraint Understanding and Filtering:** Have the LLM extract and explicitly represent the constraints from the input text in a structured format (e.g., JSON). Then, use a filtering function (either LLM driven or a code function) to filter potential time slots based on these constraints. The prompting should focus on constraint satisfaction and the output format.\n3.  **Implement LLM-Driven Solution Verification:** Before outputting a proposed time, prompt the LLM to explicitly verify that the proposed time meets *all* constraints. Provide it with the proposed time, the participant schedules, and the constraint list, and ask it to confirm or deny validity. If the LLM denies validity, trigger the system to search for another solution. Use multiple diverse examples in the prompt that clearly represent constraint handling.\n4.  **Few-Shot Prompting**: Use multiple diverse examples in the prompts to demonstrate the constraint logic. This could be implemented in the constraint understanding, filtering and solution verification steps.\n5.  **Prompt Refinement for Solution Generation**: Refine the prompt to encourage the LLM to generate more diverse potential meeting times. Also implement a check to verify all participants are available at the time, potentially implemented in a separate \"agent\" or function.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to assess the capability trend. The single accuracy score of 0.40 provides no information on whether the system is improving, declining, or stable. To assess the trend, it's necessary to track accuracy and error patterns over multiple iterations of development and testing. However, from the error types, it can be inferred that the system is not performing much better than random, suggesting a need for significant improvement.\n",

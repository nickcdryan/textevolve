  "approach_summary": "The script uses a hierarchical decomposition approach to solve grid transformation problems by breaking it down into three steps: identifying the transformation type, extracting transformation parameters, and applying the transformation. Each step is handled by a dedicated function (`identify_transformation_type`, `extract_transformation_parameters`, and `apply_transformation`), each acting as an agent with a specific role. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates these steps, while `call_llm` interacts with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves first identifying the transformation type, then extracting parameters based on the type, and finally, generating the transformed grid using the extracted information.",

Let's analyze the provided examples to understand the transformation rules.\n\n1.  **Column Selection:** The transformation focuses on columns 1, 2, 4, and 5 (0-indexed). These columns will be combined to create new columns 1 and 2 in the output grid. Note that column index 3 is the 1 column in all the grids, and it disappears in all of the solutions.\n\n2.  **Value Replacement:**\n    *   If all the contracted values in a row for a new column are '9', the new value becomes '0'.\n    *   If all the contracted values in a row for a new column are '0', the new value becomes '8'.\n    *   Otherwise, no values for any column indices other than the column indices stated should change.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to the test input:\n\nInput Grid:\n```\n[\n  [9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],\n  [0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n  [9, 9, 0, 1, 0, 9, 0],\n  [9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 0, 9],\n  [0, 9, 9, 1, 0, 9, 9]\n]\n```\n\nOutput Grid Construction:\n\n*   **Column 1 (contracted from columns 1 and 2 of input):**\n    *   Row 0: Input\\[0][1] is 9, Input\\[0][2] is 0.

Otherwise, the new value is the original Input\\[0][1] = 0 if Input\\[0][1] == 0 and Input\\[0][2] == 9. For Input\\[0][1] = 9 and Input\\[0][2] == 0, it is still 0, which is the Input\\[0][2].

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT - AI System\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n**System Version:** (Assumed - please fill in actual version)\n\n### PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n**Sample 0:** The code generates a grid with 1s in rows containing 1, 2s in columns containing 2, and 3s in rows containing 3. This is a plausible attempt to implement a transformation, but it is not the *correct* transformation based on the prompt's implicit rules. The double loop with `if r in rows_with_1:` etc. is redundant and inefficient. The special `else` clause in the first nested loop (`else: new_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c] if grid[r][c] !=1 and grid[r][c] != 2 and grid[r][c] != 3 else 0`) shows an attempt to prevent the program from incorrectly overwriting cells, but ultimately fails to do so. This output exhibits basic code generation ability, but flawed logic.\n\n**Sample 1:** The code implements an ad-hoc transformation based on specific row and column indices. It's highly inflexible and doesn't generalize. It appears to be trying to remove or modify values at specific locations (e.g., `if 3 <= r <= 12 and c == 4: output_grid[r][c] = 0`). This indicates that the system failed to learn general rules and resorted to hardcoding specific cases from the training data, which is a major problem.\n\n**Sample 2:** The response starts with a textual explanation of the supposed transformation rules. This is good in principle. However, the explanation itself is convoluted and difficult to understand (e.g., \"the new value is Input\\[0][1] = 9 if Input\\[0][1] == 0 and Input\\[0][2] == 0\"). The value replacement logic is confusing. The extracted rules are inaccurate and don't consistently match the example in the problem description. The subsequent application of these rules to the test input leads to an incorrect output grid. The \"Unterminated string\" error during runtime suggests a code generation failure, likely caused by invalid escaping or other string formatting issues when printing the output.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently exhibits *very low* overall capability. While it can generate syntactically correct code and extract some information from problem descriptions, it fails to generalize patterns, reason logically about transformations, and produce correct solutions. The tendency to resort to ad-hoc rules is a significant concern.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system generates executable Python code. While the code is often flawed, the ability to produce syntactically correct code provides a foundation for future improvements.\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system demonstrates some capability to extract parameters and constraints from the problem descriptions (though it often does so incompletely and incorrectly).\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** This is the *most critical* weakness. The system cannot generalize transformation patterns from training examples to novel inputs. This is evidenced by the hardcoded indices and specific value checks in Sample 1 and the incorrect rule extraction in Sample 2.\n*   **Logical Reasoning:** The system struggles with logical deduction. The transformation rules are often misinterpreted, leading to flawed code implementations.\n*   **Solution Verification:** There is no mechanism to verify the correctness of the generated solutions.\n*   **Robustness:** The \"Unterminated string\" error in Sample 2 shows a lack of robustness in handling string formatting.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**. The system *must* learn to identify underlying transformation rules rather than memorizing specific examples.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Rule-Based System with Symbolic Representation:**\n    *   Before generating code, force the system to explicitly extract the transformation rules into a structured, symbolic format. For example, represent a transformation as \"IF cell(r, c) == X THEN cell(r+1, c-1) = Y\".\n    *   Use these symbolic rules to derive the transformation logic, instead of directly generating code from the problem description.\n    *   This will make the system's reasoning process more transparent and easier to debug.\n\n2.  **Curriculum Learning:**\n    *   Start with very simple transformation tasks, gradually increasing complexity.\n    *   This will help the system learn basic pattern recognition skills before tackling more challenging problems.\n\n3.  **Introduce Solution Verification (even a simple one):**\n    *   Implement a simple verification mechanism that tests the generated code on a small number of test cases (separate from the training data).\n    *   Even a basic verification step can help identify and correct some errors.\n    *   This would involve comparing the output grid to a known solution and raising a flag if discrepancies are found.\n\n4.  **Improve String Handling:**\n    *   Review the code generation process to identify potential issues with string formatting and escaping.\n    *   Implement more robust error handling to prevent runtime errors caused by string parsing problems.\n    *   Add unit tests specifically targeting string generation.\n\n5.  **Augment Training Data:**\n    *   Generate more diverse training data with variations in grid size, element values, and transformation patterns.\n    *   Include negative examples (i.e., examples where the transformation *should not* be applied).\n    *   This helps the model to learn the precise conditions under which transformations should be applied.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level**. Without significant changes in the architecture and training process, the system is unlikely to improve substantially. The ad-hoc solutions and lack of generalization highlight a fundamental limitation.\n",

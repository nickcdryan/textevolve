  "approach_summary": "The script employs a chain-of-thought approach to solve grid transformation problems using the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into rule extraction, verification, application, and formatting steps, leveraging specialized agent roles for each. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini model. The script uses `analyze_grid_transformation` to extract, verify and apply rules to a given question by calling `call_llm`. Finally, the `main` function calls `analyze_grid_transformation` and returns the answer.",

The numbers in the grids represent different colors, and your job is to identify the underlying abstract pattern or rule used across all training example pairs and apply it to new test input.\n\n                                0: Black (sometimes interpreted as background/empty)\n                                1: Blue\n                                2: Red\n                                3: Green\n                                4: Yellow\n                                5: Gray\n                                6: Pink\n                                7: Orange\n                                8: Cyan\n                                9: Purple\n\n\n                                These tasks involve abstract reasoning and visual pattern recognition operations such as:\n                                - Pattern recognition and completion\n                                - Object identification and manipulation\n                                - Spatial transformations (rotation, reflection, translation, movement, groupings, sizes, etc.)\n                                - Color/shape transformations\n                                - Counting and arithmetic operations\n                                - Boolean operations (AND, OR, XOR)\n\n                                First, analyze each example pair carefully and examine the similarities across different example pairs. Look for consistent abstract rules across example pairs that transform each input into its corresponding output. There is a single meta rule or meta transformation sequence that applies to all the example training pairs. Then apply the inferred rule to solve the test case.\n\n                                Explain your reasoning and describe the transformation rule you've identified.

This suggests a fundamental failure in the initial stages of processing, likely related to pattern recognition or algorithm application. The system could not identify a valid transformation rule within the given example.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system produced an output grid that does not follow any clear patterns. It appears the system attempted to generate a grid based on some rule, but the rule is either flawed or the execution of that rule is incorrect.\n*   The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags are consistently present.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system's current capabilities are limited. While it demonstrates an ability to attempt rule extraction and code generation, the core function of correctly inferring and applying abstract rules from grid transformations is significantly flawed. The accuracy of 33% (1/3) highlights the issues in the system.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n1.  **Instruction Following:** The system attempts to follow instructions by generating a response within the given output format.\n2.  **Code Generation/Execution:** The system attempts to generate and execute code. The ability to generate and execute code provides a framework for complex computations, so it's a strength.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n1.  **Rule Extraction:** The system struggles to extract valid transformation rules from the training examples. This is the most significant weakness.\n2.  **Generalization:** It struggles to generalize learned rules to new inputs.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition:** Deficient in recognizing and understanding patterns within the grids.\n4.  **Output Correctness:** Output grids are frequently incorrect and don't reflect the learned transformations.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Rule Extraction**. Without a robust and reliable method for identifying transformation rules, the system cannot perform its core function.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Debugging and Logging:** Implement extensive logging and debugging statements within the rule extraction module. Specifically:\n    *   Print the input and output grids for each training example.\n    *   Print the steps the rule extraction algorithm takes.\n    *   Print the rule that is extracted (or attempted to be extracted) for each example.\n    *   Print statements before/after each step in the logic transformation process.\n    *   Print the final output grid.\n    *   Check variable types.\n    *   Ensure valid inputs are passed into the code.\n2.  **Focus on Simpler Test Cases:** Design a suite of test cases with simple, well-defined rules (e.g., shifting rows, inverting colors, rotating grids). These simpler examples will be easier to debug and allow the system to build a foundation for handling more complex transformations.\n3.  **Modularization:** Break down the rule extraction and transformation logic into smaller, more manageable functions. For example:\n    *   `identify_pattern(input_grid, output_grid)`:  This function focuses solely on identifying the underlying pattern.\n    *   `apply_rule(input_grid, rule)`: This function applies the extracted rule to the test input.\n\n**Example Implementation Snippet for Recommendations Above:**\n\n```python\ndef identify_pattern(input_grid, output_grid):\n    \"\"\"Identifies the transformation pattern between two grids.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Input Grid:\\n\", input_grid)  # Recommendation 1: Logging\n    print(\"Output Grid:\\n\", output_grid) # Recommendation 1: Logging\n\n    # [Existing pattern identification logic]\n    if rule is None:\n        print(\"Error: No rule extracted\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Extracted Rule:\\n\", rule) # Recommendation 1: Logging\n    return rule\n\ndef apply_rule(input_grid, rule):\n    \"\"\"Applies the extracted rule to the input grid.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Applying Rule:\", rule, \"to input grid:\\n\", input_grid) # Recommendation 1: Logging\n\n    # [Existing rule application logic]\n    transformed_grid = ... #Apply rules.\n\n    print(\"Transformed Grid:\\n\", transformed_grid) # Recommendation 1: Logging\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the current accuracy (0.33), the system's capabilities are currently **stable, but low**. Without significant improvements to rule extraction, generalization, and pattern recognition, the system will continue to perform poorly. The implemented logging functions can help improve accuracy.\n",

While it demonstrates an ability to attempt rule extraction and code generation, the core function of correctly inferring and applying abstract rules from grid transformations is significantly flawed. The accuracy of 33% (1/3) highlights the issues in the system.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n1.  **Instruction Following:** The system attempts to follow instructions by generating a response within the given output format.\n2.  **Code Generation/Execution:** The system attempts to generate and execute code. The ability to generate and execute code provides a framework for complex computations, so it's a strength.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n1.  **Rule Extraction:** The system struggles to extract valid transformation rules from the training examples. This is the most significant weakness.\n2.  **Generalization:** It struggles to generalize learned rules to new inputs.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition:** Deficient in recognizing and understanding patterns within the grids.\n4.  **Output Correctness:** Output grids are frequently incorrect and don't reflect the learned transformations.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Rule Extraction**. Without a robust and reliable method for identifying transformation rules, the system cannot perform its core function.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Debugging and Logging:** Implement extensive logging and debugging statements within the rule extraction module. Specifically:\n    *   Print the input and output grids for each training example.\n    *   Print the steps the rule extraction algorithm takes.\n    *   Print the rule that is extracted (or attempted to be extracted) for each example.\n    *   Print statements before/after each step in the logic transformation process.\n    *   Print the final output grid.\n    *   Check variable types.\n    *   Ensure valid inputs are passed into the code.\n2.  **Focus on Simpler Test Cases:** Design a suite of test cases with simple, well-defined rules (e.g., shifting rows, inverting colors, rotating grids). These simpler examples will be easier to debug and allow the system to build a foundation for handling more complex transformations.\n3.  **Modularization:** Break down the rule extraction and transformation logic into smaller, more manageable functions. For example:\n    *   `identify_pattern(input_grid, output_grid)`:  This function focuses solely on identifying the underlying pattern.\n    *   `apply_rule(input_grid, rule)`: This function applies the extracted rule to the test input.\n\n**Example Implementation Snippet for Recommendations Above:**\n\n```python\ndef identify_pattern(input_grid, output_grid):\n    \"\"\"Identifies the transformation pattern between two grids.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Input Grid:\\n\", input_grid)  # Recommendation 1: Logging\n    print(\"Output Grid:\\n\", output_grid) # Recommendation 1: Logging\n\n    # [Existing pattern identification logic]\n    if rule is None:\n        print(\"Error: No rule extracted\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Extracted Rule:\\n\", rule) # Recommendation 1: Logging\n    return rule\n\ndef apply_rule(input_grid, rule):\n    \"\"\"Applies the extracted rule to the input grid.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Applying Rule:\", rule, \"to input grid:\\n\", input_grid) # Recommendation 1: Logging\n\n    # [Existing rule application logic]\n    transformed_grid = ... #Apply rules.\n\n    print(\"Transformed Grid:\\n\", transformed_grid) # Recommendation 1: Logging\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the current accuracy (0.33), the system's capabilities are currently **stable, but low**. Without significant improvements to rule extraction, generalization, and pattern recognition, the system will continue to perform poorly. The implemented logging functions can help improve accuracy.\n"

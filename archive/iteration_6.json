It is inspired by\nimage processing techniques that look for recurring patterns to transform and clean up images.\n\nHypothesis: Identifying repeating sub-structures (\"motifs\") in the input grid and mapping their\ntransformation to the output grid can provide a robust way to generalize transformations, even\nwith limited examples. This approach seeks to go beyond simple pattern matching by understanding\nthe relationship between these motifs and their transformations.\n\nThis script attempts a new approach:\n1. Motifs are recognized as repeating subgrids.\n2. The relationship between these motifs across training examples are analyzed to\ndeduce transformations.\n3. A 'transformation' in this sense means the relationship between a subgrid and its new version in the ouptut grids.\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union\n\ndef call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):\n    \"\"\"Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. \"\"\"\n    try:\n        from google import genai\n        from google.genai import types\n\n        # Initialize the Gemini client\n        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get(\"GEMINI_API_KEY\"))\n\n        # Call the API with system instruction if provided\n        if system_instruction:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\", \n                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n                    system_instruction=system_instruction\n                ),\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n        else:\n            response = client.models.generate_content(\n                model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n                contents=prompt\n            )\n\n        return response.text\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}\")\n        return f\"Error: {str(e)}\"\n\ndef extract_motifs_and_transformations(question: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Extract repeating motifs and their transformations from the training examples.\"\"\"\n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are an expert grid analyst.

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by identifying and applying local structural motifs using an LLM. It decomposes the problem into motif extraction, transformation analysis, and application of the transformation to the test grid. Three agent roles are involved: grid analyst, grid transformer, and grid format verifier. The functions `extract_motifs_and_transformations` analyzes the question and calls the LLM to identify motifs and their transformations, `apply_motif_transformation` uses the LLM to apply the transformations to the input grid based on the motif analysis, and `verify_output_format` uses the LLM to verifies the format of the generated grid. The overall workflow involves extracting the test input, analyzing motifs, applying transformations, verifying the output format, and returning the transformed grid.",

However, it struggles with complex or nuanced patterns.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system consistently formats the output into a grid-like structure, suggesting that the output formatting component is functioning correctly.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Complex Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to accurately identify and apply complex patterns involving multiple constraints or dependencies between elements in the input and output grids.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Learned Patterns:** Even when a pattern seems to be partially recognized, the system often applies it inconsistently or incorrectly to the entire test input.\n*   **Failure to Generalize:** The system's performance degrades significantly when the test input deviates slightly from the training examples.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** Even subtle variations in input data seem to result in drastically different and incorrect outputs.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Pattern Identification and Application:** The system's inability to accurately identify and apply the correct transformation patterns from the training examples is the most critical bottleneck. This is evident in all three error cases, where the generated outputs bear little resemblance to the golden answers.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Overgeneralization:** The system appears to be overgeneralizing from limited training data, leading to incorrect transformations. For example, in sample 0, it applies the values \"2\" and \"3\" across the board, without regard for the existing \"1\" and \"0\" values in the test input or the positions where these numbers should be placed.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Constraints:** The system often misinterprets the constraints presented in the training examples. This can lead to applying transformations in the wrong locations or failing to consider existing relationships within the input grid.\n*   **Dimensionality Confusion:** As observed in the 3rd error case, there is a misunderstanding of the proper dimensions for the output. The system created arrays of length 2 when it should have been length 3.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's failure to accurately extract and apply the relevant transformation patterns from the training examples to the test input, resulting in wildly incorrect grid outputs.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** The system needs significant improvement in its ability to identify and understand complex transformation patterns in the training data.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system must be able to correctly identify and apply constraints that dictate where and how transformations should occur.\n*   **Reasoning about Grid Structure:** The system needs to better understand the spatial relationships within the grids and how transformations affect these relationships.\n*   **Output dimension validation:** The system needs to validate whether the output has the same dimensions as the input.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Enhanced Pattern Recognition Algorithms:** Experiment with more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms, such as those based on convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks, which are better suited for capturing spatial relationships and complex dependencies in grid data.\n*   **Constraint Extraction and Encoding:** Implement a mechanism to explicitly extract and encode constraints from the training examples. These constraints could be represented as rules or logical expressions that guide the transformation process.\n*   **Attention Mechanisms:** Incorporate attention mechanisms that allow the system to focus on the most relevant parts of the input grid when applying transformations. This can help to avoid overgeneralization and ensure that transformations are applied in the correct locations.\n*   **Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data with variations of the existing examples to improve the system's ability to generalize to unseen inputs.

While it identifies \"2\" and \"3\" as important numbers, it fails to place them correctly relative to the existing \"1\" and \"0\" values and ignores the constraint to preserve the pre-existing \"1\" and \"0\" values.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system populates the grid largely with \"0,\" \"3,\" and \"4,\" but it fails to recognize the correct positions or quantities of each of these values to satisfy the constraints. The system completely fails to recognize how the new values should interact with the old values.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system generates a 2D array with incorrect dimensions (5x2 instead of 5x3), and the chosen value \"8\" and \"0\" have nothing to do with the grid, implying a complete breakdown in pattern recognition. The system fails to consider the number of input dimensions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates extremely limited capabilities in solving tasks that require pattern recognition and constraint satisfaction on grid-based data. While it can format the output correctly, its core reasoning and transformation abilities are essentially non-functional, indicated by the 0% accuracy and detailed error analysis. It struggles with generalization and is highly sensitive to even minor variations in input data.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** Consistent and correct output formatting provides a foundation to build upon, suggesting that the basic infrastructure for generating structured data is in place.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Application:** The system's inability to extract, understand, and apply complex transformation patterns is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system consistently fails to respect constraints within the input grids.\n*   **Generalization:** The system shows a severe inability to generalize to unseen inputs, even with small variations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition & Application**. Without this, the system cannot solve even the simplest problems presented.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Focus on a Simplified Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** Start with a simpler pattern recognition algorithm (e.g., template matching with local search) before moving to more complex neural network architectures. This allows for easier debugging and understanding of the system's behavior.\n2.  **Implement Explicit Constraint Checking:** Introduce a module that explicitly checks constraints derived from the training examples before applying transformations.  This could involve defining rules based on the relationships between input and output grids. For example, if a cell contains value X in the input, enforce a constraint that it must be transformed to value Y in the output *if* there is a pattern for this transformation in the training examples.\n3.  **Add Feature Engineering:** Add feature engineering step to identify numerical or spatial patterns in both input and output grids.\n4.  **Implement Output Dimension Validation:** Implement a simple check to ensure that the output grid has the same dimensions (number of rows and columns) as the input grid. This will immediately address the issue observed in Sample 2.\n5.  **Intermediate step analysis:** Add print statements to show intermediate outputs so the reasoning path can be traced later.\n6.  **Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data with variations of the existing examples to improve the system's ability to generalize to unseen inputs. This could involve adding noise, rotating the grids, or changing the values of certain elements.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the current performance of 0% accuracy, the capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. Improvement will only be seen after significant changes are made to the pattern recognition and constraint handling mechanisms.\n",

This could involve adding noise, rotating the grids, or changing the values of certain elements.\n*   **Intermediate Step Analysis:** Add print statements to show intermediate outputs so the reasoning path can be traced later.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to accurately extract the transformation pattern.\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed to identify the correct constraints for applying the transformation.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an invalid solution based on the incorrect transformation.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed to verify the solution against the correct constraints.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to extract all relevant information.\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed to identify the constraints for applying the transformation.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an invalid solution based on the incorrect transformation.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed to verify the solution against the correct constraints.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failed to accurately extract the transformation pattern.\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed to identify the correct constraints for applying the transformation.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Generated an invalid solution based on the incorrect transformation.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed to verify the solution against the correct constraints.\n\n## SAMPLE EXECUTION OUTPUTS:\n\n```\n[\n  \"ANSWER_START\\n```\\n[\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n[2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\\n]\\n```\\nANSWER_END\\n\",\n  \"ANSWER_START\\n```\\n[\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\n[0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\\n]\\n```\\nANSWER_END\\n\",\n  \"ANSWER_START\\n```\\n[\\n  [8, 8],\\n  [8, 8],\\n  [8, 8],\\n  [0, 0],\\n  [8, 8]\\n]\\n```\\nANSWER_END\\n\"\n]\n```\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system heavily overgeneralizes the transformation. While it identifies \"2\" and \"3\" as important numbers, it fails to place them correctly relative to the existing \"1\" and \"0\" values and ignores the constraint to preserve the pre-existing \"1\" and \"0\" values.\n*   **Sample 1:** The system populates the grid largely with \"0,\" \"3,\" and \"4,\" but it fails to recognize the correct positions or quantities of each of these values to satisfy the constraints. The system completely fails to recognize how the new values should interact with the old values.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system generates a 2D array with incorrect dimensions (5x2 instead of 5x3), and the chosen value \"8\" and \"0\" have nothing to do with the grid, implying a complete breakdown in pattern recognition. The system fails to consider the number of input dimensions.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently demonstrates extremely limited capabilities in solving tasks that require pattern recognition and constraint satisfaction on grid-based data. While it can format the output correctly, its core reasoning and transformation abilities are essentially non-functional, indicated by the 0% accuracy and detailed error analysis. It struggles with generalization and is highly sensitive to even minor variations in input data.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** Consistent and correct output formatting provides a foundation to build upon, suggesting that the basic infrastructure for generating structured data is in place.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition & Application:** The system's inability to extract, understand, and apply complex transformation patterns is the most critical weakness.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system consistently fails to respect constraints within the input grids.\n*   **Generalization:** The system shows a severe inability to generalize to unseen inputs, even with small variations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition & Application**. Without this, the system cannot solve even the simplest problems presented.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Focus on a Simplified Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** Start with a simpler pattern recognition algorithm (e.g., template matching with local search) before moving to more complex neural network architectures. This allows for easier debugging and understanding of the system's behavior.\n2.  **Implement Explicit Constraint Checking:** Introduce a module that explicitly checks constraints derived from the training examples before applying transformations.  This could involve defining rules based on the relationships between input and output grids. For example, if a cell contains value X in the input, enforce a constraint that it must be transformed to value Y in the output *if* there is a pattern for this transformation in the training examples.\n3.  **Add Feature Engineering:** Add feature engineering step to identify numerical or spatial patterns in both input and output grids.\n4.  **Implement Output Dimension Validation:** Implement a simple check to ensure that the output grid has the same dimensions (number of rows and columns) as the input grid. This will immediately address the issue observed in Sample 2.\n5.  **Intermediate step analysis:** Add print statements to show intermediate outputs so the reasoning path can be traced later.\n6.  **Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data with variations of the existing examples to improve the system's ability to generalize to unseen inputs. This could involve adding noise, rotating the grids, or changing the values of certain elements.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nGiven the current performance of 0% accuracy, the capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. Improvement will only be seen after significant changes are made to the pattern recognition and constraint handling mechanisms.\n"

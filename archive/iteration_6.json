Study the examples carefully and explain the transformation logic in plain English.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n    Output Grid:\n    [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]\n    Explanation: Each element in the input grid becomes a diagonal in a larger grid. The '1' values are moved to create diagonals.\n\n    Example 2:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[2, 8], [8, 2]]\n    Output Grid:\n    [[2, 2, 8, 8], [2, 2, 8, 8], [8, 8, 2, 2], [8, 8, 2, 2]]\n    Explanation: Each element is expanded to a 2x2 block with the element's value. The element repeats to fill a 2x2 area.\n\n    Example 3:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]\n    Output Grid:\n    [[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]\n    Explanation: The input grid is overlaid onto a grid of zeros; the value of 1 replaces 0; the values of 0 remain as 0.

  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM in a two-step process: rule extraction and rule application, acting as a grid transformation expert. The problem is decomposed into identifying the transformation rule from example grids and then applying this rule to a new input grid. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates this, using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model. The `call_llm` function takes a prompt and system instruction and retrieves a response from the Gemini model. The workflow involves creating prompts with example grids, extracting transformation rules using `call_llm`, applying the extracted rule to generate a transformed grid with `call_llm`, and returning the result.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere were no explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError reported in the provided 'output' fields. However, the incorrect outputs suggest logical errors within the code execution.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can successfully generate syntactically correct Python code that executes without crashing.\n*   **Information Extraction:** It appears to be able to extract relevant information like the input grid and its dimensions.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Abstraction:** The system struggles to correctly identify and abstract the transformation patterns from the training examples to apply to the test input, resulting in flawed logic.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system fails to handle constraints and conditions correctly during transformation, leading to incorrect value propagation and cell assignments in the output grid.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Incorrect Pattern Abstraction:** The core bottleneck is the system's inability to correctly infer the transformation rules from the examples and implement them in the generated code. This leads to the generated code following an incorrect logic that deviates from the intended pattern.\n*   **Flawed Logic Implementation:** The transformation logic within the generated code is often flawed, leading to incorrect calculations, value propagations, and ultimately, incorrect output grids.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Value Propagation:** In grid transformation tasks, a common error pattern is incorrect value propagation where the system either propagates values to the wrong cells or fails to propagate them according to the examples.\n*   **Incorrect Pair Detection and Extension:** In some instances, the system struggles with identifying the correct cell pairings and subsequently extending the transformation rule to adjacent cells correctly.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the system's weak **Pattern Recognition and Abstraction capability**. It fails to accurately understand the underlying rules and constraints governing grid transformations, resulting in code that implements incorrect or incomplete transformations. This manifests as both incorrect value propagation and faulty adjacency logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the ability to identify and abstract patterns from the training examples, including how values interact and propagate within the grid.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Refine the system's ability to correctly handle constraints and conditions that determine how transformations are applied to the grid. This involves improving its understanding of conditions based on cell adjacency and values.\n*   **Solution Verification:** Implement more rigorous solution verification steps to identify discrepancies between the generated output and the expected transformation based on the training examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n*   **Enhanced Training Data Analysis:** Implement a module that explicitly analyzes training examples to identify key transformation rules, constraints, and relationships between cells. This module could, for example, identify that a '1' surrounded by 9's maps to a specific output, or that certain values propagate horizontally or vertically under certain conditions.\n*   **Intermediate State Visualization:** Add functionality to visualize intermediate grid states during the transformation process, allowing for easier debugging and identification of incorrect transformation steps.

The logic within the generated code is deeply flawed.\n*   **Inconsistent Logic:** The code's logic often seems arbitrary and disconnected from the training examples (which we don't see directly, but can infer from the desired behavior). There are many `if/elif` conditions that don't logically follow a clear pattern from the problem statement.\n*   **Lack of Generalization:** The system appears to be overfitting to specific aspects of the training examples without understanding the underlying transformation rules.\n\n**Specific Sample Analysis:**\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The code iterates through the grid and attempts to propagate the value of the first non-zero cell in each row downwards. This is a naive approach that ignores the broader patterns and constraints that define the transformation. The `break` statement further limits the logic. The propagation logic only considers one non-zero value per row.\n*   **Sample 1:** The generated code appears to focus on identifying and extending pairs of equal values horizontally and vertically, but the implementation is flawed. The output grid is incomplete. The logic doesn't handle complex relationships between cells or propagate the values appropriately according to example grids.\n*   **Sample 2:** This example specifically searches for the index of the number \"1\" in a row, but its subsequent conditional logic for assigning \"8\" to neighboring cells seems haphazard and not representative of a general transformation rule. It also demonstrates a misunderstanding or misapplication of the cell adjacency rules. The `if/elif` statements are convoluted and don't establish a clear mapping from input to output.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates limited capabilities in solving grid transformation tasks. While it can generate executable code and extract basic information, it fails to:\n\n*   **Accurately recognize and abstract transformation patterns from training examples.**\n*   **Translate these patterns into correct, generalized code logic.**\n*   **Handle constraints and conditional relationships within the grid.**\n\nOverall, the system's problem-solving ability for this type of task is extremely low.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** Generates syntactically valid and executable Python code.  This is a foundational strength, but insufficient on its own.\n*   **Information Extraction:** Can identify and extract relevant data, such as the grid dimensions and values.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Abstraction:** This is the most critical weakness. The system cannot correctly identify the underlying transformation rules.\n*   **Flawed Logic Implementation:** The generated code's transformation logic is consistently incorrect and does not achieve the desired results.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Unable to effectively incorporate constraints into the transformation process. The logic is too simplistic and does not consider the complex relationships between cells.\n*   **Generalization:** Fails to generalize learned patterns to new, unseen grid configurations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Abstraction**. Without improvements here, the other weaknesses will persist.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Pattern Analysis Module:** Create a module specifically designed to analyze training examples and extract key transformation rules. This module should:\n    *   Identify cell dependencies and value relationships (e.g., \"if cell (x,y) is 1, then cell (x+1, y) becomes 8\").\n    *   Detect propagation patterns (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).\n    *   Recognize constraints based on cell adjacency (e.g., \"only propagate if adjacent cell is 0\").\n    *   Represent these rules in a structured format (e.g., a knowledge graph or rule-based system).\n2.  **Revise Code Generation for Constraint Awareness:** The code generation process should be significantly altered to incorporate the rules and constraints identified by the pattern analysis module. Use conditional statements (`if/else`) to enforce the transformation rules based on cell values and adjacency.\n3.  **Add Intermediate State Visualization and Logging:**\n    *   Add print statements within the generated code to display the grid's state *at each step* of the transformation.\n    *   Log the values of key variables, such as cell indices, values being propagated, and the results of conditional checks.\n    *   This will make it easier to diagnose *where* the logic fails.\n4.  **Enhanced Training Data Handling:** Even without access to training data, ensure your system is designed to handle diverse grid sizes, value ranges, and transformation types. Consider data augmentation techniques.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe system's capabilities are currently **stable (at a very low level)**. Without significant improvements in pattern recognition, there is no reason to expect the performance to improve. The current architecture does not seem adequate for solving these kinds of problems.\n",

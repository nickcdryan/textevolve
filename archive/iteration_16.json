  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by using an LLM in two stages: information extraction and meeting scheduling. The `main` function orchestrates the process by first calling `extract_meeting_info` to extract participants, duration, days, and existing schedules from the input question using few-shot examples and LLM-based validation. If extraction is successful, `schedule_meeting` is called to propose a meeting time using extracted details and also using few-shot examples. `call_llm` handles communication with the Gemini API, used for both extraction and scheduling tasks with system instructions to guide the LLM's behavior, and returns the proposed time.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNone of the provided error cases exhibit explicit runtime errors such as JSONDecodeError or TypeError in the provided data. This suggests the core execution is likely completing without crashing. However, the *reasoning* within the system is flawed, leading to incorrect answers.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** The system appears to be able to decompose the meeting scheduling problem into identifying participants, their schedules, and constraints.\n2.  **Constraint Identification:** The system successfully identifies constraints related to work hours, participant availability, and meeting duration.\n3.  **Structured Output:** The system consistently produces a structured output in the format \"Here is the proposed time: ...\", indicating adherence to an output template.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The system frequently fails to correctly apply all constraints when generating potential solutions. Specifically, there seem to be issues identifying time slots that are *truly* free for *all* participants.\n2.  **Limited Reasoning Depth:** The system's reasoning process appears to be shallow. It may stop at finding *a* feasible solution without thoroughly exploring all possibilities and selecting the *best* one according to implicit or explicit preferences (e.g., \"Amy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday\").\n3.  **Lack of Verification:** The system does not appear to have a dedicated solution verification step to confirm that the generated time slot adheres to all constraints before presenting it as the answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Constraint Satisfaction Logic:** The core bottleneck is the system's inability to reliably find time slots that satisfy *all* given constraints. This includes accurately interpreting availability schedules and respecting preferences.\n2.  **Solution Verification:** A missing or inadequate solution verification module prevents the system from identifying and correcting errors before providing a final answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Time Slot Selection:** All error cases involve the selection of an incorrect time slot. This suggests a systematic flaw in the constraint handling and solution generation process.\n2.  **Ignoring Preferences:** In sample 1, the system seems to disregard Amy's preference to avoid scheduling on Monday. This highlights a weakness in incorporating preferences into the solution generation process.\n3.  **Overlooking Blocked Calendars:** The errors suggest that the system misses blocked calendar slots when determining available times for participants.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **unreliable constraint satisfaction logic during solution generation.** The system fails to consistently identify valid time slots by accurately considering all participants' schedules and constraints. This leads to proposing times when one or more participants are unavailable.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** Improve the accuracy of constraint handling by implementing more robust algorithms for identifying available time slots. This could involve a dedicated module for calendar intersection and conflict resolution.\n2.  **Solution Verification:** Introduce a solution verification module that rigorously checks the generated time slot against all constraints before presenting it as the answer.\n3.  **Preference Incorporation:** Enhance the system's ability to incorporate preferences into the solution generation process. This may involve assigning weights to different factors or using a more sophisticated search algorithm.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Calendar Intersection Algorithm:** Implement a calendar intersection algorithm using code (not just LLM reasoning) to precisely determine the overlapping free time for all participants. This algorithm should take the participant's schedules (blocked times) and the meeting duration as inputs and output a list of available time slots.\n2.  **Constraint Validation Module:** Develop a dedicated constraint validation module. This module should take a proposed time slot, participant schedules, and constraints as input, and output a boolean value indicating whether the time slot is valid. Use this module to verify the proposed solution.\n3.  **Re-Act Loop for Conflict Resolution:** Implement a Re-Act loop specifically for resolving scheduling conflicts. If the constraint validation module detects a conflict, the system should re-reason about the constraints, identify the source of the conflict, and propose a different time slot.\n4.  **Preference Scoring:** Develop a scoring mechanism to evaluate potential solutions based on preferences. For example, give a higher score to time slots that avoid preferred days or times.\n5.  **Few-Shot Examples with Detailed Reasoning:** Add few-shot examples to the prompt that demonstrate step-by-step reasoning for constraint handling and conflict resolution. Include examples with diverse constraints and preferences.\n6.  **Hybrid Approach for Constraint Parsing and Logic:** Use the LLM primarily for information extraction (identifying participants, their schedules, and preferences). Then, use deterministic code (calendar intersection algorithm, constraint validation module) to perform the core constraint satisfaction logic.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample 1:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n*   **Sample 4:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

This makes debugging and understanding the system's reasoning opaque.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates basic capabilities in problem decomposition, constraint identification, and structured output generation. However, its core constraint satisfaction logic is unreliable, leading to frequent errors in identifying valid meeting times. A lack of verification and limited reasoning depth further compound the problem.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Output Formatting:** Consistent adherence to the required output format.\n*   **Problem Decomposition:** Ability to break down the scheduling problem into components.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Unreliable Constraint Satisfaction:** Inconsistent and inaccurate handling of constraints, resulting in invalid time slots.\n*   **Lack of Solution Verification:** Absence of a verification step to confirm the validity of the generated solutions.\n*   **Opaque Reasoning:** Inability to understand *why* the system chose a specific time.\n*   **Limited Preference Handling:** Difficulty incorporating preferences into the decision-making process.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\n**Constraint Satisfaction Logic:** This is the single most critical area to improve. The entire system hinges on its ability to reliably find valid time slots.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Calendar Intersection Algorithm (Code):** Replace the LLM's reasoning for finding available times with a deterministic calendar intersection algorithm implemented in Python. This algorithm should take participant schedules and meeting duration as input and output a list of available time slots. This addresses the **Unreliable Constraint Satisfaction** and **Overlooking Blocked Calendars** issues.\n\n    *   *Example:* `available_slots = find_available_slots(participants, meeting_duration)`\n\n2.  **Develop Constraint Validation Module (Code):** Create a separate module that *verifies* if a proposed time slot is valid. This module should take a proposed time slot, participant schedules, and constraints as input and output a boolean. This addresses the **Lack of Solution Verification** issue.\n\n    *   *Example:* `is_valid = validate_slot(proposed_time, participants, constraints)`\n\n3.  **Re-Act Loop for Conflict Resolution:** Wrap the solution generation process in a Re-Act loop. If the constraint validation module finds a conflict, the system should re-reason, identify the source of the conflict, and propose a different time slot.  The loop should have a `max_attempts` limit. This directly addresses the **Incorrect Time Slot Selection** error pattern.\n\n    *   *Example:*\n\n        ```python\n        max_attempts = 3\n        for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n            proposed_time = generate_time_slot(...)\n            is_valid = validate_slot(proposed_time, participants, constraints)\n            if is_valid:\n                break\n            else:\n                # Re-reason with LLM to find a new slot\n                proposed_time = re_reason_and_propose_new_time(...)\n        ```\n\n4.  **Augment Outputs with Reasoning (LLM):** Modify the output format to include *why* the system chose the proposed time.  Use the LLM to generate a concise explanation of the reasoning process, including constraints considered and conflicts resolved.  This addresses the **Opaque Reasoning** weakness.\n\n    *   *Example Prompt Modification:*\n        ```\n        Before providing the time, summarize the reasoning process:\n        \"Here is the proposed time: [Time].  This time was chosen because [Explanation, including constraints considered and conflicts resolved].\"\n        ```\n\n5.  **Few-Shot Example Enhancement:** Create few-shot examples that showcase the new calendar intersection algorithm and constraint validation module in action.  Explicitly show how the system identifies conflicts and resolves them within the Re-Act loop.  Focus on examples with *multiple* complex constraints.\n\n6.  **Preference incorporation:** Re-Act pattern for preference. When the proposed solution generated by LLM does not satisfy some constraints, let LLM self-reflect with the preferences as an additional constraints, generate a more proper solution.\n\n**CAPABILITY MAPPING UPDATES:**\n\n*   **Focus:** Improve reliability of `constraint_handling` and incorporate robust `solution_verification`.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the current data, the system's capabilities are **stable with room to be declining**. While the system can perform basic tasks, its poor accuracy and lack of key features prevent it from being practically useful. The recommended changes are expected to lead to a significant *improvement* in capabilities in the next iteration. Without the improvements, we can expect to see declining trends for accuracy as new, more complex examples are introduced.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNone of the provided error cases exhibit explicit runtime errors such as JSONDecodeError or TypeError in the provided data. This suggests the core execution is likely completing without crashing. However, the *reasoning* within the system is flawed, leading to incorrect answers.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** The system appears to be able to decompose the meeting scheduling problem into identifying participants, their schedules, and constraints.\n2.  **Constraint Identification:** The system successfully identifies constraints related to work hours, participant availability, and meeting duration.\n3.  **Structured Output:** The system consistently produces a structured output in the format \"Here is the proposed time: ...\", indicating adherence to an output template.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The system frequently fails to correctly apply all constraints when generating potential solutions. Specifically, there seem to be issues identifying time slots that are *truly* free for *all* participants.\n2.  **Limited Reasoning Depth:** The system's reasoning process appears to be shallow. It may stop at finding *a* feasible solution without thoroughly exploring all possibilities and selecting the *best* one according to implicit or explicit preferences (e.g., \"Amy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday\").\n3.  **Lack of Verification:** The system does not appear to have a dedicated solution verification step to confirm that the generated time slot adheres to all constraints before presenting it as the answer.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Constraint Satisfaction Logic:** The core bottleneck is the system's inability to reliably find time slots that satisfy *all* given constraints. This includes accurately interpreting availability schedules and respecting preferences.\n2.  **Solution Verification:** A missing or inadequate solution verification module prevents the system from identifying and correcting errors before providing a final answer.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Time Slot Selection:** All error cases involve the selection of an incorrect time slot. This suggests a systematic flaw in the constraint handling and solution generation process.\n2.  **Ignoring Preferences:** In sample 1, the system seems to disregard Amy's preference to avoid scheduling on Monday. This highlights a weakness in incorporating preferences into the solution generation process.\n3.  **Overlooking Blocked Calendars:** The errors suggest that the system misses blocked calendar slots when determining available times for participants.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the **unreliable constraint satisfaction logic during solution generation.** The system fails to consistently identify valid time slots by accurately considering all participants' schedules and constraints. This leads to proposing times when one or more participants are unavailable.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** Improve the accuracy of constraint handling by implementing more robust algorithms for identifying available time slots. This could involve a dedicated module for calendar intersection and conflict resolution.\n2.  **Solution Verification:** Introduce a solution verification module that rigorously checks the generated time slot against all constraints before presenting it as the answer.\n3.  **Preference Incorporation:** Enhance the system's ability to incorporate preferences into the solution generation process. This may involve assigning weights to different factors or using a more sophisticated search algorithm.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Calendar Intersection Algorithm:** Implement a calendar intersection algorithm using code (not just LLM reasoning) to precisely determine the overlapping free time for all participants. This algorithm should take the participant's schedules (blocked times) and the meeting duration as inputs and output a list of available time slots.\n2.  **Constraint Validation Module:** Develop a dedicated constraint validation module. This module should take a proposed time slot, participant schedules, and constraints as input, and output a boolean value indicating whether the time slot is valid. Use this module to verify the proposed solution.\n3.  **Re-Act Loop for Conflict Resolution:** Implement a Re-Act loop specifically for resolving scheduling conflicts. If the constraint validation module detects a conflict, the system should re-reason about the constraints, identify the source of the conflict, and propose a different time slot.\n4.  **Preference Scoring:** Develop a scoring mechanism to evaluate potential solutions based on preferences. For example, give a higher score to time slots that avoid preferred days or times.\n5.  **Few-Shot Examples with Detailed Reasoning:** Add few-shot examples to the prompt that demonstrate step-by-step reasoning for constraint handling and conflict resolution. Include examples with diverse constraints and preferences.\n6.  **Hybrid Approach for Constraint Parsing and Logic:** Use the LLM primarily for information extraction (identifying participants, their schedules, and preferences). Then, use deterministic code (calendar intersection algorithm, constraint validation module) to perform the core constraint satisfaction logic.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample 0:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample 1:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n*   **Sample 4:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

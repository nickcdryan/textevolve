  "approach_summary": "This script employs a multi-agent, LLM-driven approach to meeting scheduling. It uses separate agents for constraint extraction, time slot finding, and solution verification, with chain-of-thought reasoning and embedded examples to guide the LLM. The workflow involves extracting constraints from the input text, finding a potential time slot based on those constraints, and then verifying the proposed solution against the original constraints to ensure its validity.",

      "text_report": "## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system is designed to handle meeting scheduling tasks with multiple participants and constraints, demonstrating a capacity for complex problem-solving.\n2.  The system's architecture aims to follow an expert-like process, starting with problem understanding and moving towards solution generation, which is a sound approach.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system consistently fails at the information extraction stage, indicating a critical weakness in its ability to understand and interpret the problem's parameters. \"Could not extract meeting constraints\" is the near-universal error message.\n2.  The system is unable to handle nuanced constraints (e.g., \"would rather not meet on Wednesday\") or preferences effectively, leading to a failure in constraint handling and solution generation.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The inability to reliably extract key information, such as participants, existing schedules, meeting duration, and constraints, from the problem statement.  The LLM is failing to correctly identify the busy times of the people involved, the duration of the meetings requested, and the soft/hard constraints requested in the text.\n2.  **Constraint Interpretation:** The system struggles to interpret and codify constraints expressed in natural language, especially those involving preferences (soft constraints) or complex temporal logic (e.g., \"not before 14:00\").\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Universal \"Could not extract meeting constraints\" error:** This indicates a fundamental breakdown in the initial parsing/understanding phase. The system isn't even getting to the point of attempting to solve the problem because it cannot correctly obtain the data from the text.\n2.  **Failure to handle preferences:** When there are soft constraints like \"would rather not meet on...\", the system fails to incorporate these preferences into its scheduling logic or even extract that they exist.\n3.  **Temporal Reasoning Issues:** The system struggles with temporal relationships described in text (e.g., \"before 13:00,\" \"after 16:00\"), suggesting a weakness in temporal reasoning and constraint application.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is a failure in **robust information extraction** from the problem description. Specifically, the system struggles to reliably extract participants' schedules (busy slots, meeting duration), including understanding preferences or soft constraints.

Prompt the LLM to extract information related to:\n        *   Participants: A list of all participants.\n        *   Duration: The requested meeting duration (e.g., \"half an hour,\" \"one hour\").\n        *   Schedule:  Each participant's blocked calendar times, as a list of (day, start_time, end_time) tuples.\n        *   Constraints: A list of hard and soft constraints (e.g., \"cannot meet on Monday,\" \"would prefer not to meet before 14:00\").\n    *   **Verification:** Add a verification step where the system re-prompts the LLM to confirm the extracted information.  This would function as a self-check.\n2. **Multi-Agent Approach for Schedule Parsing:**\n    *   **Agent 1: Schedule Extractor:** Responsible for identifying all mentions of time intervals and associating them with the correct participant and day. Prioritize LLM extraction with a clear JSON schema.\n    *   **Agent 2: Constraint Classifier:**  Classifies each constraint as either a hard constraint (must be satisfied) or a soft constraint (preference), and extracts any time-related information.\n    *   **Agent 3: Conflict Resolver:** Handles conflicting or ambiguous time information, using LLM reasoning to determine the correct interpretation based on context.\n\n3. **Explicit Time Reasoning with LLM Chains of Thought:**\n    * Break down time-related constraints into explicit steps, such as:\n        * Parsing the time spans described in the input text.\n        * Converting these time spans into a standard format.\n        * Checking for overlaps between different constraints and time spans.\n        * Validating the consistency and feasibility of the combined time spans.\n    *   Example: \"The constraint 'Stephen can not meet on Monday before 14:00' means Stephen is unavailable from 9:00 to 14:00 on Monday.  We need to add this to Stephen's blocked calendar for Monday.\"\n4. **Use a LLM \"Scheduler Agent\" to Validate Proposed Times**\n    * Give the extracted schedules and constraints to an LLM agent that its sole job is to critique a potential time slot and say whether it is valid or not. Use this to validate a generated answer.\n5. **Ensemble Multiple Extraction Techniques:** Combine different extraction techniques (e.g., targeted LLM prompting, few-shot examples, task-specific fine-tuning) and ensemble the results. This increases the likelihood of correct extraction, even if one technique fails.\n6. **Few-Shot Learning for Constraint Interpretation:** Provide the LLM with several examples of complex constraints and their interpretations to improve its ability to handle nuanced language.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 5:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 6:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 7:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 8:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 9:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 10:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 11:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 12:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 13:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 14:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 15:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 16:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 17:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 18:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 19:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 20:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 21:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 22:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 23:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 24:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  The system is designed to handle meeting scheduling tasks with multiple participants and constraints, demonstrating a capacity for complex problem-solving.\n2.  The system's architecture aims to follow an expert-like process, starting with problem understanding and moving towards solution generation, which is a sound approach.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  The system consistently fails at the information extraction stage, indicating a critical weakness in its ability to understand and interpret the problem's parameters. \"Could not extract meeting constraints\" is the near-universal error message.\n2.  The system is unable to handle nuanced constraints (e.g., \"would rather not meet on Wednesday\") or preferences effectively, leading to a failure in constraint handling and solution generation.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The inability to reliably extract key information, such as participants, existing schedules, meeting duration, and constraints, from the problem statement.  The LLM is failing to correctly identify the busy times of the people involved, the duration of the meetings requested, and the soft/hard constraints requested in the text.\n2.  **Constraint Interpretation:** The system struggles to interpret and codify constraints expressed in natural language, especially those involving preferences (soft constraints) or complex temporal logic (e.g., \"not before 14:00\").\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Universal \"Could not extract meeting constraints\" error:** This indicates a fundamental breakdown in the initial parsing/understanding phase. The system isn't even getting to the point of attempting to solve the problem because it cannot correctly obtain the data from the text.\n2.  **Failure to handle preferences:** When there are soft constraints like \"would rather not meet on...\", the system fails to incorporate these preferences into its scheduling logic or even extract that they exist.\n3.  **Temporal Reasoning Issues:** The system struggles with temporal relationships described in text (e.g., \"before 13:00,\" \"after 16:00\"), suggesting a weakness in temporal reasoning and constraint application.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is a failure in **robust information extraction** from the problem description. Specifically, the system struggles to reliably extract participants' schedules (busy slots, meeting duration), including understanding preferences or soft constraints.

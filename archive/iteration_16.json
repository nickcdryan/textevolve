  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-agent approach with LLMs to schedule meetings by extracting participants and constraints, solving for a suitable time, and verifying the solution. It decomposes the problem into distinct steps handled by specialized LLM agents: `extract_participants`, `extract_constraints`, `solve_meeting_problem`, `verify_solution`, and `is_valid_time` to ensure the scheduling is valid. The overall workflow involves extracting information, finding a solution, and then verifying that the solution is valid. The `call_llm` function is used to query the LLM in each of the specialized functions in the multi-agent system.",

It aggregates busy slots incorrectly.\n2.  **Preference Handling Inconsistencies:**  The system sometimes acknowledges preferences (like \"Charlotte prefers not to meet on Monday\") but then proceeds to suggest meeting times on that day anyway, directly contradicting the given information.\n3. **Limited Day Consideration:** When multiple days are possible (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday), the system often focuses solely on Monday and fails to explore other potentially valid days before concluding there's no solution.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Accurate Availability Calculation across Multiple Participants:** The system's core bottleneck lies in its ability to accurately determine *simultaneous* availability for multiple participants, especially when dealing with overlapping busy schedules. The logic for consolidating busy times and identifying truly free slots is flawed.\n2.  **Consistent Adherence to Preferences and Constraints:** The system demonstrates inconsistency in adhering to explicit preferences and constraints, particularly when those constraints involve a range of options (e.g., days of the week).\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Slot Analysis:** The detailed breakdown of availability often contains errors. For example, stating someone is busy during a specific time when their schedule indicates they are free.\n2.  **Premature Conclusion:** The system frequently gives up searching for a solution too early. It will often analyze one day and conclude no solution exists rather than iterating through all possible days.\n3. **Prioritization Failures:** The system struggles to prioritize hard constraints over soft preferences. It sometimes violates hard constraints (like a person's unavailability) in favor of satisfying preferences.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **INACCURATE AVAILABILITY CALCULATION LEADING TO INCORRECT CONCLUSIONS ABOUT MEETING TIMES**. This stems from flawed logic in how the system aggregates busy schedules and determines simultaneous availability.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling:** Improve the ability to correctly identify and consistently apply all constraints, giving precedence to hard constraints over preferences. Implement a more robust system for tracking and enforcing constraints throughout the reasoning process.\n2.  **Solution Generation:** Enhance the solution generation module to explore all possible days and times before concluding that no solution exists.  Implement iterative search strategies that systematically consider all options.\n3. **Solution Verification:** Implement a strict verification stage that double-checks whether all busy times have been avoided and that the generated schedule does not violate any specified constraints. The verification should flag when an invalid solution has been proposed.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1. **Refactor Availability Calculation:**  Redesign the availability calculation to use a more reliable method, potentially employing a matrix-based approach to represent availability and identify overlapping free slots.  Use Python code to do this calculation to guarantee accuracy.\n2.  **Implement Day Iteration Loop:**  Enclose the availability analysis within a loop that iterates through each possible day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.). Only conclude \"no solution exists\" after all days have been considered.\n3. **Add a Constraint Verification Module:** Create a separate function specifically for verifying a potential solution against all constraints. This function should take a proposed time and the participants' schedules as input and return a boolean value indicating whether the solution is valid.\n4.  **Enforce Preference Logic:**  Modify the system to prioritize constraints effectively. If a preference exists (e.g., \"Charlotte prefers not to meet on Monday\"), the system should only consider Monday meetings if *no other* valid options exist on other days.

It decomposes the problem into rule extraction, rule refinement with verification, and rule application. Agents with roles like \"grid transformation analyst\", \"rule refinement expert\", and \"grid transformation agent\" are used to perform specific subtasks. The functions `rule_extraction` extracts rules, `refine_rule` refines the extracted rules using verification, and `apply_rule` applies the refined rule to the input grid; these are orchestrated in `main` to produce the final transformed grid.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo runtime errors (e.g., JSONDecodeError, TypeError) were detected in the provided error cases. This suggests that the issues are primarily related to logical reasoning and pattern recognition, rather than coding errors.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Correct Code Generation (Success Case):** The system can generate correct and executable code to solve problems involving grid transformations when it understands the underlying pattern (Sample ID 1 in Success Cases).\n*   **Basic Pattern Recognition (Some Cases):** The system demonstrates an attempt to identify patterns in the training examples, which is crucial for solving this type of problem.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of Patterns:** The system frequently misinterprets the patterns presented in the training examples, leading to incorrect transformations of the test input. It struggles to generalize from the training examples to the test input accurately. (Sample ID 0 and 2 in Error Cases)\n*   **Inability to Adapt Grid Dimensions:** The system seems to struggle with changing grid dimensions based on the training examples. (Sample ID 2 in Error Cases)\n*   **Lack of Semantic Understanding:** The \"explanation\" fields in the error cases highlight a critical weakness: the system generates answers that \"do not convey the same information\" or \"do not represent the same information\" as the golden answers. This indicates a lack of semantic understanding of the grid's content and the desired transformations.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The inability to generalize patterns from training examples to the test input is the primary bottleneck. The system seems to memorize aspects of the training examples without understanding the underlying logic.\n*   **Understanding Dimensionality Changes:** The model needs a mechanism to reason about and adapt grid dimensions.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Block Replication:** The system attempts to replicate blocks of numbers, but the replication is often done incorrectly, leading to a completely different arrangement of numbers compared to the golden answer. This may be because the system focuses on replicating *specific values* rather than the *overall structure.*\n*   **Ignoring Border Effects:** In several cases, the transformations involve changes at the borders of regions within the grid. The system struggles to accurately apply these border effects.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inability to accurately abstract and generalize patterns from the training examples to the test input, specifically in the context of grid transformations and dimensionality changes.** The system attempts to mimic patterns but fails to understand the underlying logic or relationships between different elements in the grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Abstraction:** Implement more robust methods for pattern abstraction. This involves identifying the core rules or logic that govern the transformations, rather than simply memorizing specific examples.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Improve the system's spatial reasoning capabilities. This involves understanding the relationships between different regions of the grid and how transformations affect these relationships.\n*   **Handling Variable Grid Sizes:** The system needs to reason about the grid dimensions and correctly adapt to changing dimensions based on the training examples.\n*   **Semantic Understanding of Grid Content:** The system needs to represent not only the numerical values, but also their roles within the overall pattern.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce Abstract Pattern Representation:** Implement a mechanism to represent patterns in a more abstract form, such as using symbolic representations or mathematical formulas to describe the transformations. This would allow the system to generalize patterns more effectively. For instance, instead of just seeing \"replicate 6's in a block,\" the system could represent it as \"replicate the value in the top row, columns 1 and 2, to form a 4xN block\".\n2.  **Implement Spatial Reasoning Module:** Develop a spatial reasoning module that can analyze the relationships between different regions of the grid. This module could use techniques such as convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks to learn spatial features and relationships.\n3.  **Train on More Diverse Data:** Increase the diversity of training examples, including examples with different grid sizes, transformation patterns, and border effects.\n4.  **Implement a Dimension Reasoning Component:** This component will have the task of analyzing how the dimensions of the input grid translate to the output grid, based on the training examples. This can involve simple ratio calculations or more complex reasoning if the dimensional relationship isn't linear.\n5.  **Introduce Intermediate Representation/Explanation:** As the model learns, force it to create a brief explanation of what it is seeing in the images, and what relationships it thinks exist. Then have it evaluate these explanations based on the results of applying them to transformations of training images. This creates an internal \"dialog\" that can refine its understanding.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (Error):**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful, but misinterprets the key features.\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Not applicable.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Fails to generate a correct solution.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Fails to verify the correctness of the solution.\n    *   decision\\_making: Makes an incorrect decision.\n*   **Sample ID 2 (Error):**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful, but fails to extract the dimensionality change.\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Not applicable.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Fails to generate a correct solution.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Fails to verify the correctness of the solution.\n    *   decision\\_making: Makes an incorrect decision.\n",

The model successfully generates correct and executable code to solve problems involving grid transformations when it understands the underlying pattern.\n*   **Sample ID 2 (Error):** The generated grid includes some of the same numbers as the target grid (0, 3, 8), however their layout is incorrect. This demonstrates the model understands the output should contain certain numbers, but cannot figure out how to arrange them. The dimensions of the predicted grid do not match the dimensions of the target grid.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system has a rudimentary ability to recognize and attempt to replicate elements from the training grids into the test grid. However, it struggles significantly with accurately interpreting the underlying patterns, generalizing them to new inputs, and adapting to dimensionality changes. The system demonstrates basic pattern recognition but lacks the spatial reasoning and semantic understanding necessary for complex grid transformations. The system is able to generate correct code, but only when provided simple enough transformations.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system *can* generate functional code in successful cases.\n*   **Element Recognition:** The system identifies some of the elements present in the target grid.\n*   **Basic Pattern Imitation:** The system attempts to replicate numbers and blocks, indicating some level of pattern recognition.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** This is the most critical weakness. The system cannot effectively generalize patterns from the training examples.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:**  The system lacks the ability to understand spatial relationships and apply transformations accordingly.\n*   **Dimensionality Adaptation:**  The system cannot handle changes in grid dimensions based on the training examples.\n*   **Semantic Understanding:**  The system lacks an understanding of what the numbers *represent* and their relationships within the grid.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**.  Without the ability to abstract and generalize patterns, the system will remain limited to memorizing specific examples, which severely limits its ability to solve new problems.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Abstract Pattern Representation:** Focus on how patterns are represented internally. Move away from directly copying numbers and towards abstract representations like symbolic notations or simple mathematical formulas (e.g., \"replicate value A to form a 2x2 block\").\n\n2.  **Develop a Dimension Reasoning Component:** Create a separate module specifically designed to reason about and calculate how grid dimensions change between input and output based on the training examples.  This component should output the predicted dimensions of the output grid.\n\n3.  **Introduce Intermediate Reasoning Prompts:** Modify the prompting strategy to force the model to generate a brief explanation of the perceived pattern *before* generating the code.  This forces the model to verbalize its understanding. Then use this explanation to provide a reward/penalty to the system during training based on the accuracy of the explanation.\n\n4.  **Data Augmentation:**  Increase the diversity of training data. Generate new examples by slightly modifying existing ones (e.g., rotating grids, adding noise, changing numbers slightly).\n\n5.  **Refine Error Feedback Loop:** Carefully analyze the *failed* cases and craft specific, targeted prompts that highlight the errors. For example, \"The output grid should be half the size of the input grid. Please correct your solution.\"\n\n### CAPABILITY MAPPING (Updated)\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (Error):**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Partially successful, misinterprets the pattern's logic.\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Ineffective in applying constraints from training data.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Incorrect output grid generated.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Fails to identify the solution's incorrectness.\n    *   decision\\_making: Incorrect transformation logic applied.\n*   **Sample ID 2 (Error):**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Incomplete; fails to extract dimensionality change.\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Not applicable.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Incorrect output grid generated with wrong dimensions.\n    *   solution\\_verification: Fails to identify dimensional discrepancy.\n    *   decision\\_making: Incorrect scaling/transformation decisions made.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance and error analysis, the capability trend is currently **stable, but low.** The system shows some potential but requires significant improvements in pattern generalization, spatial reasoning, and dimensionality adaptation to become truly effective.

This involves identifying the core rules or logic that govern the transformations, rather than simply memorizing specific examples.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Improve the system's spatial reasoning capabilities. This involves understanding the relationships between different regions of the grid and how transformations affect these relationships.\n*   **Handling Variable Grid Sizes:** The system needs to reason about the grid dimensions and correctly adapt to changing dimensions based on the training examples.\n*   **Semantic Understanding of Grid Content:** The system needs to represent not only the numerical values, but also their roles within the overall pattern.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce Abstract Pattern Representation:** Implement a mechanism to represent patterns in a more abstract form, such as using symbolic representations or mathematical formulas to describe the transformations.

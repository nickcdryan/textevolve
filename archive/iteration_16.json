  "approach_summary": "The script implements a question-answering system using the Gemini LLM and a series of agent roles to decompose the problem. It uses chain-of-thought prompting by sequentially extracting information, generating a search query, retrieving information, extracting the answer, and validating it. The agent roles include information extractor, search query generator, search engine, answer extraction expert, and answer validator.\n\nThe functions used are `call_llm` (interacts with the LLM), `extract_information` (extracts entities and constraints), `generate_search_query` (creates search query), `extract_answer` (extracts answer from search results), `validate_answer` (validates the answer). The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling these functions in sequence to answer a given question. The overall workflow involves processing the question through these stages to arrive at a validated answer.",

The system frequently marks incorrect answers as valid, hindering its ability to identify and correct errors.\n*   **Poor Search Result Comprehension:** The system often fails to extract the correct information from relevant search results, limiting its ability to answer questions accurately.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Incorrect Validation:** The system frequently validates incorrect answers, even when the correct information is available in the search results. This suggests a problem with how the system assesses whether the extracted answer satisfies the question and constraints.\n*   **Difficulty with Comparative Questions:** Questions that require comparing options or considering exceptions (e.g., \"other than\") tend to lead to errors.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is a **deficient answer validation mechanism**. The current validation process seems to rely on superficial matching or lacks the capacity to deeply analyze the extracted answer in relation to the original question and constraints. This leads to false positives, where incorrect answers are deemed correct, preventing the system from engaging in error correction or further refinement.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Answer Validation:** The answer validation process needs significant improvement. It should be more rigorous in checking whether the extracted answer truly satisfies the question and all its constraints.\n*   **Search Result Parsing:** The ability to extract relevant information from search results needs enhancement. This could involve using more sophisticated NLP techniques to understand the context and meaning of the search results.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system needs to better handle complex constraints, including negative constraints and comparative aspects of the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a more robust answer validation module:**\n    *   Use a combination of keyword matching, semantic similarity analysis, and rule-based reasoning to assess the validity of the extracted answer.\n    *   Specifically, when a negative constraint is present, verify that the extracted answer explicitly excludes the specified entity/concept.\n    *   Implement a confidence scoring system that reflects the degree of certainty in the answer's correctness. Lower confidence should trigger further investigation or search attempts.\n2.  **Enhance search result parsing:**\n    *   Utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques to identify key entities and their relationships in the search results.\n    *   Develop a mechanism to rank search results based on their relevance to the question and constraints.\n    *   Consider using a more structured knowledge representation (e.g., a knowledge graph) to store and reason about the information extracted from the search results.\n3.  **Improve constraint handling:**\n    *   Explicitly represent constraints as logical rules or predicates.\n    *   Use these rules to filter and validate potential answers.\n    *   Employ techniques such as abductive reasoning to infer missing information based on the constraints.\n4.  **Add intermediate print statements:** Add the ability to include intermediate outputs and reasoning steps in the output field for future debugging purposes.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** constraint_handling, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 1:** solution_verification, solution_generation, information_extraction\n*   **Sample ID 2:** search result interpretation, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

The search results clearly state Josephine is *exclusively* available to the Inquisitor, yet the system validates the response \"She cannot be romanced by any other character in the game,\" which is the opposite of what the question requires (\"other than the Inquisitor\").\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system identifies awards won by \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\" but fails to determine if those awards are for the animated series category. While the search results mention the animated series category, the system doesn't confirm the extracted awards are in that category.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system deems itself unable to answer the question despite the search results explicitly containing the answer (\"In April 2010, a college in Srinagar was recognized as a \"College for Potential Excellence\" by the University Grants Commission (UGC).\"), and it hallucinates \"Sri Pratap College\" as the correct answer. This demonstrates a failure in identifying the relevant information within the search results and also a failure to correct validation.\n\nThe \"Confidence\" scores attached to the extracted answers are misleading. The high confidence in incorrect answers (10/10 in sample_ids 0,1) indicates a miscalibration in the system's confidence assessment.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates an extremely low capability in question answering, achieving 0% accuracy. Its core weaknesses lie in answer validation, search result comprehension, and constraint handling. While the system can extract entities and generate relevant search queries, it struggles to synthesize this information into accurate and validated answers. The validation mechanism is severely flawed, often marking incorrect answers as correct.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Basic entity recognition is functional.\n*   **Search Query Generation:** Generates generally relevant search queries.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Answer Validation:** Highly unreliable; frequently validates incorrect answers.\n*   **Search Result Comprehension:** Fails to extract relevant information, even when present in the search results.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** Struggles with negative constraints and complex comparative logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Answer Validation**. A reliable validation mechanism is crucial for correcting errors and ensuring accuracy. Without it, improvements in other areas will be undermined.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Overhaul the Answer Validation Module:**\n    *   **Implement a rule-based validation system:** Develop rules to explicitly check if extracted answers satisfy all constraints (positive and negative).\n    *   **Semantic Similarity Analysis:** Use semantic similarity to compare the meaning of the question with the meaning of the extracted answer. This can help detect subtle contradictions.\n    *   **Lower Confidence Threshold:** Drastically reduce the initial confidence score of any extracted answer. Only increase the confidence after rigorous validation checks have passed. Implement a confidence scoring system with categories (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on the number and type of validation checks passed.\n    *   **Introduce a \"Unsure\" Response:** When the confidence score remains below a certain threshold after validation, the system should return a response indicating uncertainty, rather than guessing or providing an incorrect answer.\n2.  **Improve Search Result Parsing (Secondary Focus):**\n    *   **Contextual Understanding:** Train the system to understand the context in which entities appear within search results. This will help differentiate between relevant and irrelevant information.\n    *   **Relevance Ranking:** Implement a mechanism to rank search results based on their relevance to the question *and* its constraints. Consider using a combination of keyword matching, semantic similarity, and information retrieval techniques (e.g., TF-IDF).\n\n3.  **Enhanced Debugging Output:**\n    *   **Intermediate Print Statements:** Add detailed intermediate steps (extracted entities, generated search queries, intermediate validation scores) to improve debugging.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current accuracy of 0% indicates that capabilities are **declining or stagnant**. Without immediate intervention, the system will continue to perform poorly.\n",

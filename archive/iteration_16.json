  "approach_summary": "The script implements a multi-stage question answering system using LLMs, breaking down the problem into analysis, information retrieval, answer generation, and verification. It employs specialized LLM agents for each stage: question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The workflow involves `main` calling `analyze_question` to understand the question, then `extract_relevant_passage` to find relevant text, followed by `generate_answer` to produce an initial answer, and finally `verify_answer` to confirm the solution; each of these functions uses `call_llm` to interface with the Gemini LLM. Other functions used are `call_llm` to interface with the LLM.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: After their first loss of the season, the Steelers traveled to Baltimore to play the Ravens. The Steelers forced a punt on the Ravens' first drive before the Steelers offense produced a 16-play, 84-yard drive which took up 10 minutes and 23 seconds of game time and led to a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal, making the score 3-0. This would remain the score until Boswell added a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter, making the score 6-0. The Steelers finally reached the end zone on their next drive, as Le'Veon Bell scored from the 1-yard line to put the Steelers up 13-0. The Steelers scored again on their final offensive drive of the half as Ben Roethlisberger connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster for an 11-yard touchdown pass (and the Steelers failed their 2-point conversion attempt), putting the Steelers up 19-0 going into halftime. The Ravens' Justin Tucker missed a 62-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter. The Steelers received the ball to begin the second half, and Roethlisberger was intercepted by Eric Weddle, who was credited with the turnover after a coach's challenge by John Harbaugh. The play had initially been ruled a catch by Antonio Brown, but after review, the officials determined that Brown had never established possession of the ball, and because it had never touched the ground, the Ravens took over on the Steelers' 18-yard line. Baltimore capitalized by adding a Tucker 42-yard field goal, making the score 19-3 in favor of the Steelers. On the Steelers' next drive, Boswell missed a 44-yard field goal, and after taking over on downs, the Ravens took only three plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown from Joe Flacco to Mike Wallace. The Ravens attempted a 2-point conversion, but Terrance West (though initially ruled as successfully scoring) was stopped at the 1-yard line by the Steelers defense, making the score 19-9. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers defense intercepted Flacco twice, with the second interception leading to another 1-yard touchdown run by Bell, making the final score 26-9. The Steelers moved into sole possession of first place in the AFC North with the victory while the team improved to 3-1.  The team would win their 6th straight game against a divisional opponent. The victory marked the first time that the Steelers defeated the Ravens in Baltimore since 2012.  It would also be Roethlisberger's first win in Baltimore since 2010. Pittsburgh also scored the most points in Baltimore of any Steelers team since 2002. Seventeen points marked the largest margin of victory for the Steelers in Baltimore in series history, and the largest such margin against any team in Baltimore since the Steelers defeated the Colts in Memorial Stadium by twenty-six points in the 1976 NFL Playoffs.\n\nQUESTION: How many field goals did Chris Boswell kick in the first half?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Titans, the Vikings flew to the Louisiana Superdome for a Week 5 Monday Night duel with the New Orleans Saints. In the game, QB Gus Frerotte was making his first MNF start since 1997 (when he was with the Washington Redskins). In the first quarter, the Vikes trailed early as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. Minnesota would respond with CB Antoine Winfield returning a blocked field goal 59&#160;yards for a touchdown, the first (and longest) ever in franchise history.

In addition to his touchdown off of a blocked field goal, he had 8 tackles and a sack (with a forced fumble recovery).

The Steelers forced a punt on the Ravens' first drive before the Steelers offense produced a 16-play, 84-yard drive which took up 10 minutes and 23 seconds of game time and led to a 30-yard Chris Boswell field goal, making the score 3-0. This would remain the score until Boswell added a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter, making the score 6-0. The Steelers finally reached the end zone on their next drive, as Le'Veon Bell scored from the 1-yard line to put the Steelers up 13-0. The Steelers scored again on their final offensive drive of the half as Ben Roethlisberger connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster for an 11-yard touchdown pass (and the Steelers failed their 2-point conversion attempt), putting the Steelers up 19-0 going into halftime. The Ravens' Justin Tucker missed a 62-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter. The Steelers received the ball to begin the second half, and Roethlisberger was intercepted by Eric Weddle, who was credited with the turnover after a coach's challenge by John Harbaugh. The play had initially been ruled a catch by Antonio Brown, but after review, the officials determined that Brown had never established possession of the ball, and because it had never touched the ground, the Ravens took over on the Steelers' 18-yard line. Baltimore capitalized by adding a Tucker 42-yard field goal, making the score 19-3 in favor of the Steelers. On the Steelers' next drive, Boswell missed a 44-yard field goal, and after taking over on downs, the Ravens took only three plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown from Joe Flacco to Mike Wallace. The Ravens attempted a 2-point conversion, but Terrance West (though initially ruled as successfully scoring) was stopped at the 1-yard line by the Steelers defense, making the score 19-9. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers defense intercepted Flacco twice, with the second interception leading to another 1-yard touchdown run by Bell, making the final score 26-9. The Steelers moved into sole possession of first place in the AFC North with the victory while the team improved to 3-1.  The team would win their 6th straight game against a divisional opponent. The victory marked the first time that the Steelers defeated the Ravens in Baltimore since 2012.  It would also be Roethlisberger's first win in Baltimore since 2010. Pittsburgh also scored the most points in Baltimore of any Steelers team since 2002. Seventeen points marked the largest margin of victory for the Steelers in Baltimore in series history, and the largest such margin against any team in Baltimore since the Steelers defeated the Colts in Memorial Stadium by twenty-six points in the 1976 NFL Playoffs.",

These men were organised into 21 cavalry regiments and 75 infantry battalions, with about 280 modern artillery pieces, organised into 70 batteries, in support. In addition to this, however, in a boost to the army's strength, the Afghan command could call upon the loyalty of up to 80,000 frontier tribesmen and an indeterminate number of deserters from local militia units under British command. In reality, the Afghan regular army was not ready for war. As in past years, the upper levels of the officer corps were riddled with political intrigue.

In the game, QB Gus Frerotte was making his first MNF start since 1997 (when he was with the Washington Redskins). In the first quarter, the Vikes trailed early as Saints QB Drew Brees completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. Minnesota would respond with CB Antoine Winfield returning a blocked field goal 59&#160;yards for a touchdown, the first (and longest) ever in franchise history. New Orleans would answer with kicker Mart&#237;n Gram&#225;tica getting a 35-yard field goal, yet the Vikings replied with kicker Ryan Longwell getting a 53-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Vikes took the lead on a trick play as RB Chester Taylor completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe, along with Longwell kicking a 33-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Saints began to rally as RB Reggie Bush returned a punt 71&#160;yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, New Orleans took the lead with Gram&#225;tica's 53-yard field goal and Bush's 64-yard punt return for a touchdown. Afterwards, Minnesota answered with Frerotte completing a 33-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian, along with Longwell nailing the game-winning 30-yard field goal. Antoine Winfield had a big game. In addition to his touchdown off of a blocked field goal, he had 8 tackles and a sack (with a forced fumble recovery).

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided information.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal the following:\n\n*   **Inconsistent Use of Reasoning Traces:** Only one of the outputs (Success Case Sample ID 1, calculating artillery piece difference) shows a clear reasoning trace (\"The passage states... The difference is...\"). While \"Calculation Needed: true\" is present in other instances, the reasoning leading to the final \"Verification\" answer is often opaque. This makes debugging difficult.\n*   **Arbitrary Formatting:** The formatting of the outputs is inconsistent. Some outputs contain explanatory text, while others only present the final answer.  This inconsistency hinders automated evaluation.\n*   **Discrepancy between \"Calculation Needed\" and Execution:**  Error Case Sample ID 4 (incorrectly counting rushing touchdowns) triggers \"Calculation Needed: true,\" but the system appears to arrive at the incorrect answer without demonstrating the calculation steps.  This suggests a potential disconnect between the *identification* of a calculation requirement and the actual *execution* of that calculation.\n*   **Reliance on Final \"Verification\":** The heavy reliance on the final \"Verification\" output as the sole marker of correctness can be misleading. As seen in Error Case Sample ID 4, the \"Verification\" can be wrong even when relevant information is extracted.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits a mixed bag of capabilities. It demonstrates some competency in information extraction and calculation, but its overall effectiveness is hampered by inconsistencies in reasoning, a lack of transparency, and a critical weakness in accurately counting events based on nuanced understanding.  The raw accuracy score of 0.80 is misleading because it masks underlying issues that significantly limit the system's robustness and reliability.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Identification of Calculation Requirements:** The system often correctly identifies when a calculation is needed (\"Calculation Needed: true\"). This is a crucial first step.\n*   **Basic Information Extraction:** The system can retrieve key information (player names, events) from the text, even if it subsequently misinterprets or misuses that information.\n*   **Performing Simple Arithmetic:**  The system can perform simple arithmetic calculations correctly when it understands the problem and extracts the right data.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Ambiguity in Question Interpretation:**  A major weakness is the system's difficulty in understanding nuanced question intents, particularly those that require filtering or classifying information. It struggles to disambiguate between similar event types.\n*   **Event Counting Errors:** The most critical weakness is the inability to accurately count specific events, especially when those events require specific criteria or filtering. This significantly impacts the system's ability to provide accurate answers to counting-based questions.\n*   **Lack of Transparent Reasoning:** The absence of clear, step-by-step reasoning makes debugging difficult and obscures the source of errors.  The system appears to jump to conclusions without showing its work.\n*   **Inconsistent Use of 'Verification':** The 'Verification' tag does not consistently correlate with correct answers, undermining its value as an indicator of accuracy.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate event counting with nuanced understanding of question intent.** Addressing this weakness will have the greatest impact on the system's overall performance and reliability.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Detailed Reasoning Traces:** Modify the system to *always* provide a step-by-step reasoning trace, regardless of the complexity of the question. This trace should explicitly state:\n    *   The identified calculation requirements\n    *   The extracted relevant information (including specific sentences or phrases from the passage)\n    *   The logical steps taken to arrive at the final answer.\n    *   The final \"Verification\" result.\n\n    Example (for Error Case Sample ID 4, the rushing touchdown question):\n\n    ```\n    ANSWER_START\n    Calculation Needed: true\n    Relevant Passage Text: [Quote relevant sentences about touchdowns]\n    Extracted Touchdown Events: [List of touchdown events with type (rushing/passing)]\n    Filtered Rushing Touchdowns: [List of only rushing touchdown events]\n    Count of Rushing Touchdowns: 1\n    Verification: 1\n    ANSWER_END\n    ```\n\n2.  **Refine Question Parsing with Semantic Role Labeling:** Enhance the question parsing module to incorporate semantic role labeling. This will help the system identify the *roles* of different words and phrases in the question, allowing it to better understand the question's intent.  Focus specifically on identifying constraints and filtering criteria.\n\n3.  **Introduce a Structured Data Representation (Knowledge Graph):**  Experiment with representing the extracted information in a structured format, such as a knowledge graph.  Nodes would represent entities (players, teams, events), and edges would represent relationships (e.g., \"player X scored a rushing touchdown\").  This would facilitate more efficient filtering and counting.\n\n4.  **Develop Explicit Event Classification Rules:**  Create a set of explicit rules for classifying events based on their characteristics.  For example:\n    *   A \"rushing touchdown\" requires the ball carrier to cross the goal line while running.\n    *   A \"passing touchdown\" requires a pass to be caught in the end zone.\n    *   A \"field goal\" requires a successful kick through the uprights.\n\n    These rules should be applied during information extraction.\n\n5.  **Implement a Dedicated Counting Module:** Create a specialized module specifically designed for counting events based on specified criteria. This module should take as input the structured data representation and the question's constraints and output the final count.\n\n6.  **Improve Verification Logic:**  The \"Verification\" step should not just be a final yes/no.  It should include a concise summary of the steps taken to arrive at the answer and a confirmation that all constraints were met.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the analysis, the capabilities are currently **stable with potential for improvement**.  The system demonstrates some fundamental abilities, but its weaknesses are holding it back. The proposed actionable recommendations are designed to unlock significant improvements in accuracy and reliability.\n",

This would allow for easier filtering and counting of specific events.\n3.  **Refined Scoring Rules:** Develop more precise rules for identifying and categorizing scoring events. This can include explicitly defining different types of touchdowns (rushing, passing, etc.) and other scoring events (field goals, safeties, etc.).\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 4:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partial Success (identified touchdown events but did not accurately differentiate types)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (did not correctly apply the constraint of \"rushing\")\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (incorrectly verified the solution as \"2\" instead of \"1\")\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided information.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal the following:\n\n*   **Inconsistent Use of Reasoning Traces:** Only one of the outputs (Success Case Sample ID 1, calculating artillery piece difference) shows a clear reasoning trace (\"The passage states... The difference is...\"). While \"Calculation Needed: true\" is present in other instances, the reasoning leading to the final \"Verification\" answer is often opaque. This makes debugging difficult.\n*   **Arbitrary Formatting:** The formatting of the outputs is inconsistent. Some outputs contain explanatory text, while others only present the final answer.  This inconsistency hinders automated evaluation.\n*   **Discrepancy between \"Calculation Needed\" and Execution:**  Error Case Sample ID 4 (incorrectly counting rushing touchdowns) triggers \"Calculation Needed: true,\" but the system appears to arrive at the incorrect answer without demonstrating the calculation steps.  This suggests a potential disconnect between the *identification* of a calculation requirement and the actual *execution* of that calculation.\n*   **Reliance on Final \"Verification\":** The heavy reliance on the final \"Verification\" output as the sole marker of correctness can be misleading. As seen in Error Case Sample ID 4, the \"Verification\" can be wrong even when relevant information is extracted.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits a mixed bag of capabilities. It demonstrates some competency in information extraction and calculation, but its overall effectiveness is hampered by inconsistencies in reasoning, a lack of transparency, and a critical weakness in accurately counting events based on nuanced understanding.  The raw accuracy score of 0.80 is misleading because it masks underlying issues that significantly limit the system's robustness and reliability.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Identification of Calculation Requirements:** The system often correctly identifies when a calculation is needed (\"Calculation Needed: true\"). This is a crucial first step.\n*   **Basic Information Extraction:** The system can retrieve key information (player names, events) from the text, even if it subsequently misinterprets or misuses that information.\n*   **Performing Simple Arithmetic:**  The system can perform simple arithmetic calculations correctly when it understands the problem and extracts the right data.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Ambiguity in Question Interpretation:**  A major weakness is the system's difficulty in understanding nuanced question intents, particularly those that require filtering or classifying information. It struggles to disambiguate between similar event types.\n*   **Event Counting Errors:** The most critical weakness is the inability to accurately count specific events, especially when those events require specific criteria or filtering. This significantly impacts the system's ability to provide accurate answers to counting-based questions.\n*   **Lack of Transparent Reasoning:** The absence of clear, step-by-step reasoning makes debugging difficult and obscures the source of errors.  The system appears to jump to conclusions without showing its work.\n*   **Inconsistent Use of 'Verification':** The 'Verification' tag does not consistently correlate with correct answers, undermining its value as an indicator of accuracy.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **accurate event counting with nuanced understanding of question intent.** Addressing this weakness will have the greatest impact on the system's overall performance and reliability.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration:\n\n1.  **Implement Detailed Reasoning Traces:** Modify the system to *always* provide a step-by-step reasoning trace, regardless of the complexity of the question. This trace should explicitly state:\n    *   The identified calculation requirements\n    *   The extracted relevant information (including specific sentences or phrases from the passage)\n    *   The logical steps taken to arrive at the final answer.\n    *   The final \"Verification\" result.\n\n    Example (for Error Case Sample ID 4, the rushing touchdown question):\n\n    ```\n    ANSWER_START\n    Calculation Needed: true\n    Relevant Passage Text: [Quote relevant sentences about touchdowns]\n    Extracted Touchdown Events: [List of touchdown events with type (rushing/passing)]\n    Filtered Rushing Touchdowns: [List of only rushing touchdown events]\n    Count of Rushing Touchdowns: 1\n    Verification: 1\n    ANSWER_END\n    ```\n\n2.  **Refine Question Parsing with Semantic Role Labeling:** Enhance the question parsing module to incorporate semantic role labeling. This will help the system identify the *roles* of different words and phrases in the question, allowing it to better understand the question's intent.  Focus specifically on identifying constraints and filtering criteria.\n\n3.  **Introduce a Structured Data Representation (Knowledge Graph):**  Experiment with representing the extracted information in a structured format, such as a knowledge graph.  Nodes would represent entities (players, teams, events), and edges would represent relationships (e.g., \"player X scored a rushing touchdown\").  This would facilitate more efficient filtering and counting.\n\n4.  **Develop Explicit Event Classification Rules:**  Create a set of explicit rules for classifying events based on their characteristics.  For example:\n    *   A \"rushing touchdown\" requires the ball carrier to cross the goal line while running.\n    *   A \"passing touchdown\" requires a pass to be caught in the end zone.\n    *   A \"field goal\" requires a successful kick through the uprights.\n\n    These rules should be applied during information extraction.\n\n5.  **Implement a Dedicated Counting Module:** Create a specialized module specifically designed for counting events based on specified criteria. This module should take as input the structured data representation and the question's constraints and output the final count.\n\n6.  **Improve Verification Logic:**  The \"Verification\" step should not just be a final yes/no.  It should include a concise summary of the steps taken to arrive at the answer and a confirmation that all constraints were met.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the analysis, the capabilities are currently **stable with potential for improvement**.  The system demonstrates some fundamental abilities, but its weaknesses are holding it back. The proposed actionable recommendations are designed to unlock significant improvements in accuracy and reliability.\n"

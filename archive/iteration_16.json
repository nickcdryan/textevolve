The problem is decomposed into three steps: rule extraction, rule application, and result verification. There are three agent roles: a grid transformation expert for rule extraction and application, and a verifier.\n\nThe functions used are:\n- `main`: Serves as the entry point, calling `solve_grid_transformation`.\n- `solve_grid_transformation`: Orchestrates the solution by calling `call_llm` to extract a rule, apply it, and verify the result.\n- `call_llm`:  A simple wrapper that calls the Gemini API, sending a prompt and system instruction, and returning the LLM's text response.\n\nThe workflow involves extracting a transformation rule from example grids, applying this rule to a new input grid, and then verifying the transformed grid's correctness, with `call_llm` being used for each LLM interaction.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError were found in the provided 'output' fields. However, in sample_id 1, a \"Verification failed. Returning fallback grid\" message suggests an internal check within the system failed, leading to a default response. This indicates a potential issue with the solution_verification capability.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Code Generation:** The system is capable of generating Python code to process the input grid and transform it into the desired output grid.\n2.  **Boundary Definition:** The code in sample_id 0 correctly calculates the boundaries for partitioning the input grid into smaller sections that correspond to the output grid cells.\n3.  **Pattern Identification (Partial):** In sample_id 2, the system correctly identifies the pattern of replacing the last two rows based on the first two rows of the input.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Incorrect Pattern Application:** While the system may identify a pattern, it sometimes fails to correctly apply this pattern to the test input (e.g., Sample ID 0 where the values are not correctly placed in the output grid and Sample ID 2 where the reversed order rows replaces the LAST two rows of the entire grid, and in the Golden answer the second to last row has an error).\n2.  **Inconsistent Grid Sizes:** The system struggles when the output grid size changes significantly between training examples and test input, as evidenced by Sample ID 1, which outputs a 3x3 grid when a much larger grid is expected according to the training example. This indicates a failure in information_extraction about grid sizes and solution_generation adapted to new grid sizes.\n3. **Flawed Solution Verification:** When applying a pattern, the system may not be able to fully verifiy if its answer aligns with the requested output. In sample 2 the golden answer itself is flawed.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Robust Pattern Application and Generalization:** The ability to consistently and correctly apply identified patterns to different input grids, including cases where grid sizes or patterns vary from the training examples, is a major bottleneck.\n2. **Solution Verification Logic:** Improved robust solution verification is needed to reduce faulty answer returns, as well as potential errors within golden answers.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Size Mismatch:** The system frequently fails when the size of the input and/or output grids in the test case differ significantly from the training examples.\n2. **Pattern Application Error:** Even when the system identifies the correct pattern, it often misapplies it, leading to incorrect output.\n3. **Lack of Robust Verification:** The presence of fallback mechanisms indicates a weakness in verifying the generated solution's correctness, leading to default or incorrect outputs.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to generalize the identified transformation patterns effectively to unseen input grids, particularly when there are differences in grid dimensions or subtle variations in the transformation logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The system needs to improve its ability to extract relevant information from the problem statement, including input and output grid sizes and relationships between the training examples.\n2.  **Solution Generation:** Enhance the system's capacity to generate solutions that are flexible and adaptable to different grid sizes and transformation patterns, even if they deviate from the training examples.\n3. **Solution Verification:** Implement a more robust solution verification mechanism to catch errors in pattern application and grid formatting, reducing the reliance on fallback mechanisms.\n4. **Constraint Handling**: The system needs a better mechanism for identifying and applying grid dimension constraints properly.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Size Consistency Checks:** Before attempting to apply any transformations, the system should explicitly check if the input and output grid sizes of the test input are consistent with the training examples. If there's a discrepancy, trigger a specific handling routine.\n2.  **Enhance Pattern Application Logic:** Refactor the pattern application logic to be more robust and flexible.

      "text_report": "## Capability Report for AI System\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The code correctly identifies the logic for creating the 3x3 output grid from the 10x10 input grid by checking 3x3 subgrids for non-zero values. However, it only takes the *first* non-zero value encountered, potentially missing other significant values in the subgrid. The resulting output grid, while having the correct dimensions, does not fully represent the distribution of values in the input grid.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The \"Verification failed. Returning fallback grid\" message is a critical indication of a failure. The system failed to generate a valid grid based on the input, resulting in the default grid being returned. This shows an inability to properly adapt to the input and apply the necessary transformations. The failure likely stems from either an inability to extract key information such as the output grid size, or the inability to follow the transformation correctly.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system correctly identifies the pattern of reversing the first two rows and placing them at the end. However, it replaces the *last* two rows instead of applying a potentially more complex logic based on other training examples. Further, the golden answer included in the prompt is flawed, indicating a weakness in the system's ability to verifiy correct solutions.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates basic capabilities in code generation and pattern recognition, but struggles with generalizing patterns, handling varying grid sizes, and robust solution verification. The system is highly susceptible to failing when the test case deviates from the training examples. The lack of error handling and the use of fallback mechanisms highlight a lack of robustness.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can generate runnable Python code to perform grid transformations.\n*   **Basic Pattern Identification:** The system can identify simple patterns and relationships between input and output grids.\n*   **Boundary Definition:** Correctly calculates boundaries between input and output grids in at least one sample.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The system struggles to generalize patterns to new input grids, especially when grid sizes or transformations differ from training examples.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system lacks a robust mechanism for verifying the correctness of generated solutions, leading to fallback mechanisms and potentially incorrect answers.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system fails to properly handle and apply grid dimension constraints.\n*   **Information Extraction:** System doesn't extract and utilize the grid sizes properly in all cases.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary focus should be on improving the **Solution Verification** capability. Even with imperfect pattern identification or application, a robust verification process could prevent the system from returning incorrect or fallback answers. The flawed answer contained within the prompt itself demonstrates the need for the system to be able to verify the correct outputs.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Multi-Stage Verification Process:** Introduce a more thorough verification process including:\n    *   **Syntactic Verification:** Confirm that the generated output adheres to the expected data types and dimensions.\n    *   **Semantic Verification:** Assess if the output grid logically aligns with the recognized transformation pattern and the input grid.\n    *   **Reasonableness Checks:** Implement checks to ensure transformations are sensible, preventing unexpected artifacts or illogical outputs. This might involve comparing statistical properties between input and output grids.\n2.  **Enhance Pattern Application Logic with Validation Steps:**\n    *   Add assertions within the code to validate the intermediate steps of pattern application. For example, before assigning values to the output grid, assert that the indices are within the valid range.\n    *   Implement a rollback mechanism in the pattern application logic. If any assertion fails during pattern application, revert to a previous state or trigger a fallback strategy.\n3.  **Develop Unit Tests for Critical Components:** Create dedicated unit tests for the pattern identification, pattern application, and grid transformation logic. These tests should cover edge cases, various grid sizes, and different transformation patterns.\n4.  **Improve Error Logging:** Augment the code with more informative error logging, including details about the input grids, extracted patterns, and intermediate values. This will help in debugging and identifying the root causes of failures.\n5.  **Explicitly Check and Handle Grid Size Discrepancies:** Implement code to detect size mismatches between training examples and test inputs. Define specific error handling routines for these scenarios.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe current accuracy of 0.00 indicates a **declining** trend if compared to any previous performance. This necessitates immediate attention and the implementation of the recommendations outlined above to improve the system's reliability and accuracy.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nNo explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError were found in the provided 'output' fields. However, in sample_id 1, a \"Verification failed. Returning fallback grid\" message suggests an internal check within the system failed, leading to a default response. This indicates a potential issue with the solution_verification capability.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Code Generation:** The system is capable of generating Python code to process the input grid and transform it into the desired output grid.\n2.  **Boundary Definition:** The code in sample_id 0 correctly calculates the boundaries for partitioning the input grid into smaller sections that correspond to the output grid cells.\n3.  **Pattern Identification (Partial):** In sample_id 2, the system correctly identifies the pattern of replacing the last two rows based on the first two rows of the input.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Incorrect Pattern Application:** While the system may identify a pattern, it sometimes fails to correctly apply this pattern to the test input (e.g., Sample ID 0 where the values are not correctly placed in the output grid and Sample ID 2 where the reversed order rows replaces the LAST two rows of the entire grid, and in the Golden answer the second to last row has an error).\n2.  **Inconsistent Grid Sizes:** The system struggles when the output grid size changes significantly between training examples and test input, as evidenced by Sample ID 1, which outputs a 3x3 grid when a much larger grid is expected according to the training example. This indicates a failure in information_extraction about grid sizes and solution_generation adapted to new grid sizes.\n3. **Flawed Solution Verification:** When applying a pattern, the system may not be able to fully verifiy if its answer aligns with the requested output. In sample 2 the golden answer itself is flawed.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Robust Pattern Application and Generalization:** The ability to consistently and correctly apply identified patterns to different input grids, including cases where grid sizes or patterns vary from the training examples, is a major bottleneck.\n2. **Solution Verification Logic:** Improved robust solution verification is needed to reduce faulty answer returns, as well as potential errors within golden answers.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Size Mismatch:** The system frequently fails when the size of the input and/or output grids in the test case differ significantly from the training examples.\n2. **Pattern Application Error:** Even when the system identifies the correct pattern, it often misapplies it, leading to incorrect output.\n3. **Lack of Robust Verification:** The presence of fallback mechanisms indicates a weakness in verifying the generated solution's correctness, leading to default or incorrect outputs.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to generalize the identified transformation patterns effectively to unseen input grids, particularly when there are differences in grid dimensions or subtle variations in the transformation logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** The system needs to improve its ability to extract relevant information from the problem statement, including input and output grid sizes and relationships between the training examples.\n2.  **Solution Generation:** Enhance the system's capacity to generate solutions that are flexible and adaptable to different grid sizes and transformation patterns, even if they deviate from the training examples.\n3. **Solution Verification:** Implement a more robust solution verification mechanism to catch errors in pattern application and grid formatting, reducing the reliance on fallback mechanisms.\n4. **Constraint Handling**: The system needs a better mechanism for identifying and applying grid dimension constraints properly.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Size Consistency Checks:** Before attempting to apply any transformations, the system should explicitly check if the input and output grid sizes of the test input are consistent with the training examples. If there's a discrepancy, trigger a specific handling routine.\n2.  **Enhance Pattern Application Logic:** Refactor the pattern application logic to be more robust and flexible. Implement checks to ensure that the pattern is being applied correctly based on the identified relationships between training inputs and outputs. Add unit tests that verify the pattern application logic in isolation.\n3.  **Develop a Multi-Stage Verification Process:** Implement a multi-stage verification process that includes:\n    *   **Syntactic Verification:** Check that the generated output grid has the correct dimensions and data types.\n    *   **Semantic Verification:** Check that the generated output grid follows the identified transformation pattern.\n    *   **Reasonableness Check:** Compare the generated output grid to the input grid to ensure that the transformation is \"reasonable\" and does not introduce unexpected artifacts.\n4.  **Implement Dimension Aware Processing:** Ensure code explicitly handles grid dimensions by extracting this information and using it throughout the code to avoid hardcoded dimension assumptions.\n5.  **Augment Training Data**: Provide the model with a richer and more diverse set of training examples to improve its ability to generalize the transformation patterns to unseen inputs.

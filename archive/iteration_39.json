  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM-driven approach with a codebook of transformation patterns and iterative refinement. It decomposes the problem into pattern selection, initial transformation, iterative value adjustment, and result verification. The LLM acts as an expert in identifying patterns and refining cell values, guided by system instructions. The functions `main` serves as the entrypoint, `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process, and `call_llm` interacts with the Gemini model. The overall workflow involves selecting a transformation pattern from the codebook, applying an initial transformation based on the selected pattern, iteratively adjusting cell values based on neighboring values and the selected pattern, and then verifying that the result is a valid grid.",

      "answer": "Based on the transformation pattern described, let's analyze if the provided final transformed grid is valid, given an assumed input grid.\n\nThe pattern consists of:\n\n1.  **Value Replacement:** Mapping 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 to new values based on row position relative to the row of 5's.\n2.  **Row Expansion:** Expanding rows *except* the row of 5's into three rows.\n\nFinal Transformed Grid:\n```\n[\n  [9, 9, 9, 5, 7, 8, 7, 5, 9, 9, 7]\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n  [6, 6, 6, 5, 8, 6, 8, 5, 8, 6, 8]\n  [6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n]\n```\n\nObservations:\n\n*   There's one row of all 5s (the second row), which should be present and unchanged. This condition is met.\n*   Rows above the row of 5's should have come from expanding a row and mapping the original values of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, according to `row_of_fives - i + 5`, and 6,7,8,9 respectively.\n*   Rows below the row of 5's should have come from expanding a row and mapping the original values of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, according to `i - row_of_fives + 5`, and 6,7,8,9 respectively.\n\nLet's assume the input grid was:\n\n```\n[\n  [4, 4, 4, 5, 2, 3, 2, 5, 4, 4, 2],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 3],\n  [1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's apply the logic:\n\n*   **Row 0:** Row of fives is at index 1.\n    *   0 is mapped to `row_of_fives - i + 5 = 1 - 0 + 5 = 6`. Not applicable because input is 4,2,3.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6.  Not applicable because input is 4,2,3.\n    *   2 is mapped to 7. Correct for indices [4,6,10].\n    *   3 is mapped to 8. Correct for index [5].\n    *   4 is mapped to 9. Correct for indices [0,1,2,8,9].\n        Therefore first row can be created from this input.\n*   **Row 2:**\n    *   0 is mapped to `i - row_of_fives + 5 = 2 - 1 + 5 = 6`.  Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6. Correct for indices [0,1,2,5,7,9].\n    *   2 is mapped to 7.  Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n    *   3 is mapped to 8. Correct for indices [4,6,8].\n    *   4 is mapped to 9. Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n        Therefore row 3 can be created from this input.\n*   **Row 3:**\n    *   0 is mapped to `i - row_of_fives + 5 = 3 - 1 + 5 = 7`. Not applicable because input is 1.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6. Correct for all.\n        Therefore row 4 can be created from this input.\n\nGiven the above, we can't reconstruct what the original array input was. But, let's start with rows already having correct values in place (5's)\n\n* Check if 0s mapped to appropriate values given indices relative to 5's.\n* Check if 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s mapped correctly.\n\nSince the mapping rule appears to be followed correctly, but there seems to be a mixture of different value mappings in the same row and there isn't 3 rows of expansions above and below the 5's, the transformed grid is likely INVALID.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Invalid}$",
      "output": "Extracted Pattern Selection: Value Replacement. Parameters: Value mappings and row expansion.\n\nThe core pattern is Value Replacement where the input values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are mapped to other values, BUT the mapping is not fixed and depends on the row location relative to the 5's. The other element is Element Expansion (row wise). The row expansion only happens for rows that are not all 5's.\n\nBased on the training examples, the mapping of values is as follows:\n\n*   Rows *above* the row of 5s:\n    *   0 -> 6 in Example 1; 0 -> 7 in Example 2; 0 -> 8 in Example 3; 0 -> 9 in Example 4. Thus, we can conclude that 0 is mapped to row_index + 6, in relation to the first row that only contains 5's.\n    *   1 -> 6 in Example 1; 1 -> 6 in Example 2; 1 -> 6 in Example 3; 1 -> 6 in Example 4. Thus, 1 is mapped to 6\n    *   2 -> 7 in Example 2; 2 -> 7 in Example 4. Thus, 2 is mapped to 7.\n    *   3 -> 8 in Example 2; 3 -> 8 in Example 4. Thus, 3 is mapped to 8.\n    *   4 -> 9 in Example 3; 4 -> 9 in Example 4. Thus, 4 is mapped to 9.\n\n*   Rows *below* the row of 5s:\n    *   0 -> 6 in Example 1; 0 -> 7 in Example 4; 0 -> 8 in Example 2; 0 -> 9 in Example 3; 0 -> 7.  Thus, we can conclude that 0 is mapped to row_index - rows_of_5 + 6\n    *   1 -> 7 in Example 1; 1 -> 6 in Example 2; 1 -> 6 in Example 3; 1 -> 6 in Example 4; 1 -> 6. Thus, 1 is mapped to 6\n    *   2 -> 7 in Example 1; 2 -> 8 in Example 4. Thus, 2 is mapped to 7.\n    *   3 -> 8 in Example 2; 3 -> 9 in Example 4. Thus, 3 is mapped to 8.\n    *   4 -> 9 in Example 3. Thus, 4 is mapped to 9.\n\nTherefore, a function f(value, row_index, row_of_5_index) needs to be defined to calculate what to change the values to based on the value to be changed, the row_index of the current row, and the index of the row that contains all 5's (the one in the middle).\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    row_of_fives = -1\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        if all(x == 5 for x in input_grid[i]):\n            row_of_fives = i\n            break\n\n    output_grid = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if i < row_of_fives:\n                    new_row.append(i + 6)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(i - row_of_fives + 6)\n\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                new_row.append(6)\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                new_row.append(7)\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                new_row.append(9)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(input_grid[i][j])\n        output_grid.append(new_row)\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n]\ntransformed_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\nfor row in transformed_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\n```\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[6, 7, 6, 5, 6, 8, 6, 5, 6, 9, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 8, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n```\n\nThe previous approach failed.

This condition is met.\n*   Rows above the row of 5's should have come from expanding a row and mapping the original values of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, according to `row_of_fives - i + 5`, and 6,7,8,9 respectively.\n*   Rows below the row of 5's should have come from expanding a row and mapping the original values of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, according to `i - row_of_fives + 5`, and 6,7,8,9 respectively.\n\nLet's assume the input grid was:\n\n```\n[\n  [4, 4, 4, 5, 2, 3, 2, 5, 4, 4, 2],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 3],\n  [1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's apply the logic:\n\n*   **Row 0:** Row of fives is at index 1.\n    *   0 is mapped to `row_of_fives - i + 5 = 1 - 0 + 5 = 6`. Not applicable because input is 4,2,3.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6.  Not applicable because input is 4,2,3.\n    *   2 is mapped to 7. Correct for indices [4,6,10].\n    *   3 is mapped to 8. Correct for index [5].\n    *   4 is mapped to 9. Correct for indices [0,1,2,8,9].\n        Therefore first row can be created from this input.\n*   **Row 2:**\n    *   0 is mapped to `i - row_of_fives + 5 = 2 - 1 + 5 = 6`.  Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6. Correct for indices [0,1,2,5,7,9].\n    *   2 is mapped to 7.  Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n    *   3 is mapped to 8. Correct for indices [4,6,8].\n    *   4 is mapped to 9. Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n        Therefore row 3 can be created from this input.\n*   **Row 3:**\n    *   0 is mapped to `i - row_of_fives + 5 = 3 - 1 + 5 = 7`. Not applicable because input is 1.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6. Correct for all.\n        Therefore row 4 can be created from this input.\n\nGiven the above, we can't reconstruct what the original array input was. But, let's start with rows already having correct values in place (5's)\n\n* Check if 0s mapped to appropriate values given indices relative to 5's.\n* Check if 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s mapped correctly.\n\nSince the mapping rule appears to be followed correctly, but there seems to be a mixture of different value mappings in the same row and there isn't 3 rows of expansions above and below the 5's, the transformed grid is likely INVALID.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Invalid}$\n\nANSWER_END\n",

Not applicable because input is 4,2,3.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6.  Not applicable because input is 4,2,3.\n    *   2 is mapped to 7. Correct for indices [4,6,10].\n    *   3 is mapped to 8. Correct for index [5].\n    *   4 is mapped to 9. Correct for indices [0,1,2,8,9].\n        Therefore first row can be created from this input.\n*   **Row 2:**\n    *   0 is mapped to `i - row_of_fives + 5 = 2 - 1 + 5 = 6`.  Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6. Correct for indices [0,1,2,5,7,9].\n    *   2 is mapped to 7.  Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n    *   3 is mapped to 8.

Thus, 1 is mapped to 6\n    *   2 -> 7 in Example 2; 2 -> 7 in Example 4. Thus, 2 is mapped to 7.\n    *   3 -> 8 in Example 2; 3 -> 8 in Example 4. Thus, 3 is mapped to 8.\n    *   4 -> 9 in Example 3; 4 -> 9 in Example 4. Thus, 4 is mapped to 9.\n\n*   Rows *below* the row of 5s:\n    *   0 -> 6 in Example 1; 0 -> 7 in Example 4; 0 -> 8 in Example 2; 0 -> 9 in Example 3; 0 -> 7.  Thus, we can conclude that 0 is mapped to row_index - rows_of_5 + 6\n    *   1 -> 7 in Example 1; 1 -> 6 in Example 2; 1 -> 6 in Example 3; 1 -> 6 in Example 4; 1 -> 6. Thus, 1 is mapped to 6\n    *   2 -> 7 in Example 1; 2 -> 8 in Example 4. Thus, 2 is mapped to 7.\n    *   3 -> 8 in Example 2; 3 -> 9 in Example 4. Thus, 3 is mapped to 8.\n    *   4 -> 9 in Example 3. Thus, 4 is mapped to 9.\n\nTherefore, a function f(value, row_index, row_of_5_index) needs to be defined to calculate what to change the values to based on the value to be changed, the row_index of the current row, and the index of the row that contains all 5's (the one in the middle).\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    row_of_fives = -1\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        if all(x == 5 for x in input_grid[i]):\n            row_of_fives = i\n            break\n\n    output_grid = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if i < row_of_fives:\n                    new_row.append(i + 6)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(i - row_of_fives + 6)\n\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                new_row.append(6)\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                new_row.append(7)\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                new_row.append(9)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(input_grid[i][j])\n        output_grid.append(new_row)\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n]\ntransformed_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\nfor row in transformed_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\n```\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[6, 7, 6, 5, 6, 8, 6, 5, 6, 9, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 8, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n```\n\nThe previous approach failed. It needs to expand each row into three rows. It also needs to shift the input. This means a single pattern isn't sufficient.\nValue Replacement and Element Expansion is more correct. Element expansion should be row wise (expand each row to three rows)\n\nHere's the correct mapping logic:\n\n1.  **Locate the Row of 5s:** Find the index `row_of_fives` of the row that contains only 5s.\n2.  **Row Expansion:** The output grid has 3 times the number of rows as the input grid (except for the row of all 5's).\n3.  **Value Mapping:**\n\n    *   If the row index `i` is *above* `row_of_fives`:  0 maps to `row_of_fives - i + 5`.\n    *   If the row index `i` is *below* `row_of_fives`: 0 maps to `i - row_of_fives + 5`.\n    * 1 always maps to 6.\n    * 2 always maps to 7.\n    * 3 always maps to 8.\n    * 4 always maps to 9.\n    * 5 remains 5.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    row_of_fives = -1\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        if all(x == 5 for x in input_grid[i]):\n            row_of_fives = i\n            break\n\n    output_grid = []\n    for i in range(rows):\n        if i != row_of_fives:\n            for _ in range(3):  # Expand each row to three rows\n                new_row = []\n                for j in range(cols):\n                    if input_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                        if i < row_of_fives:\n                            new_row.append(row_of_fives - i + 5)\n                        else:\n                            new_row.append(i - row_of_fives + 5)\n                    elif input_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                        new_row.append(6)\n                    elif input_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                        new_row.append(7)\n                    elif input_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                        new_row.append(8)\n                    elif input_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                        new_row.append(9)\n                    else:\n                        new_row.append(input_grid[i][j])\n                output_grid.append(new_row)\n        else:\n            output_grid.append(input_grid[i]) # keep the original row of 5s\n\n    return output_grid\n```\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 3, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n]\ntransformed_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\nfor row in transformed_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\n```\n[9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9]\n[9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9]\n[7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 8, 7, 5, 7, 9, 7]\n[7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 8, 7, 5, 7, 9, 7]\n[7, 7, 7, 5, 7, 8, 7, 5, 7, 9, 7]\n[8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8]\n[8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 8]\n[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[8, 6, 8, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 8, 6]\n[8, 6, 8, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 8, 6]\n[8, 6, 8, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 8, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n[6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6]\n```\n\n```\nSelected Transformation Pattern: Value Replacement.

This condition is met.\n*   Rows above the row of 5's should have come from expanding a row and mapping the original values of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, according to `row_of_fives - i + 5`, and 6,7,8,9 respectively.\n*   Rows below the row of 5's should have come from expanding a row and mapping the original values of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, according to `i - row_of_fives + 5`, and 6,7,8,9 respectively.\n\nLet's assume the input grid was:\n\n```\n[\n  [4, 4, 4, 5, 2, 3, 2, 5, 4, 4, 2],\n  [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n  [1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 3],\n  [1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n```\n\nNow, let's apply the logic:\n\n*   **Row 0:** Row of fives is at index 1.\n    *   0 is mapped to `row_of_fives - i + 5 = 1 - 0 + 5 = 6`. Not applicable because input is 4,2,3.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6.  Not applicable because input is 4,2,3.\n    *   2 is mapped to 7. Correct for indices [4,6,10].\n    *   3 is mapped to 8. Correct for index [5].\n    *   4 is mapped to 9. Correct for indices [0,1,2,8,9].\n        Therefore first row can be created from this input.\n*   **Row 2:**\n    *   0 is mapped to `i - row_of_fives + 5 = 2 - 1 + 5 = 6`.  Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6. Correct for indices [0,1,2,5,7,9].\n    *   2 is mapped to 7.  Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n    *   3 is mapped to 8. Correct for indices [4,6,8].\n    *   4 is mapped to 9. Not applicable because input is 1,3.\n        Therefore row 3 can be created from this input.\n*   **Row 3:**\n    *   0 is mapped to `i - row_of_fives + 5 = 3 - 1 + 5 = 7`. Not applicable because input is 1.\n    *   1 is mapped to 6. Correct for all.\n        Therefore row 4 can be created from this input.\n\nGiven the above, we can't reconstruct what the original array input was. But, let's start with rows already having correct values in place (5's)\n\n* Check if 0s mapped to appropriate values given indices relative to 5's.\n* Check if 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s mapped correctly.\n\nSince the mapping rule appears to be followed correctly, but there seems to be a mixture of different value mappings in the same row and there isn't 3 rows of expansions above and below the 5's, the transformed grid is likely INVALID.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{Invalid}$\n\nANSWER_END\n",

However, the implementation is flawed in several ways:\n    *   It fails to fully implement the row expansion, only generating one row instead of three.\n    *   It misinterprets the mapping logic, not fully capturing the dependence of value replacements on the row's position relative to the \"5\" row. This can be seen from the outputs.\n    *   The system tries to reconstruct the input grid instead of just applying the transformations on the original input to assess validity. This leads to an \"Invalid\" assessment, although the failure is earlier at the transformation stage.\n*   **Sample ID 1 (Incorrect):** The system incorrectly identifies the core pattern as \"Shift and Fill.\" This suggests a failure to grasp the fundamental transformations occurring in the input-output pairs. The code implements a shift and fill operation, but this operation does not lead to the correct output.\n*   **Sample ID 2 (Correct):** The system correctly identified the pattern (Value Replacement with the most frequent value) and implemented it successfully. This highlights the system's ability to handle simpler patterns.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary ability to identify and implement simple patterns in grid transformations. However, it struggles with complex patterns involving multiple transformations, conditional logic, and nuanced relationships between input and output elements. The system's reasoning is often transparent, but the implementation of the identified patterns is inconsistent and prone to errors. The system seems to have difficulty with information extraction from training examples and mapping those rules to solution generation.

This includes:\n\n*   Accurately identifying *all* relevant transformations within a pattern.\n*   Understanding context-dependent transformations (e.g., row position relative to other rows).\n*   Implementing the *entire* pattern, not just partial aspects.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust \"Pattern Verification\" Step:**\n    *   After extracting a pattern, use it to transform the *input* grids from the training examples.\n    *   Compare the result to the corresponding *output* grids.\n    *   If the transformation isn't accurate, flag the pattern as \"unverified\" and trigger a pattern refinement process.

Focus on *what* is being shifted, changed, added, or removed.\n    *   **Implement Detailed Mapping:** Create a more detailed algorithm to map input grid cells to output grid cells. This could involve tracking the movement of specific values or identifying relationships between cell coordinates in the input and output grids.\n    *   **Decompose into Simpler Operations:**  Explore strategies for decomposing complex transformations into a sequence of simpler, more manageable operations.\n3.  **Prioritize Implementation Correctness:**\n    *   **Strict Pattern Adherence:**  Ensure that the generated code *strictly* adheres to the identified pattern.

While the system exhibits some strengths in identifying simple patterns, its inability to handle complex scenarios leads to frequent failures. Without focused improvements, the system risks stagnating or even declining in performance as it encounters increasingly challenging problems.

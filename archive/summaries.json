It decomposes the problem into extracting training examples and test input, highlighting contextual features in the test input using an LLM, and applying targeted modifications based on these features, again using an LLM. Two agent roles are implicitly defined: one for identifying contextual features and another for applying modifications. The functions used are `main` (orchestrates the transformation), `preprocess_question` (extracts training and test data), `highlight_contextual_features` (uses LLM to highlight features), `apply_targeted_modifications` (uses LLM to modify the grid), and `call_llm` (interface with the LLM). The overall workflow involves extracting data, using the LLM to identify features, and then using the LLM to apply modifications to generate the final output.",

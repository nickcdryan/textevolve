It uses separate agents for constraint extraction, time slot finding, and solution verification, with chain-of-thought reasoning and embedded examples to guide the LLM. The workflow involves extracting constraints from the input text, finding a potential time slot based on those constraints, and then verifying the proposed solution against the original constraints to ensure its validity.",

Specifically, the system struggles to reliably extract participants' schedules (busy slots, meeting duration), including understanding preferences or soft constraints.

Finally, the `verify_solution` function with the LLM validates the proposed time against the initial question.\n\nThe workflow consists of `extract_meeting_constraints(question)` to get the data, then `find_available_slots(constraints_json)` to find available slots, then `propose_meeting_time(available_slots)` to propose a meeting time, and finally `verify_solution(question, proposed_time)` to verify the solution with a verification check.

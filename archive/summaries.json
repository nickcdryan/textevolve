The problem is decomposed into three steps: information extraction, time slot selection, and verification, each using a distinct LLM call with few-shot examples. There are no explicit agent roles besides LLM calls, but the system leverages few-shot learning examples to allow the LLM to assume the following roles: scheduling expert, time slot determination expert, and time slot verification expert. The functions used are `call_llm`, `extract_scheduling_information`, `find_best_time_slot`, `verify_time_slot`, `format_answer`, and `main`; where `main` orchestrates the process by calling the other functions sequentially to generate a proposed meeting time.

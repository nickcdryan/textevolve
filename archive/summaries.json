It decomposes the problem into extracting training grids and the input grid, inferring the transformation rule using a \"pattern expert\" agent, applying the rule to the input grid using a \"transformation expert\" agent, and verifying the resulting grid using a \"verification expert\" agent. The `call_llm` function interacts with the Gemini LLM. The `extract_grid` function is used to extract the input grid from the question, and `main` orchestrates the entire process, calling `call_llm` to infer rules, apply transformations, and verify results. The overall workflow involves extracting relevant grids, inferring transformation rules, applying them, and verifying the output to ensure a correct transformation.",

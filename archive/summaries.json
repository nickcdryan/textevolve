The problem is decomposed into extracting meeting details, extracting schedules, and finding available times using example-based prompting and verification steps. It utilizes functions such as `extract_meeting_info` to extract meeting details, `extract_schedules` to extract schedules and verify extractions, `find_available_time` to find available times based on meeting info and schedules, `call_llm` for interfacing with the LLM and the `main` function ties it all together. The overall workflow involves parsing the question, extracting relevant information, and then using the LLM to determine an optimal meeting time.",

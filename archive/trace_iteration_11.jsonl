Though Manu Gin\u00f3bili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. Manu Gin\u00f3bili, who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime.

There were also seven major Axis operations specifically aimed at eliminating all or most Yugoslav Partisan resistance. These major offensives were typically combined efforts by the German Wehrmacht and SS, Italy, Chetniks, the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbian collaborationist government, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The First Anti-Partisan Offensive was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the \"Republic of U\u017eice\", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards Bosnia. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility. After fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailovi\u0107, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs. This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailovi\u0107 advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the U\u017eice attack , but Britain continued to do so. On 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the 1st Proletarian Assault Brigade  - the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the \"Day of the Yugoslav People's Army\".\n\nQUESTION: How many months after Partisans organized sabotage at the General Post Office was Day of the Yugoslav People's Army?"}

The First Anti-Partisan Offensive was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the \"Republic of U\u017eice\", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards Bosnia. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility. After fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailovi\u0107, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs. This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailovi\u0107 advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the U\u017eice attack , but Britain continued to do so. On 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the 1st Proletarian Assault Brigade  - the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the \"Day of the Yugoslav People's Army\".\n\nQUESTION: How many months after Partisans organized sabotage at the General Post Office was Day of the Yugoslav People's Army?\n    Analysis:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert at analyzing questions."}, "output": "```json\n{\n\"type\": \"calculation\",\n\"keywords\": [\"Partisans\", \"sabotage\", \"General Post Office\", \"Day of the Yugoslav People's Army\", \"months\"],\n\"calculation_needed\": \"yes\",\n\"calculation_type\": \"subtraction\"\n}\n```", "status": "success"}

The concurrent Hundred Years' War slowed recovery.  It would be the early 16th century before the population recovered to mid-14th century levels. With an estimated population of 11 million in 1400, 20 million in the 17th century, and 28 million in 1789, until 1795 France was the most populated country in Europe  and the third most populous country in the world, behind only China and India. These demographic changes also led to a massive increase in urban populations, although on the whole France remained a profoundly rural country.  Paris was one of the most populated cities in Europe .  Other major French cities include Lyon, Rouen, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Marseille. These centuries saw several periods of epidemics and crop failures due to wars and climatic change.  Between 1693 and 1694, France lost 6% of its population. In the extremely harsh winter of 1709, France lost 3.5% of its population. In the past 300 years, no period has been so proportionally deadly for the French, both World Wars included.\n\nQUESTION: Which two countries had a larger population than France in 1795?\n    Answer: China and India\n\n    Passage: With an estimated population of 11 million in 1400, 20 million in the 17th century, and 28 million in 1789, until 1795 France was the most populated country in Europe and the third most populous country in the world, behind only China and India.\n\n    Verification:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert at verifying answers and performing calculations to arrive at the right result."}, "output": "China and India\n", "status": "success"}

The Raiders needed a win and a Miami Dolphins loss or a win and a Denver Broncos loss to clinch a playoff berth. Oakland started well, recovering a muffed fumble by Tyreek Hill on a punt following their first drive and setting them up at the Kansas City 38-yard line. However, the Raiders had to settle for a field goal by Sebastian Janikowsi to take the early 3-0 lead. It would be the last lead the Raiders enjoyed on the night. Oakland's offense could muster little for most of the first half including after the Raider defense stopped KC on a fourth and one at the Oakland 27. The Chiefs took the lead early in the second quarter on a 36-yard pass from Alex Smith to Hill to make the score 7-3. After a four-and-out possession for the Raiders, the Chiefs again went down the field scoring on a Charcandrick West three-yard touchdown run. Following another Raiders short offensive possession, Hill returned a punt 78 yards for a touchdown to extend the Chief lead to 21-3. With six minutes remaining in the half, the Raiders went up-tempo and moved the ball down the field capping the drive with a one-yard touchdown run by Latavius Murray with 14 seconds remaining. At the half, the Raiders trailed 21-10. To begin the second half, the Raider defense stepped up intercepting Smith on the second play of the half and giving the offense the ball at the KC 23. However, the offense was shut down by the KC defense and settled for another Janikowski field goal, bringing them within a touchdown of the Chiefs at 21-13. On the next offensive play for the Chiefs, Khalil Mack sacked and stripped Smith of the ball and the Raiders recovered at the KC 18-yard line. The offense again managed little and was forced to settle for a field goal attempt. However, a bad snap resulted in Marquette King being tackled for three-yard loss. Both offenses mustered very little for the remainder of the game. With seven minutes left in the game, the Raiders needed a touchdown to tie and moved down to the KC 19-yard line, but were stopped on fourth down and the Chiefs ran the clock out. Derek Carr struggled mightily with his accuracy on the night, only completing 17 of his 41 pass attempts for 117 yards. He often missed open receivers or badly threw behind receivers. Carr admitted he had a bad night saying, \"Obviously, we didn't do enough.\" The loss ended the Raiders six-game win streak and gave the Chiefs the lead in the division with a 2-0 record over the Raiders. The Raiders, still, in prime playoff position, would have to finish ahead of the Chiefs to win the division.\n\nQUESTION: How many points were scored in the first half?"}

The crusaders captured the Blachernae section of the city in the northwest and used it as a base to attack the rest of the city. While attempting to defend themselves with a wall of fire, however, they burned even more of the city. This second fire left 15,000 people homeless. The crusaders completely took the city on 13 April. The crusaders sacked Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient Greco-Roman and medieval Byzantine works of art were stolen or ruined. Many of the civilian population of the city were killed and their property looted. Despite the threat of excommunication, the crusaders destroyed, defiled and looted the city's churches and monasteries.

Various revolutionary armies carried out the coups. Each was formed by cacos, or peasant militia from the mountains of the north, or who invaded along the porous Dominican border. They were enlisted by rival political factions under the promises of money, which would be paid after a successful revolution, and the opportunity to plunder. The United States was particularly apprehensive about the roles  played by Imperial Germany in the Western hemisphere. Controlling Tortuga, it had intervened in Haiti  and other Caribbean nations at several times during the previous few decades to exert its influence as a rival power. Germany was increasingly hostile to United States domination of the region under its claimed Monroe Doctrine. In the lead-up to the World War I, the strategic importance of the island of Hispaniola, with its manpower, material wealth, and port facilities, was understood by almost all navies operating in the Caribbean, including Germany and the still-neutral United States. Germany had invested in military and intelligence gathering across Hispaniola as part of a wider network of German interest in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 1890s through the 1910s. The United States' concern over Germany's ambitions was mirrored by apprehension and rivalry between American businessmen and the small German community in Haiti, which although numbering only about 200 in 1910 wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. German nationals controlled about 80 percent of the country's international commerce. They owned and operated utilities in Cap-Ha\u00eften and Port-au-Prince, including the main wharf and a tramway in the capital, and also had built the railway serving the Plain of the Cul-de-Sac.\n\nQUESTION: what percent of Hispaniola did the germans own?\n    Answer: 80\n    Passage: German nationals controlled about 80 percent of the country's international commerce.\n\n    Verification:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert at verifying answers and performing calculations to arrive at the right result."}, "output": "The passage states that German nationals controlled about 80 percent of the country's international commerce, not 80 percent of Hispaniola.\n\nVerification: Incorrect\n", "status": "success"}

Initially facing little opposition from the locals, their subsequent ill treatment of the Tr\u00f8ndelag natives, along with tax pressure, laid the groundwork for later resistance to Swedish invasion. Also, Tr\u00f8ndelag was assisted by the governor of Bergenhus, Erik Rosenkrantz, who forced 3500 local peasants to assist him and his 50 professional soldiers. The Swedes saw Bergenhus as their next target. Although the 400 Swedish soldiers were repelled from Tr\u00f8ndelag, Sweden continued to occupy J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen. These provinces were later regained by Denmark-Norway following the peace process in 1570. Sweden also launched attacks towards Eastern Norway. In the south-east Sweden captured B\u00e5hus Fortress, but lost it in 1566. Another part of the army marched through the valley \u00d8sterdalen in 1567, captured Hamar and continued towards Oslo.

The forces were unwilling to launch a counterattack on Swedish land. In 1564 the Swedes marched under Claude Collart and re-occupied Jemtland, as well as Herjedalen and Tr\u00f8ndelag, including the city of Trondheim. Initially facing little opposition from the locals, their subsequent ill treatment of the Tr\u00f8ndelag natives, along with tax pressure, laid the groundwork for later resistance to Swedish invasion. Also, Tr\u00f8ndelag was assisted by the governor of Bergenhus, Erik Rosenkrantz, who forced 3500 local peasants to assist him and his 50 professional soldiers. The Swedes saw Bergenhus as their next target. Although the 400 Swedish soldiers were repelled from Tr\u00f8ndelag, Sweden continued to occupy J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen. These provinces were later regained by Denmark-Norway following the peace process in 1570. Sweden also launched attacks towards Eastern Norway. In the south-east Sweden captured B\u00e5hus Fortress, but lost it in 1566. Another part of the army marched through the valley \u00d8sterdalen in 1567, captured Hamar and continued towards Oslo. They reached as far as the Skiensfjord, and torched Skien at one point. In Oslo, however, citizens torched the city before invaders could seize it. From the south-east, more Swedish forces were then sent to aid in capturing Akershus Fortress near Oslo. These forces torched Konghelle and Sarpsborg on their way. They were repelled from Oslo by local forces together with men belonging to Erik Rosenkrantz and the King of Denmark and Norway.

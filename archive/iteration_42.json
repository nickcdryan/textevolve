  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM in a two-step process: first, it extracts the transformation rule from examples using a chain-of-thought approach (having the LLM explain the rule), and then it applies this rule to a test input. The agent acts as an expert at identifying grid transformation patterns. The script uses `solve_grid_transformation` to orchestrate the rule extraction and application, calling `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API to get the LLM's response. The `main` function simply calls `solve_grid_transformation` function and returns the answer.",

The errors are primarily logic/reasoning-based, where the system produces an incorrect output, rather than crashing. However, the consistently wrong output `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]` suggests a systemic problem, potentially a default response triggered when the system fails to understand the pattern or lacks a proper solution.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** The system attempts to follow the problem statement (\"Transform the test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples.\").\n2.  **Pattern Recognition (Attempted):** The system seems to recognize the need to find a transformation pattern, albeit failing to apply it correctly.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Pattern Understanding and Application:** The system fails to correctly identify and apply the grid transformation patterns from the training examples to the test input. This is the primary cause of the errors.\n2.  **Output Generation:** The system consistently outputs a simple 3x3 matrix of zeros, regardless of the input. This suggests a default or fallback behavior when the system cannot derive a meaningful transformation. This behavior is detrimental, providing a uniformly uninformative answer.\n3.  **Grid Size and Structure Handling:** The system seemingly struggles with handling varying grid sizes and complex data structures. It doesn't maintain the original grid size in its output.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Pattern Induction and Generalization:** The core bottleneck is the system's inability to induce the underlying transformation rules from the provided training examples and generalize them to new input grids. The training examples are complex, and the system fails to extract the relevant features and relationships.\n2. **Adaptive Grid Manipulation:** The system cannot manipulate the input grid according to the learned transformation rules. This includes resizing, shifting elements, and filling in new values based on the observed patterns.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1. **Consistent Incorrect Output:** A recurring pattern is the generation of the `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]` output, regardless of the input grid and training examples. This suggests a failure in understanding the prompt leading to a default output.\n2. **Dimensionality Mismatch:** The golden answers are always 10x10 or larger, while the generated answer is always 3x3, indicating a total failure to grasp the dimensionality of the transformation required.\n3. **Value Misinterpretation:** The system fails to recognize and correctly transform specific values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 8) within the grid.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the system's **failure to learn and apply grid transformation rules from training examples.** This is evident in its inability to produce outputs that resemble the expected transformations, consistently resulting in a default, unrelated matrix.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Pattern Learning:** The system needs a more robust pattern learning mechanism capable of identifying complex transformations within grid structures.\n2. **Grid Manipulation:** The system must be able to manipulate grids according to the learned transformation rules, including resizing, shifting elements, and filling in new values.\n3. **Output Validation:** Add an output validation step to check if the output grid maintains the correct dimensions and contains meaningful values based on the input and training examples.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and capability mapping.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show the same incorrect answer: `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`.  This confirms the error analysis report's suspicion of a default/fallback behavior. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags are correctly used, suggesting the output formatting is working, but the content is entirely wrong. The outputs strongly suggest a systematic problem:\n\n*   **Failure to Process Input:** The model isn't even attempting to analyze the input and training examples.\n*   **Default Response Triggered:** It defaults to a simple 3x3 zero matrix in all cases, meaning the core logic for pattern recognition and transformation isn't functional.\n*   **Lack of Dimensionality Awareness:**  The fixed 3x3 output is independent of the input size and the expected output size, demonstrating a critical flaw.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates almost **no useful capability** for the intended task of grid transformation based on pattern recognition. While it attempts to decompose the problem, it fundamentally fails at pattern understanding, application, and output generation. The consistent incorrect output indicates a broken or non-existent core logic. The problem statement and provided examples are complex, and the system fails to extract the relevant features and relationships within them.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Decomposition (Attempted):** The system *attempts* to follow the problem statement, indicating some level of initial understanding.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system correctly formats the output using \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags.\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Attempted):** There is an attempt to find a transformation pattern.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Understanding and Application:** The *primary* weakness is the complete failure to learn and apply grid transformation rules from training examples.\n*   **Output Generation:**  The consistent generation of a meaningless default output is a major weakness. This default behavior masks any intermediate processing that might be occurring.\n*   **Grid Size and Structure Handling:**  The system demonstrates a complete inability to handle grid sizes and data structures, leading to dimensionality mismatches.\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system is unable to extract relevant information from the given training examples to find the patterns and use them.\n*   **Solution Generation:** The system fails to generate appropriate solutions based on the patterns it is supposed to identify from the given information.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system does not verify its generated solution, which leads to the persistent, incorrect matrix output.\n*   **Decision Making:** The system fails to make appropriate decisions for extracting the right information, generating the correct solution, and verifying it.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Understanding and Application**. The system must be able to correctly identify and apply grid transformation patterns from the training examples to the test input. Without this core capability, the system is essentially useless.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Pattern Learner:**\n    *   Start with a simplified version of the task, perhaps with only 2x2 grids and simple arithmetic transformations (e.g., add 1 to each element).\n    *   Use a simpler algorithm (e.g., rule-based system, basic convolutional layer) to detect these simple patterns.\n    *   Focus on getting this MVP to work *correctly* end-to-end before scaling up.\n2.  **Debug the Default Output Trigger:**\n    *   Identify the exact conditions that trigger the default `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]` output.\n    *   Insert `print` statements before this default output is generated to inspect the state of the variables and the decision-making process.  What checks are failing that lead to this fallback?\n    *   Instead of immediately returning the default output, log an error message indicating why the system failed to find a solution.\n3.  **Enable Intermediate Output Logging:**\n    *   As suggested in the original error analysis, add `print` statements to display the intermediate steps the model is taking:\n        *   Extracted features (if any)\n        *   Hypothesized grid transformation rules (if any)\n        *   Grid manipulation operations (if any)\n        *   Before-and-after states of the grid during transformation\n    *   This will provide invaluable insights into where the system is failing.\n4.  **Focus on Dimensionality Correctness First:**\n    *   Before attempting to learn complex transformations, ensure the system can at least output a grid of the correct size.\n    *   Implement a module to determine the dimensions of the input and training output and use those to initialize the output grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the consistent failure across all samples, the capability trend is **stable, at a near-zero level.** There's no evidence of improvement, and the system is not performing the task correctly. It is crucial to implement the actionable recommendations above to initiate a positive trend.\n",

If the validation fails, a more informative error message should be generated.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Enhance Pattern Learning:**\n    *   Implement a more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithm (e.g., convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks) specifically designed for spatial data.\n    *   Explore techniques like \"attention mechanisms\" to allow the system to focus on relevant parts of the input grid when learning the transformation.\n2.  **Improve Grid Manipulation:**\n    *   Develop a dedicated grid manipulation module that provides functions for resizing, shifting, and filling grid elements.\n    *   Implement error handling within the grid manipulation module to prevent out-of-bounds errors and other common grid-related issues.\n3.  **Implement Output Validation:**\n    *   Add a validation step after generating the output grid to ensure it meets basic criteria, such as having the correct dimensions and containing valid values.\n    *   If the validation fails, log a detailed error message indicating the specific issue (e.g., incorrect dimensions, invalid values).\n4. **Intermediate Output Logging:** Add `print` statements to display the intermediate steps the model is taking, which includes:\n    * Extracted features\n    * Hypothesized grid transformation rules\n    * Grid manipulation operations\n    * Before-and-after states of the grid during transformation\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n**Sample ID: 0**\n*   information_extraction: Failed\n*   solution_generation: Failed\n*   solution_verification: Failed\n*   decision_making: Failed\n\n**Sample ID: 1**\n*   information_extraction: Failed\n*   solution_generation: Failed\n*   solution_verification: Failed\n*   decision_making: Failed\n\n**Sample ID: 2**\n*   information_extraction: Failed\n*   solution_generation: Failed\n*   solution_verification: Failed\n*   decision_making: Failed\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability report for your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and capability mapping.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs consistently show the same incorrect answer: `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`.  This confirms the error analysis report's suspicion of a default/fallback behavior. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags are correctly used, suggesting the output formatting is working, but the content is entirely wrong. The outputs strongly suggest a systematic problem:\n\n*   **Failure to Process Input:** The model isn't even attempting to analyze the input and training examples.\n*   **Default Response Triggered:** It defaults to a simple 3x3 zero matrix in all cases, meaning the core logic for pattern recognition and transformation isn't functional.\n*   **Lack of Dimensionality Awareness:**  The fixed 3x3 output is independent of the input size and the expected output size, demonstrating a critical flaw.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates almost **no useful capability** for the intended task of grid transformation based on pattern recognition. While it attempts to decompose the problem, it fundamentally fails at pattern understanding, application, and output generation. The consistent incorrect output indicates a broken or non-existent core logic. The problem statement and provided examples are complex, and the system fails to extract the relevant features and relationships within them.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Problem Decomposition (Attempted):** The system *attempts* to follow the problem statement, indicating some level of initial understanding.\n*   **Output Formatting:** The system correctly formats the output using \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags.\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Attempted):** There is an attempt to find a transformation pattern.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Understanding and Application:** The *primary* weakness is the complete failure to learn and apply grid transformation rules from training examples.\n*   **Output Generation:**  The consistent generation of a meaningless default output is a major weakness. This default behavior masks any intermediate processing that might be occurring.\n*   **Grid Size and Structure Handling:**  The system demonstrates a complete inability to handle grid sizes and data structures, leading to dimensionality mismatches.\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system is unable to extract relevant information from the given training examples to find the patterns and use them.\n*   **Solution Generation:** The system fails to generate appropriate solutions based on the patterns it is supposed to identify from the given information.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system does not verify its generated solution, which leads to the persistent, incorrect matrix output.\n*   **Decision Making:** The system fails to make appropriate decisions for extracting the right information, generating the correct solution, and verifying it.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Understanding and Application**. The system must be able to correctly identify and apply grid transformation patterns from the training examples to the test input. Without this core capability, the system is essentially useless.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Pattern Learner:**\n    *   Start with a simplified version of the task, perhaps with only 2x2 grids and simple arithmetic transformations (e.g., add 1 to each element).\n    *   Use a simpler algorithm (e.g., rule-based system, basic convolutional layer) to detect these simple patterns.\n    *   Focus on getting this MVP to work *correctly* end-to-end before scaling up.\n2.  **Debug the Default Output Trigger:**\n    *   Identify the exact conditions that trigger the default `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]` output.\n    *   Insert `print` statements before this default output is generated to inspect the state of the variables and the decision-making process.  What checks are failing that lead to this fallback?\n    *   Instead of immediately returning the default output, log an error message indicating why the system failed to find a solution.\n3.  **Enable Intermediate Output Logging:**\n    *   As suggested in the original error analysis, add `print` statements to display the intermediate steps the model is taking:\n        *   Extracted features (if any)\n        *   Hypothesized grid transformation rules (if any)\n        *   Grid manipulation operations (if any)\n        *   Before-and-after states of the grid during transformation\n    *   This will provide invaluable insights into where the system is failing.\n4.  **Focus on Dimensionality Correctness First:**\n    *   Before attempting to learn complex transformations, ensure the system can at least output a grid of the correct size.\n    *   Implement a module to determine the dimensions of the input and training output and use those to initialize the output grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the consistent failure across all samples, the capability trend is **stable, at a near-zero level.** There's no evidence of improvement, and the system is not performing the task correctly. It is crucial to implement the actionable recommendations above to initiate a positive trend.\n"

Using Analogy-Based Reasoning: Transform the grid not just by pattern matching, but by analogy to existing examples.\n2. Dynamic Example Selection: Select the most relevant training examples to use as \"analogies\" for the given test input.\n3. Focus on Structural Similarity: Prioritize structural characteristics of the grid (size, density, etc.) to guide example selection.\n4. Apply a similarity weighting between the top analogies, and apply the weighted transformation\n\"\"\"\n\nimport os\nimport re\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional, Union\n\ndef call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):\n    \"\"\"Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response.

  "approach_summary": "This script uses an analogy-based reasoning approach with dynamic example selection to transform a grid. The problem is decomposed into three main steps: selecting relevant training examples, applying analogy-based transformation, and verifying the transformation. Three agent roles are involved: an example selector, a grid transformer, and a verification agent. The `call_llm` function interfaces with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves calling `select_relevant_examples` to get relevant examples, then `analogy_based_transformation` to transform the grid, and finally `verify_transformation` to ensure the transformation is correct.",

The error manifests as an incorrect transformation resulting in the AI explicitly stating \"Transformation incorrect.

This points to a robust error-checking mechanism, even if the transformation logic itself is faulty.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Transformation Logic:** The core transformation logic is failing consistently, leading to the \"Transformation incorrect\" message. The system is unable to correctly extrapolate the transformation pattern from training examples to the test input.\n2.  **Lack of Specificity:** The error message \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" is vague. It doesn't provide any specific information about *why* the transformation failed. This makes debugging and improvement challenging.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition and Extrapolation:** The system struggles to identify and apply the correct transformation rule from the provided training examples. This is the fundamental bottleneck.\n2.  **Debugging Information:** The error message is not informative. Providing more detailed debug information about the system's reasoning would greatly aid in identifying and fixing the root cause.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe consistent \"Transformation incorrect. Check the training examples\" message indicates a systematic failure in the core transformation logic. The system is likely failing to generalize from the training examples. It's possible that the system is attempting to directly apply rules learned from the training examples without identifying the underlying pattern.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the system's **inability to correctly identify and extrapolate the transformation pattern from the training examples**. This is evident in all error cases where the system recognizes the transformation is incorrect but cannot produce the correct output.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** The pattern recognition algorithm needs significant improvement. The system needs a more robust method to discern transformation patterns from limited training data.\n2.  **Debugging Output:** Implement more detailed debugging outputs. The system should provide information about the transformation rules it *thinks* it has learned, the features it is looking at, and why it rejected the initial transformation.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a feature extraction step:** Before applying the transformation, explicitly extract features from the input grid and training examples. Examples of features include relative positions of elements, recurring patterns, or element frequencies.\n2.  **Develop a rule-based system:** Create a rule-based system that attempts to derive the underlying transformation logic from the extracted features. For example, \"if element X is surrounded by elements Y, replace X with Z\".\n3.  **Implement a pattern matching algorithm:** Employ a pattern matching algorithm (e.g., sequence alignment, graph matching) to directly compare the input grid with the training examples to find similar patterns.\n4.  **Augment Training Data:** If possible, increase the number of training examples to provide the system with a wider range of patterns.\n5.  **Detailed Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to capture the system's reasoning steps, extracted features, and applied rules. This will significantly aid in debugging and identifying the source of errors.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Likely failed to extract the relevant pattern from the training examples.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a correct solution based on the extracted pattern.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Likely failed to extract the relevant pattern from the training examples.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a correct solution based on the extracted pattern.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Likely failed to extract the relevant pattern from the training examples.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a correct solution based on the extracted pattern.\n",

This indicates a systemic issue in the transformation logic itself, rather than intermittent errors. The consistency of this message across all samples suggests a robust error-checking mechanism, but the system's inability to perform the transformation correctly renders this mechanism ineffective. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" tags are correctly used, showing the system is adhering to the output format, but the content within these tags is consistently incorrect. The system never attempts to provide an actual answer, always defaulting to the error message.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system, in its current state, has very limited capability. While it demonstrates an ability to *detect* errors in its transformation process, it consistently *fails* to perform the transformation accurately. Its error detection mechanism is commendable, but the core transformation logic is fundamentally flawed. The system lacks the ability to generalize patterns from training data to new inputs.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Error Detection:** The system reliably identifies incorrect transformations and avoids providing potentially wrong answers without flagging them.

The system needs to learn to actually *solve* the problem, not just recognize that it *cannot* solve the problem.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Feature Extraction:** Before attempting any transformation, add a dedicated feature extraction step. This step should identify and isolate relevant features from both the input grid and the training examples. Focus on features relevant to the problem domain (e.g., relative positions, element frequencies, patterns). Document the choice of extracted features and their impact on performance.\n\n2.  **Develop a Pattern Matching Algorithm:** Integrate a pattern-matching algorithm (e.g., sequence alignment, graph matching) to compare the input grid with the training examples. Prioritize pattern-matching techniques suitable for grid-based transformations.\n\n3.  **Enhance Debugging Output:** Modify the error message to include more specific information about the system's reasoning process. At a minimum, the debugging output should include:\n    *   The features the system identified.\n    *   The transformation rules the system *attempted* to apply.\n    *   Why the system rejected the initial transformation.\n    Example improved error message: \"Transformation incorrect. Identified features: [feature1, feature2]. Attempted rule: IF feature1 THEN transform X to Y.

Consider adding more diverse and complex examples. If the training data is insufficient in variety or amount, even a perfect algorithm won't be able to generalize.\n\n5. **Implement Detailed Logging:** Enable comprehensive logging to track the system's internal states during execution, including extracted features, attempted rules, intermediate results, and error conditions. This will facilitate debugging and analysis of the root causes of failures.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable (at a low level)**.

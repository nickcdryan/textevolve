  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM in a two-step process: rule extraction and rule application. It first prompts the LLM to explain the transformation rule based on input examples, then prompts the LLM again to apply this extracted rule to a test grid, using a chain-of-thought approach. The LLM acts as a pattern recognition expert, and the script validates the LLM's generated grid.\n\nThe main functions used are `main`, `solve_grid_transformation`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function calls `solve_grid_transformation` which orchestrates the LLM calls using `call_llm` with specialized prompts for rule extraction and application, including validation. The overall workflow involves prompting the LLM for a rule explanation, then using that explanation in a subsequent prompt to generate the transformed grid, followed by validation to ensure the output is a valid grid.",

This will enable more effective debugging and identification of error sources.\n\n5.  **Focus Training Data on Constraint Diversity:** Provide training examples that showcase a wider variety of constraints and patterns. This will force the system to learn more general rules instead of overfitting to specific examples.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable but unsatisfactory**. While the system demonstrates potential, its low accuracy indicates that the current approach is not effective. Focused improvements are necessary to drive progress. With proper implementation of the recommendations, it should become **improving**.\n"

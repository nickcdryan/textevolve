  "approach_summary": "The script employs a multi-stage LLM approach, decomposing the problem into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification, using chain-of-thought prompting with examples. It uses a single agent role, with the LLM acting as an expert in question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and verification. The functions `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer` sequentially refine the response using the LLM, with `call_llm` acting as the interface to the Gemini model. The overall workflow involves analyzing the question, extracting a relevant passage, generating an initial answer, and then verifying/correcting that answer, with error handling at each stage.",

      "original_passage": " The Indianapolis Colts began their 2011 season at Reliant Stadium against the Houston Texans.  For the first time since the 1998 season, Peyton Manning was not under the helm at quarterback and it was recently acquired Kerry Collins that would take his position.  The game started very well for the Colts, opening up with an interception by Melvin Bullitt that allowed the Colts to take control.  However, a three and out from the offense quickly gave the Texans the ball to drive down and score a field goal and take a 3-0 lead.  Collins and the Colts offense was out of sync for much of the first quarter, fumbling two snaps and giving Houston the great field position inside of the Indianapolis 40-yard line.  After the first quarter, the Texans held a commanding 17-0 lead and were firing on all cylinders.  The second quarter continued Houston's dominance, with all three teams of the Colts failing to stop or to execute against the Texans.  At halftime, the Colts trailed Houston 34-0, the largest deficit in the entire 58-year history of the franchise.  The second half saw little action with both teams taking shorter drives and in some senses, running down the clock.  The Colts scored their first and the only points scored in the second half with a Reggie Wayne touchdown from Collins in the fourth quarter.  The Colts went on to lose to the Texans 34-7, their second straight season starting 0-1.",

In the first quarter, Indianapolis took the lead as kicker Adam Vinatieri got a 23-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Chargers took the lead as kicker Nate Kaeding made a 35-yard field goal, while QB Philip Rivers completed a 39-yard TD pass to WR Vincent Jackson.  The Colts would tie the game as QB Peyton Manning completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Anthony Gonzalez. In the third quarter, Indianapolis took the lead as Manning completed a 1-yard TD pass to RB Dominic Rhodes.  In the fourth quarter, the Colts added onto their lead as Vinatieri got a 38-yard field goal.  San Diego cut the Colts' lead to 3 as Rivers completed a 1-yard TD pass to FB Jacob Hester, and then Kaeding kicked a 47-yard field goal to tie the game.  However, Indianapolis sealed the deal as Vinatieri nailed the game-winning 51-yard field goal.

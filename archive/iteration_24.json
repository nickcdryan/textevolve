  "approach_summary": "The script implements a QA system using two simulated knowledge bases (KB1 and KB2) and LLM-driven answer extraction and validation, using the `gemini-2.0-flash` model. The problem is decomposed into knowledge retrieval, answer extraction, and answer validation, with KB1 having higher authority in cases of conflict. The agent roles involved are a knowledge base simulator, an answer extractor, and a validator.\n\nThe functions used are:\n1.  `call_llm`: Used to interface with the LLM for all tasks.\n2.  `simulate_knowledge_base`: Simulates retrieving information from two knowledge bases, KB1 and KB2.\n3.  `extract_answer`: Extracts the answer from the knowledge base results, giving precedence to KB1.\n4.  `validate_answer`: Validates the extracted answer against the knowledge bases, also prioritizing KB1.\n5.  `main`: Orchestrates the entire QA process.\n\nThe workflow starts with `main` calling `simulate_knowledge_base` twice to get results from KB1 and KB2, then calls `extract_answer` to extract an answer from these results, and then uses `validate_answer` to validate the extracted answer.",

The successful cases show that it can extract numerical values and contextual information like units.\n*   **Ability to extract additional information:** The model is able to extract additional information, and when that information is correct, it is counted as a success.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Information Extraction:** The system sometimes extracts the wrong information or focuses on irrelevant details, leading to incorrect answers. Specifically, in the error case, it selects the wrong name for the spouse.\n*   **Fact Verification:** The system's ability to verify the accuracy of the information it retrieves seems limited. It doesn't seem to have a robust mechanism to confirm whether the retrieved information is actually the correct answer to the question.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Accurate Information Extraction and Verification:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to consistently and accurately extract the correct information from the knowledge source and verify that it is, in fact, the answer to the question. The error case highlights the fact retrieval issue, where the model incorrectly identified the spouse of Silas A. Holcomb.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misidentification of Key Entities:** The error case demonstrates a recurring pattern of misidentifying key entities (e.g., spouse, date, location) within the question and retrieving incorrect or irrelevant information.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **inaccurate fact retrieval.** The system retrieves and presents information that is factually incorrect with respect to the question asked. This is evidenced by the incorrect spouse name in the error case.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Improve the accuracy of identifying and extracting the correct entities and relationships relevant to the question.\n*   **Fact Verification:** Implement a fact verification mechanism to validate the extracted information against reliable sources. This could involve cross-referencing multiple sources or using a knowledge base to confirm the accuracy of the extracted data.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Improve the system's understanding of question context to filter irrelevant information and focus on the core question being asked.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Fact Verification Module:** Design a module that cross-references the extracted information with multiple knowledge sources or a reliable knowledge base to verify its accuracy before presenting it as the answer.\n2.  **Enhance Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Relationship Extraction:** Train the NER model to not only identify entities but also to understand the relationships between them. This will help the system to accurately identify the spouse of a specific person.\n3.  **Implement a Confidence Scoring Mechanism:** Assign confidence scores to the extracted information based on the reliability of the source and the consistency across multiple sources. This will help the system prioritize more reliable information and potentially flag uncertain answers for further review.\n4.

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and requested sections.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.67 (2/3)\n*   Error samples: 1/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:**\n\n(As provided in the original prompt - focusing on key takeaways below)\n\n*   **Primary Issue:** Inaccurate fact retrieval.\n*   **Critical Bottleneck:** Inability to consistently and accurately extract the correct information from the knowledge source and verify its accuracy.\n*   **Error Patterns:** Misidentification of key entities (e.g., spouse, date, location).\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample outputs show a pattern:\n\n*   **Structure:** The outputs consistently adhere to the \"ANSWER\\_START ... ANSWER\\_END\" format. This is good for parsing and extraction downstream.\n*   **Content Variability:**  The content *within* the start/end markers varies significantly. One is a numerical frequency (\"500 Hz\"), another a name (\"Laura Everett Holcomb\"), and the last a description (\"The oral arms of the female\"). This suggests the system *can* handle different data types, but the error analysis indicates it struggles with *correctly* linking these types to the question asked.\n*   **Potential Source of Error:** The \"Laura Everett Holcomb\" output is *likely* the error case cited in the error analysis. It highlights the issue of incorrect information extraction, specifically misidentifying the spouse.  The execution analysis confirms that the system *does* extract *something*, but it's the wrong something.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic ability to retrieve information based on a question. It can format the output correctly. However, its core capability \u2013 extracting *accurate* and *relevant* information to answer the question \u2013 is unreliable. The system lacks a robust fact-checking or contextual understanding mechanism, making it prone to errors even when retrieving seemingly related information.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:**  Consistent and parsable output format (\"ANSWER\\_START ... ANSWER\\_END\").\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Able to retrieve *some* information based on the question.  The ability to extract additional information is valuable, if correct.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Fact Retrieval:** The system frequently extracts and presents factually incorrect information. This is the most damaging weakness.\n*   **Lack of Fact Verification:** The system doesn't validate the accuracy of retrieved information against reliable sources.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Limited understanding of the nuanced relationships between entities mentioned in the question. This leads to entity misidentification.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most critical capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Fact Retrieval**. Without this, all other capabilities are undermined.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Fact Verification:**  Modify the system to *actively* verify retrieved information. This *must* be implemented for the next iteration.\n    *   **Specific Action:** After extracting a potential answer, query a separate, trusted knowledge base (e.g., Wikidata, a curated database) to confirm the extracted facts.  If the information can't be verified with high confidence, flag the answer as uncertain or provide an alternative.  This is the *most important* step.\n    *   **Technical Detail:** Use a library like `sparqlwrapper` (Python) to query Wikidata for fact verification. The queries should be constructed dynamically based on the extracted entities and relationships.  For example, if the system extracts \"Laura Everett Holcomb\" as the spouse, the verification step should query Wikidata to confirm that \"Silas A. Holcomb\" is indeed married to \"Laura Everett Holcomb\".\n2.  **Enhance Relationship Extraction during NER:**  Improve the Named Entity Recognition (NER) component to not just identify entities but also extract the *relationships* between them.\n    *   **Specific Action:**  Fine-tune the NER model on a dataset that includes relationship annotations.  This will train the model to explicitly identify relationships like \"spouse_of,\" \"born_in,\" etc.  This requires annotated data.\n    *   **Technical Detail:** Use a library like `spaCy` or `transformers` and fine-tune a pre-trained model on a dataset that includes entity and relationship annotations.\n3.  **Debug Intermediate Steps with Print Statements:** As suggested in the original error analysis, add detailed logging to trace the system's reasoning process.\n    *   **Specific Action:**  Insert `print()` statements at critical stages of the information retrieval and reasoning pipeline.  Log the following:\n        *   The raw question being processed.\n        *   The entities identified by the NER.\n        *   The queries being made to the knowledge source.\n        *   The raw results returned by the knowledge source.\n        *   The final answer selected and the reasoning behind the selection.\n    *   **Technical Detail:**  Use Python's `logging` module to capture these prints in a structured way for easier analysis.

The successful cases show that it can extract numerical values and contextual information like units.\n*   **Ability to extract additional information:** The model is able to extract additional information, and when that information is correct, it is counted as a success.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Information Extraction:** The system sometimes extracts the wrong information or focuses on irrelevant details, leading to incorrect answers. Specifically, in the error case, it selects the wrong name for the spouse.\n*   **Fact Verification:** The system's ability to verify the accuracy of the information it retrieves seems limited. It doesn't seem to have a robust mechanism to confirm whether the retrieved information is actually the correct answer to the question.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Accurate Information Extraction and Verification:** The primary bottleneck is the system's inability to consistently and accurately extract the correct information from the knowledge source and verify that it is, in fact, the answer to the question. The error case highlights the fact retrieval issue, where the model incorrectly identified the spouse of Silas A. Holcomb.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misidentification of Key Entities:** The error case demonstrates a recurring pattern of misidentifying key entities (e.g., spouse, date, location) within the question and retrieving incorrect or irrelevant information.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **inaccurate fact retrieval.** The system retrieves and presents information that is factually incorrect with respect to the question asked. This is evidenced by the incorrect spouse name in the error case.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Information Extraction:** Improve the accuracy of identifying and extracting the correct entities and relationships relevant to the question.\n*   **Fact Verification:** Implement a fact verification mechanism to validate the extracted information against reliable sources. This could involve cross-referencing multiple sources or using a knowledge base to confirm the accuracy of the extracted data.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Improve the system's understanding of question context to filter irrelevant information and focus on the core question being asked.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Fact Verification Module:** Design a module that cross-references the extracted information with multiple knowledge sources or a reliable knowledge base to verify its accuracy before presenting it as the answer.\n2.  **Enhance Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Relationship Extraction:** Train the NER model to not only identify entities but also to understand the relationships between them. This will help the system to accurately identify the spouse of a specific person.\n3.  **Implement a Confidence Scoring Mechanism:** Assign confidence scores to the extracted information based on the reliability of the source and the consistency across multiple sources. This will help the system prioritize more reliable information and potentially flag uncertain answers for further review.\n4. Add print statements to your program to determine the intermediate steps of retrieval and reasoning to see exactly where the model went wrong in choosing the incorrect spouse.\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID: 1**\n\n*   information_extraction: Failed (incorrectly identified the spouse)\n*   solution_verification: Failed (did not verify the accuracy of the extracted information)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and requested sections.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.67 (2/3)\n*   Error samples: 1/3\n\n**ERROR ANALYSIS REPORT:**\n\n(As provided in the original prompt - focusing on key takeaways below)\n\n*   **Primary Issue:** Inaccurate fact retrieval.\n*   **Critical Bottleneck:** Inability to consistently and accurately extract the correct information from the knowledge source and verify its accuracy.\n*   **Error Patterns:** Misidentification of key entities (e.g., spouse, date, location).\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample outputs show a pattern:\n\n*   **Structure:** The outputs consistently adhere to the \"ANSWER\\_START ... ANSWER\\_END\" format. This is good for parsing and extraction downstream.\n*   **Content Variability:**  The content *within* the start/end markers varies significantly. One is a numerical frequency (\"500 Hz\"), another a name (\"Laura Everett Holcomb\"), and the last a description (\"The oral arms of the female\"). This suggests the system *can* handle different data types, but the error analysis indicates it struggles with *correctly* linking these types to the question asked.\n*   **Potential Source of Error:** The \"Laura Everett Holcomb\" output is *likely* the error case cited in the error analysis. It highlights the issue of incorrect information extraction, specifically misidentifying the spouse.  The execution analysis confirms that the system *does* extract *something*, but it's the wrong something.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic ability to retrieve information based on a question. It can format the output correctly. However, its core capability \u2013 extracting *accurate* and *relevant* information to answer the question \u2013 is unreliable. The system lacks a robust fact-checking or contextual understanding mechanism, making it prone to errors even when retrieving seemingly related information.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Formatting:**  Consistent and parsable output format (\"ANSWER\\_START ... ANSWER\\_END\").\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Able to retrieve *some* information based on the question.  The ability to extract additional information is valuable, if correct.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Fact Retrieval:** The system frequently extracts and presents factually incorrect information. This is the most damaging weakness.\n*   **Lack of Fact Verification:** The system doesn't validate the accuracy of retrieved information against reliable sources.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** Limited understanding of the nuanced relationships between entities mentioned in the question. This leads to entity misidentification.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most critical capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Fact Retrieval**. Without this, all other capabilities are undermined.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Fact Verification:**  Modify the system to *actively* verify retrieved information. This *must* be implemented for the next iteration.\n    *   **Specific Action:** After extracting a potential answer, query a separate, trusted knowledge base (e.g., Wikidata, a curated database) to confirm the extracted facts.  If the information can't be verified with high confidence, flag the answer as uncertain or provide an alternative.  This is the *most important* step.\n    *   **Technical Detail:** Use a library like `sparqlwrapper` (Python) to query Wikidata for fact verification. The queries should be constructed dynamically based on the extracted entities and relationships.  For example, if the system extracts \"Laura Everett Holcomb\" as the spouse, the verification step should query Wikidata to confirm that \"Silas A. Holcomb\" is indeed married to \"Laura Everett Holcomb\".\n2.  **Enhance Relationship Extraction during NER:**  Improve the Named Entity Recognition (NER) component to not just identify entities but also extract the *relationships* between them.\n    *   **Specific Action:**  Fine-tune the NER model on a dataset that includes relationship annotations.  This will train the model to explicitly identify relationships like \"spouse_of,\" \"born_in,\" etc.  This requires annotated data.\n    *   **Technical Detail:** Use a library like `spaCy` or `transformers` and fine-tune a pre-trained model on a dataset that includes entity and relationship annotations.\n3.  **Debug Intermediate Steps with Print Statements:** As suggested in the original error analysis, add detailed logging to trace the system's reasoning process.\n    *   **Specific Action:**  Insert `print()` statements at critical stages of the information retrieval and reasoning pipeline.  Log the following:\n        *   The raw question being processed.\n        *   The entities identified by the NER.\n        *   The queries being made to the knowledge source.\n        *   The raw results returned by the knowledge source.\n        *   The final answer selected and the reasoning behind the selection.\n    *   **Technical Detail:**  Use Python's `logging` module to capture these prints in a structured way for easier analysis. This will help pinpoint the exact step where the error occurs (e.g., incorrect query, faulty parsing of results, etc.).\n4.  **Implement Confidence Scoring:** Assign a confidence score to each extracted fact based on source reliability and consistency. This will let you filter more confidently.\n    *   **Specific Action:** When extracting information from different sources, assign a trust factor for each source (ex: a curated database would have a higher trust factor than a generic web page). Aggregate this trust factor for each extracted fact to generate a confidence score,\n5.  **Evaluate Different Prompts and Retrieval Strategies:** The system's retrieval could be improved by optimizing prompts and queries.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Test different prompts and retrieval strategies on the same set of questions and evaluate them.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy (0.67), the capabilities are currently **Stable, but concerningly low**. The core issue of inaccurate fact retrieval needs to be addressed immediately; otherwise, the system's value will be severely limited. Implementing the actionable recommendations above should result in an **Improving** trend in the next iteration. However, without these changes, the system risks being deemed unreliable and, therefore, its capabilities could be considered to be on a **Declining** trend.\n"

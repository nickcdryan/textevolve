  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to schedule meetings by extracting information and then proposing a meeting time. The problem is decomposed into two main stages: extracting meeting details and scheduling the meeting, each leveraging LLMs with specialized instructions. The `extract_meeting_info` function extracts participants, duration, days, and schedules using an LLM, followed by a verification step to ensure accuracy; the `schedule_meeting` function proposes a time based on the extracted information and question, again followed by a verification step. The overall workflow involves `main` calling `extract_meeting_info` to extract details and then calling `schedule_meeting` to propose a meeting time, with `call_llm` handling the interaction with the Gemini API throughout the process.",

This is a clear pattern and reinforces the \"Bias Towards Selecting Monday\" weakness.\n*   **Incorrect Reasoning:** The third output provides a \"Reasoning\" section, which is valuable. However, even here, the reasoning is flawed. It attempts to justify the Monday choice but shows incorrect calculations of available times, as pointed out in the initial error analysis. The length of the reasoning also varies, which indicates inconsistency.\n*   **Lack of Preference Adherence:** There is no explicit mention or demonstration of adhering to preferences in these sample outputs.\n*   **Inconsistent output format**: \"Reasoning\" is not present in all executions. The standard answer format \"Here is the proposed time: Monday, 9:00-9:30\" is fine as a starting point.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system has a *rudimentary* capability to schedule meetings. It can identify participants and time slots, but its *primary capability is compromised* by its *inability to accurately calculate availability* and its biases. The system struggles with even relatively simple scheduling scenarios. It is currently unreliable.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempt at Reasoning:** The system *attempts* to reason about participant availability. This is a good foundation to build upon, but the reasoning needs to be drastically improved in accuracy and logic.\n*   **Constraint Identification:** The system *attempts* to identify and incorporate constraints (schedules, preferences).\n*   **Somewhat consistent output format:** Can generate answers in a specific format.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Availability Calculation (CRITICAL):** The system *consistently fails* to accurately calculate availability based on provided schedules. *This is the core problem.*\n*   **Preference Handling (CRITICAL):** The system *frequently ignores* stated preferences.\n*   **Reasoning Accuracy (CRITICAL):** Reasoning is incorrect and untrustworthy.\n*   **Monday Bias (Significant):** This bias actively hinders the system's ability to find optimal solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Accurate Availability Calculation.** Without this, the entire system is fundamentally flawed. All other improvements depend on reliable availability data.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Deterministic Availability Calculation (IMMEDIATE PRIORITY):**\n    *   *Completely replace the current LLM-driven availability calculation with a deterministic, code-based solution.* This *must* be done in Python, using appropriate data structures (e.g., lists of time intervals, datetime objects) to represent blocked and available times.\n    *   Create a dedicated function that takes participant schedules (in a defined format) as input and returns a list of *mutually available* time slots.\n    *   Implement unit tests for this function to ensure its correctness and reliability. Test edge cases (e.g., completely overlapping schedules, no available time, schedules spanning multiple days).\n2.  **Introduce Input Validation and Structured Data Formatting:**\n    *   Develop a function to validate the input format. Ensure the input data (schedules, preferences) adheres to a clearly defined structure. This allows deterministic code to work effectively.\n    *   Convert input data (schedules, preferences) into structured data formats before sending it to the reasoning process.\n3.  **Prompting Refinement (Second Priority):**\n    *   Once the deterministic availability calculation is in place, refine the prompting strategy to *focus on preference handling* and *explainability*.\n    *   Instruct the LLM to explicitly justify its solution by referencing the *calculated* availability and the stated preferences.\n    *   Add examples to the prompt demonstrating how to prioritize preferences and resolve conflicting constraints *given correct availability data*.\n4.  **LLM Solution Verification (Third Priority):**\n    *   Create a separate LLM-powered \"Solution Verification Agent.\" Its sole purpose is to verify that a proposed solution adheres to all schedules and preferences, *given the already calculated availability*.\n    *   This agent should receive the proposed solution, the calculated availability data, and the participant preferences as input.\n    *   The agent should output a clear \"Valid\" or \"Invalid\" verdict, along with a detailed explanation if the solution is invalid.\n5.  **Remove Monday bias from Prompt:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to consider all possible days for scheduling and not to have a preference for any specific day.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently **declining.** The system provides potentially harmful solutions based on misinformation. However, there is potential for *significant improvement* if the above recommendations are followed, starting with the availability calculation.\n",

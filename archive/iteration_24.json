  "approach_summary": "This script solves grid transformation problems by using an LLM to identify patterns and complete grids. It decomposes the problem into identifying key locations and context numbers within the grid using the `identify_locations_and_context` function, and then performing grid completion using the `perform_grid_completion` function. The LLM acts as an expert in pattern recognition and grid completion, and is prompted to perform these tasks. Other functions include `solve_grid_transformation` which orchestrates the solution, and `call_llm` which is a utility function that calls the Gemini API. The workflow starts with `solve_grid_transformation` calling `identify_locations_and_context` to find the template and `perform_grid_completion` to solve the grid, and each of these functions uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the LLM.",

The system consistently generates incorrect outputs, primarily due to JSON formatting errors and failure to extrapolate complex patterns, leading to the failure to properly transform input grids.\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal the following key issues:\n\n*   **JSON Formatting Errors:** The system consistently fails to produce valid JSON. The generated JSON strings often include \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END\" tags, unnecessary newlines, and inconsistent use of quotation marks around numbers. This makes the output unparsable and prevents proper evaluation.\n*   **Incorrect Grid Dimensions:** The output grids often have incorrect dimensions compared to the expected output. For example, one output is a single-dimensional array instead of a two-dimensional grid, and in another, there are the wrong number of columns and rows.\n*   **Random Value Application:** When the system does generate a grid, the values placed within the grid often seem arbitrary and unrelated to the transformation patterns demonstrated in the training examples. The values are not based on constraint handling of the example input and output grids.\n*   **String vs Number Confusion:** There seems to be confusion about whether grid values should be strings or numbers, leading to inconsistent data types within the JSON output.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates limited capabilities:\n\n*   **Weaknesses:** The system struggles with JSON formatting, complex pattern recognition, dimension matching, value application, and constraint application.\n*   **Strengths:** The system demonstrates basic pattern recognition and transformation, but its inability to apply these skills correctly renders them ineffective.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Basic Pattern Recognition:** The system shows potential in recognizing basic patterns from training examples, although it fails to apply them effectively. Retain and build on this potential by providing more structured training data and feedback.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **JSON Formatting:** The most critical weakness is the consistent failure to generate valid JSON output. This prevents proper evaluation and integration of the system.\n*   **Pattern Extrapolation and Application:** The system fails to extrapolate complex patterns from training examples and apply them accurately to test inputs. This limits its ability to solve grid transformation tasks effectively.\n*   **Value assignment:** The system does not assign the correct values to the output.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary focus should be on **improving JSON output formatting** to produce consistently valid JSON, and the secondary focus should be on improving **pattern extrapolation and value application**, as invalid JSON prevents evaluating transformation ability.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement JSON Validation and Sanitization:** Add a post-processing step that validates the generated JSON and sanitizes it to remove any extraneous characters, tags, or formatting issues. Ensure that the output is a valid JSON representation of the grid.\n2.  **Enforce Correct Data Types:** Ensure that grid values are consistently represented as either numbers or strings, based on the training data. Avoid mixing data types within the same grid.\n3.  **Implement Dimension Matching:** Implement a dimension checker that compares the dimensions of the predicted output grid to the dimensions of the output grids in the training examples. If the dimensions do not match, adjust the output grid accordingly.\n4.  **Implement Step-by-Step Reasoning with Print Statements:** Add print statements to each step of the process, allowing for easier debugging and understanding of the system's decision-making process.\n5.  **Refine Training Data and Examples:** Re-evaluate training data to ensure it is clear and representative of the desired output. Provide both positive and negative examples to help the system understand what is expected.\n6.  **Refine Constraint handling:** Ensure that the system understands the constraints present in the test input grid and the training example grids.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level.** Immediate and focused intervention is needed to address the critical weaknesses and initiate improvement.

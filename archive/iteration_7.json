  "approach_summary": "The script uses a rule generation and application approach, where the LLM first generates a transformation rule from training examples and then applies it to the test input. The problem is decomposed into two main steps: rule generation and rule application, each with its own verification step. Two agent roles are implicitly defined: one for generating transformation rules and another for applying them. Other functions include `verify_rule_format` and `verify_grid_format` for result validation, and `call_llm` for LLM interaction. The workflow involves calling `generate_transformation_rule` to obtain a rule, then calling `apply_transformation_rule` to transform the grid, with verifications after each step.",

    "error_analysis": {
      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThe primary runtime error observed across all error cases is: \"Output should start with '[[' and end with ']]'.\" This indicates a failure in the formatting of the final output. The system is likely not generating a valid Python list of lists, or the output is being wrapped in other characters before the final transformation, causing it to fail the validity check.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to identify specific strengths, as there are no successful cases. However, some potential strengths that might exist but are not evident from the errors include:\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** The system attempts multiple transformations, suggesting an underlying structure to tackle the grid transformation tasks.\n2.  **Error Handling (Partial):** The system recognizes a failure and reports an error message, indicating some error detection capability.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Output Formatting:** The system consistently fails to format the final output correctly, resulting in the prevalent \"Output should start with '[[' and end with ']]'\" error.\n2.  **Transformation Logic:** The failure to generate the correct transformed grid across all examples points to a weakness in the core transformation algorithm or reasoning process.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to identify and apply the transformation patterns evident in the training examples.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Output Formatting:** The incorrect output format prevents successful completion, even if the internal logic is partially correct.\n2.  **Core Transformation Algorithm:** The algorithm at the heart of the transformation process is flawed, leading to incorrect grid generation.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe consistent \"Output should start with '[[' and end with ']]'\" error indicates a systematic problem with how the final output is constructed. This is likely a coding error related to string manipulation or data structure conversion. The repeated failure despite multiple attempts suggests the problem is not simply random, but due to a misunderstanding or misimplementation of the required output format.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem to fix is the **incorrect output formatting**, which consistently leads to transformation failures.

The system attempts the transformation multiple times (3), indicating a retry mechanism, but fails each time for the same reason. The error message \"Output should start with '[[' and end with ']]'\" confirms that the system isn't producing output in the expected format. The \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggest a well-defined output structure, but the system is failing to adhere to it regarding the core grid transformation result.  The retry mechanism does not appear to address the underlying issue, leading to repeated failures. The consistent error message across all attempts and all samples strongly suggests a systemic issue rather than a random error.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the AI system demonstrates extremely limited capability in performing the grid transformation task. Its accuracy is 0%, and it consistently fails due to output formatting errors. While it exhibits some basic error handling and a retry mechanism, these are insufficient to overcome the fundamental problems with output generation and transformation logic.  The system seems to struggle with bridging the gap between internal data representation (presumably a list of lists) and the required output string format.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Retry Mechanism:** The system attempts the transformation multiple times.

This function should be thoroughly tested with various grid sizes and values. This function should be well-documented and isolated.\n2.  **Add Intermediate Print Statements:** Insert print statements to display the transformed grid *before* it's passed to the formatting function. This will help determine if the transformation logic is producing the correct data structure. Include information on the *type* of data being printed (e.g., `print(type(grid))`, `print(type(grid[0]))`).\n3.  **Test the Formatting Function Independently:** Create a unit test specifically for the output formatting function. This test should cover various scenarios, including empty grids, small grids, and large grids.\n4.  **Refactor Code for Modularity:** Separate the transformation logic into smaller, more manageable functions. This will improve code readability and make it easier to debug.\n5.  **Improve Retry Logic:** If retries are kept, modify the retry mechanism to not simply repeat the same failing approach. Ideally, the retry mechanism should log debugging information (e.g., the state of the grid) on the first failure.\n6.  **Introduce Assertions:** Use assertions to check the intermediate state of the data at various points during processing.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThe primary runtime error observed across all error cases is: \"Output should start with '[[' and end with ']]'.\" This indicates a failure in the formatting of the final output. The system is likely not generating a valid Python list of lists, or the output is being wrapped in other characters before the final transformation, causing it to fail the validity check.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nBased on the provided information, it's difficult to identify specific strengths, as there are no successful cases. However, some potential strengths that might exist but are not evident from the errors include:\n\n1.  **Problem Decomposition:** The system attempts multiple transformations, suggesting an underlying structure to tackle the grid transformation tasks.\n2.  **Error Handling (Partial):** The system recognizes a failure and reports an error message, indicating some error detection capability.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Output Formatting:** The system consistently fails to format the final output correctly, resulting in the prevalent \"Output should start with '[[' and end with ']]'\" error.\n2.  **Transformation Logic:** The failure to generate the correct transformed grid across all examples points to a weakness in the core transformation algorithm or reasoning process.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to identify and apply the transformation patterns evident in the training examples.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Output Formatting:** The incorrect output format prevents successful completion, even if the internal logic is partially correct.\n2.  **Core Transformation Algorithm:** The algorithm at the heart of the transformation process is flawed, leading to incorrect grid generation.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe consistent \"Output should start with '[[' and end with ']]'\" error indicates a systematic problem with how the final output is constructed. This is likely a coding error related to string manipulation or data structure conversion. The repeated failure despite multiple attempts suggests the problem is not simply random, but due to a misunderstanding or misimplementation of the required output format.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem to fix is the **incorrect output formatting**, which consistently leads to transformation failures. This issue masks any potential progress made by the transformation logic itself. The system needs to reliably generate a valid Python list of lists wrapped inside `[[ ]]`.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Output Formatting:** Implement a robust and reliable method to format the transformed grid as a valid Python list of lists string.\n2.  **Transformation Logic:** Re-evaluate and refine the core transformation algorithm based on a clearer understanding of the patterns in training examples.\n3.  **Pattern Understanding**: Improve how the system learns and generalizes patterns from training examples.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Explicit Output Formatting Function:** Create a dedicated function to convert the transformed grid (a Python list of lists) into a string with the required `[[ ]]` format.

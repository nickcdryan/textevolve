Given training examples\n    and a test input, transform the test input according to the learned pattern. Focus on spatial relationships.\n    The output should be a transformed grid, formatted as a list of lists.\n    Here are multiple examples of grid transformations that showcase step-by-step transformation reasoning.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7]]\n    Reasoning: The input is expanded. 0 becomes [0,0,0]. 7 becomes [7,7]. Each row is similarly repeated, expanding the grid.\n    Output Grid:\n    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]]\n\n    Example 2:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0]]\n    Reasoning: The input grid is expanded following a specific pattern. Each '4' becomes '[4,0,4]', and each '0' becomes '[0,0,0]'. The same expansion logic occurs from columns to rows.\n    Output Grid:\n    [[4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\n    Example 3:\n    Input Grid:\n    [[0, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [0, 0, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0], [9, 0, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]]\n    Reasoning: 1 is kept and is converted to [0, 8, 8]. The rest of the numbers become [0,0,0] or [8,0,0] based on 9s and 0s. The pattern appears to occur such that only 1 numbers are kept from each grid and the rest of the locations in the grid become 0 or 8.\n    Output Grid:\n    [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,8,8],[0,0,0]]\n    \n\n    Given the training examples and the TEST INPUT below, transform the TEST INPUT according to the patterns observed in the examples. \n    Be sure to output the grid in a list of lists structure.\n    {question}\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Call the LLM\n    llm_output = call_llm(prompt)\n\n    # Implement very basic validation: Check for list of lists structure\n    if \"Error\" in llm_output:\n        return \"Error occurred during processing.\"\n    elif not('[' in llm_output and ']' in llm_output): # rudamentary validation.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses the Gemini LLM for solving grid transformation problems through direct pattern matching, enhanced by few-shot examples within a detailed prompt. The problem is decomposed by framing it as a pattern recognition task, where the LLM acts as a pattern expert. The `call_llm` function sends prompts to the Gemini model, and the `solve_grid_transformation` function constructs the prompt with examples and calls the LLM. `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation` to get the answer. The overall workflow involves creating a detailed prompt with examples, sending it to the LLM, and returning the LLM's generated grid transformation.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your requirements.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**OVERALL PERFORMANCE:**  The system's performance is extremely poor, with 0% accuracy. While it demonstrates some pattern recognition abilities at a high level, it consistently fails to translate these observations into correct and generalized code. The iterative refinement attempts are largely ineffective, leading to increasingly complex but still incorrect solutions.\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   The system identifies the pattern of changing 0s to 2s near 1s. However, the initial code only considers left and up neighbors.\n    *   The system attempts to add a loop for \"propagation,\" but this doesn't fundamentally address the logic errors.\n    *   Later attempts add diagonal checks, further complicating the code and still failing to achieve the desired result.\n    *   The system appears to get stuck in a loop of adding increasingly complex conditions without truly understanding the underlying logic. The final code contains redundant checks.  The system does not understand that the propagation should be outwards until the edge of the shape.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   The system recognizes the \"cross\" pattern but generates code that fills the entire rows and columns with the non-zero value, rather than creating a cross originating from the location. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of how to translate spatial reasoning to code.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   The system completely fails to generalize and hardcodes a static grid as the output. This represents a significant failure in understanding the task's requirement for a *transformation* of the input. The system reduces the grid size significantly and uses the value \"3\" to signify the row size. This shows a lack of robust information extraction.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a fragile understanding of pattern recognition and an even weaker ability to translate those patterns into working code.  It can identify high-level relationships but fails to implement them correctly. The debugging and refinement process is largely ad-hoc and lacks a systematic approach. There is also a significant issue with generalization and overfitting to specific examples. The system does not appear to learn from previous failures in a meaningful way.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **High-Level Pattern Recognition:** The system can often identify the general type of pattern present in the input examples (e.g., identifying the \"cross\" pattern in Sample ID 1, the presence of '2's around the '1's in Sample ID 0).\n*   **Code Generation Attempt:** The system attempts to generate and execute Python code to solve the problem, which is a positive sign.\n*   **Iterative Refinement:** The system attempts to iteratively refine its solution based on perceived errors, even though these refinements are not effective.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Code Generation Accuracy:** The inability to reliably translate observed patterns into correct and efficient code.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The system struggles to translate spatial relationships (e.g., \"adjacent to,\" \"above,\" \"diagonal\") into code.\n*   **Generalization:** The system's inability to extract general rules from training examples and avoids overfitting to specific instances.\n*   **Debugging and Error Analysis:** The debugging process is unsystematic and relies on flawed assumptions.\n*   **Understanding of Iterative Processes:** The system does not handle iterative processes well, such as how a change in one cell can affect other cells in subsequent iterations.\n*    **Information Extraction:** Lack of robust information extraction to properly perform transformations of grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Code Generation Accuracy**. Without improvements here, all other capabilities are severely limited. Focus on getting the initial code generation step to produce more accurate and reliable implementations of the identified patterns.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Unit Tests for Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Create a suite of unit tests for common spatial relationships (adjacent, above, below, diagonal). These tests should verify that the code correctly identifies cells based on these relationships.  For example, write unit tests to verify that a function correctly identifies all cells adjacent to a given cell.\n    *   Example: `assert get_adjacent_cells(grid, 2, 3) == [(1, 3), (3, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4)]`\n2.  **Introduce a Code Debugger with Intermediate Output:**\n    *   Integrate a code debugger that allows the system to step through the generated code and inspect variable values at each step.\n    *   Include the printing of intermediate grid states during execution to visualize the transformation process. This would help the system understand how the code is modifying the grid.\n3.  **Enhance Spatial Reasoning with a Specialized Library (Consider Exploration):**\n    *   Investigate using a spatial reasoning library or framework to represent and reason about spatial information. This could provide more robust and accurate spatial calculations. *Note: This is a more exploratory suggestion, as the overhead of integrating a new library needs to be weighed against the potential benefits.*\n4.  **Implement Pattern Decomposition and Code Generation in Stages:**\n    *   Break down the pattern recognition and code generation process into smaller, more manageable steps.\n    *   First, focus on accurately identifying the core pattern.\n    *   Second, generate code for each sub-pattern.\n    *   Third, combine the resulting code to form a complete solution.\n5.  **Implement Constraints to Prevent Hardcoded Solutions:**\n    *   Add a check to ensure that the generated code is actually operating on the input grid and transforming it in some way.\n    *   If the output is a static value, throw an error and force the system to try a different approach.\n6.   **Implement Checks for Grid Size Variations:**\n    *   Add checks to determine if the input and output grids have different sizes.\n    *   If the output grid changes size, determine if it is within the constraints of the prompt.\n7.  **Review Code for Common Errors Before Execution:**\n    *   Before executing the code, have the system review it for common errors, such as incorrect loop conditions, off-by-one errors, incorrect indexing, and hardcoded values. This could involve using a static analysis tool or implementing custom checks.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level.** There is no evidence of improvement and some evidence of getting further from a correct solution with each iteration due to the addition of complexity. The system needs fundamental improvements in code generation and debugging to show any meaningful progress.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nThere are no identified runtime errors in the provided error cases.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n*   The system can often correctly identify the high-level pattern in the training examples (e.g., identifying the \"cross\" pattern in sample\\_id 1, the \"2\" changing the surrounding 0's pattern in sample\\_id 0).\n*   The system attempts to generate and execute Python code to solve the problem.\n*   The system attempts to iteratively refine its solution based on perceived errors.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n*   The system struggles to translate high-level pattern descriptions into correct code implementations. In sample\\_id 1, while it identifies the \"cross\" pattern, the generated code fails to implement it correctly.\n*   The system has difficulty in extracting key information from examples, and instead, creates a static grid as its answer (as is the case with sample\\_id 2) instead of producing a generalized pattern.\n*   The iterative refinement process is often ineffective because the system struggles to pinpoint the exact source of the error in its previous attempts. It often resorts to adding unnecessary complexity (e.g., adding diagonal checks in sample\\_id 0) instead of fixing the fundamental logic.\n*   The system lacks the ability to understand the \"propagation\" process to allow for the correct logic implementation with `2`s in sample\\_id 0.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Code Generation Accuracy:** The inability to reliably translate observed patterns into correct and efficient code is the most significant bottleneck. This leads to solutions that are either incomplete or simply wrong.\n*   **Debugging and Refinement:** The debugging process is unsystematic and relies on flawed assumptions, hindering the ability to correct the code and can also cause the generated solution to be more convoluted than necessary.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Incorrect Implementation of Spatial Relationships:** The system frequently fails to accurately translate spatial relationships (e.g., \"adjacent to,\" \"above,\" \"diagonal\") into code. This is evident in sample\\_id 0 where the '2' transformation logic is flawed.\n*   **Misunderstanding of \"Propagation\" or Iteration:** The system does not handle iterative processes well, such as how a change in one cell can affect other cells in subsequent iterations. The initial attempts to propagate the 2's horizontally/vertically failed to create a general solution.\n*   **Overfitting to Specific Examples:** There's a tendency to focus on individual examples rather than extracting a general rule. In sample\\_id 2, the \"solution\" is simply returning a static grid.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe most critical problem is the inaccurate translation of pattern recognition and spatial relationships into executable code. The generated code often fails to reflect the observed patterns correctly, leading to incorrect outputs.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Code Generation:** Improve the accuracy and reliability of the code generation process. This requires a better understanding of spatial relationships and a more robust mapping from patterns to code.\n*   **Debugging and Error Analysis:** Implement a more systematic debugging process. This might involve adding print statements, intermediate outputs, or even a step-by-step code debugger.\n*   **Generalization:** Improve the system's ability to extract general rules from training examples rather than overfitting to specific instances.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n*   **Introduce Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests for individual code components, especially those dealing with spatial relationships (e.g., a function that checks for adjacent cells). These tests can help verify the correctness of these components in isolation.\n*   **Implement a Code Debugger:** Integrate a simple code debugger into the system. This would allow the system to step through the generated code, inspect variable values, and identify the exact point where the execution diverges from the intended behavior.\n*   **Enhance Spatial Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to reason about spatial relationships. This might involve using a specialized spatial reasoning library or developing a more robust representation of spatial information.\n*   **Implement Pattern Decomposition:** Break down complex patterns into simpler, more manageable sub-patterns. This can make it easier to generate code for each sub-pattern and then combine the resulting code to form a complete solution.\n*   **Review Code for Common Errors:** Before executing the code, have the system review it for common errors, such as incorrect loop conditions, off-by-one errors, and incorrect indexing.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Success\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Success\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failure\n    *   solution\\_verification: Partial Success (identifies an error but unable to fix)\n    *   decision\\_making: Failure\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Success\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Success\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failure\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: Failure\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information\\_extraction: Failure\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Success\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failure\n    *   solution\\_verification: N/A\n    *   decision\\_making: Failure\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your requirements.\n\n## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**OVERALL PERFORMANCE:**  The system's performance is extremely poor, with 0% accuracy. While it demonstrates some pattern recognition abilities at a high level, it consistently fails to translate these observations into correct and generalized code. The iterative refinement attempts are largely ineffective, leading to increasingly complex but still incorrect solutions.\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   The system identifies the pattern of changing 0s to 2s near 1s. However, the initial code only considers left and up neighbors.\n    *   The system attempts to add a loop for \"propagation,\" but this doesn't fundamentally address the logic errors.\n    *   Later attempts add diagonal checks, further complicating the code and still failing to achieve the desired result.\n    *   The system appears to get stuck in a loop of adding increasingly complex conditions without truly understanding the underlying logic. The final code contains redundant checks.  The system does not understand that the propagation should be outwards until the edge of the shape.\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   The system recognizes the \"cross\" pattern but generates code that fills the entire rows and columns with the non-zero value, rather than creating a cross originating from the location. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of how to translate spatial reasoning to code.\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   The system completely fails to generalize and hardcodes a static grid as the output. This represents a significant failure in understanding the task's requirement for a *transformation* of the input. The system reduces the grid size significantly and uses the value \"3\" to signify the row size. This shows a lack of robust information extraction.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a fragile understanding of pattern recognition and an even weaker ability to translate those patterns into working code.  It can identify high-level relationships but fails to implement them correctly. The debugging and refinement process is largely ad-hoc and lacks a systematic approach. There is also a significant issue with generalization and overfitting to specific examples. The system does not appear to learn from previous failures in a meaningful way.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **High-Level Pattern Recognition:** The system can often identify the general type of pattern present in the input examples (e.g., identifying the \"cross\" pattern in Sample ID 1, the presence of '2's around the '1's in Sample ID 0).\n*   **Code Generation Attempt:** The system attempts to generate and execute Python code to solve the problem, which is a positive sign.\n*   **Iterative Refinement:** The system attempts to iteratively refine its solution based on perceived errors, even though these refinements are not effective.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Code Generation Accuracy:** The inability to reliably translate observed patterns into correct and efficient code.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The system struggles to translate spatial relationships (e.g., \"adjacent to,\" \"above,\" \"diagonal\") into code.\n*   **Generalization:** The system's inability to extract general rules from training examples and avoids overfitting to specific instances.\n*   **Debugging and Error Analysis:** The debugging process is unsystematic and relies on flawed assumptions.\n*   **Understanding of Iterative Processes:** The system does not handle iterative processes well, such as how a change in one cell can affect other cells in subsequent iterations.\n*    **Information Extraction:** Lack of robust information extraction to properly perform transformations of grids.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Code Generation Accuracy**. Without improvements here, all other capabilities are severely limited. Focus on getting the initial code generation step to produce more accurate and reliable implementations of the identified patterns.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Unit Tests for Spatial Relationships:**\n    *   Create a suite of unit tests for common spatial relationships (adjacent, above, below, diagonal). These tests should verify that the code correctly identifies cells based on these relationships.  For example, write unit tests to verify that a function correctly identifies all cells adjacent to a given cell.\n    *   Example: `assert get_adjacent_cells(grid, 2, 3) == [(1, 3), (3, 3), (2, 2), (2, 4)]`\n2.  **Introduce a Code Debugger with Intermediate Output:**\n    *   Integrate a code debugger that allows the system to step through the generated code and inspect variable values at each step.\n    *   Include the printing of intermediate grid states during execution to visualize the transformation process. This would help the system understand how the code is modifying the grid.\n3.  **Enhance Spatial Reasoning with a Specialized Library (Consider Exploration):**\n    *   Investigate using a spatial reasoning library or framework to represent and reason about spatial information. This could provide more robust and accurate spatial calculations. *Note: This is a more exploratory suggestion, as the overhead of integrating a new library needs to be weighed against the potential benefits.*\n4.  **Implement Pattern Decomposition and Code Generation in Stages:**\n    *   Break down the pattern recognition and code generation process into smaller, more manageable steps.\n    *   First, focus on accurately identifying the core pattern.\n    *   Second, generate code for each sub-pattern.\n    *   Third, combine the resulting code to form a complete solution.\n5.  **Implement Constraints to Prevent Hardcoded Solutions:**\n    *   Add a check to ensure that the generated code is actually operating on the input grid and transforming it in some way.\n    *   If the output is a static value, throw an error and force the system to try a different approach.\n6.   **Implement Checks for Grid Size Variations:**\n    *   Add checks to determine if the input and output grids have different sizes.\n    *   If the output grid changes size, determine if it is within the constraints of the prompt.\n7.  **Review Code for Common Errors Before Execution:**\n    *   Before executing the code, have the system review it for common errors, such as incorrect loop conditions, off-by-one errors, incorrect indexing, and hardcoded values. This could involve using a static analysis tool or implementing custom checks.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level.** There is no evidence of improvement and some evidence of getting further from a correct solution with each iteration due to the addition of complexity. The system needs fundamental improvements in code generation and debugging to show any meaningful progress.\n"

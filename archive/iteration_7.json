  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings using two LLM-driven agents: an Extraction Agent and a Scheduling Agent. The Extraction Agent extracts meeting details and validates the extracted information, and the Scheduling Agent determines a final proposed time based on the extracted details. The main function orchestrates the process by first calling the Extraction Agent and then the Scheduling Agent. The `call_llm` function interacts with the LLM, and `extract_meeting_info` extracts the data while `schedule_meeting` finds a time. The overall workflow is extract, schedule, and return, with verification after the extraction step.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe dominant runtime error across all provided error cases is: \"name 'call_llm' is not defined\". This indicates a fundamental issue in the code's execution environment. The `call_llm` function, presumably used to interact with the Large Language Model, is not accessible or has not been properly defined or imported.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nBased on the prompt and the limited information available, it's difficult to assess specific strengths of the current approach. However, we can infer potential strengths:\n\n1.  **Structured Problem Definition:** The prompt includes clear guidelines and examples, suggesting a structured approach to problem-solving.\n2.  **Modular Design (Intended):** The design incorporates various functions (like `hybrid_math_solver`, `solve_with_react_pattern`, `multi_perspective_analysis`), suggesting an intention to build a modular and reusable system.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Missing Core Functionality:** The \"name 'call_llm' is not defined\" error indicates a critical piece of core functionality is missing or inaccessible during runtime. This makes the entire system unusable.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling (in Core Function Call):** While the provided examples show some error handling within specific functions, the failure of `call_llm` is a fatal error, suggesting a lack of robust error handling at the most fundamental level. The system doesn't gracefully degrade or attempt to recover when the LLM interface fails.\n3.  **Dependency on External LLM:** The system is entirely reliant on an external LLM being accessible. The error shows that there is no fallback in case that dependency is missing or unavailable.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **`call_llm` Function Undefined/Inaccessible:** This is the primary bottleneck. Until this function is correctly defined and accessible, the system cannot function.\n2.  **Lack of Fallback Mechanism for LLM Dependency:** The system crashes completely if the LLM cannot be accessed.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe error \"name 'call_llm' is not defined\" is a recurring pattern across ALL samples. This means the entire system is fundamentally broken in the current environment, regardless of the specific scheduling problem.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is that the `call_llm` function is not defined or accessible during the execution of the code. This prevents the system from interacting with the LLM, rendering it incapable of solving any problem.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **`call_llm` Definition/Import:** Ensure the `call_llm` function is properly defined within the execution scope or imported correctly.\n2.  **Dependency Management:** Establish a clear dependency management strategy (e.g., using `pip` and a `requirements.txt` file) to ensure all necessary libraries and modules are available.\n3.  **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling, especially around external API calls (like `call_llm`). This should include try-except blocks and fallback mechanisms.\n4.  **LLM Availability Check:** Implement a check to verify the LLM is available before attempting to solve problems. If unavailable, provide a graceful error message and potentially a placeholder or cached response.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Define `call_llm`:** Explicitly define the `call_llm` function within the main script or module, or import it from a separate module where it is defined. This function should handle the actual API call to the LLM service (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere). For example:\n\n```python\ndef call_llm(prompt, system=None):\n    \"\"\"Interface to LLM API with optional system prompt\"\"\"\n    # Replace with actual API call\n    try:\n        import openai\n        openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n\n        messages = []\n        if system:\n            messages.append({\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system})\n        messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt})\n\n        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n            model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",  # Or another suitable model\n            messages=messages,\n            temperature=0.7, # Adjust for creativity/predictability\n        )\n        return response.choices[0].message[\"content\"]\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error calling LLM: {e}\")\n        return \"LLM call failed: \" + str(e) # More informative error message\n\n```\n\n2.  **Implement Dependency Management:** Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all external dependencies (e.g., `openai`, `tiktoken`) and use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.\n\n3.  **Add Error Handling:** Wrap the `call_llm` function in a `try...except` block to catch potential exceptions (e.g., network errors, API errors, rate limits). Implement a fallback mechanism, such as using a cached response or a simpler, local model, if the LLM is unavailable.\n\n4. **Implement LLM availability check**: Before starting the meeting scheduling process, check if the LLM is available. This can be done by attempting a simple call to the LLM and catching any exceptions. If unavailable, display a user-friendly error message and abort the process gracefully. This could involve a simple \"ping\" function that makes a quick, low-cost API call to confirm the service is up and running.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nDue to the `call_llm` error, *all* capabilities are failing across all samples:\n\n*   **Sample 0-9:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed due to `call_llm` error\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed due to `call_llm` error\n    *   solution_generation: Failed due to `call_llm` error\n    *   solution_verification: Failed due to `call_llm` error\n    *   decision_making: Failed due to `call_llm` error\n",

    "capability_report": {
      "text_report": "Okay, I will provide a thorough capability assessment as requested, based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and the overall context.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs consistently show the error \"name 'call_llm' is not defined\". This is a **fatal error** that prevents the system from executing *any* meaningful logic.  The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` markers suggest that the error occurs before the system can even begin to process the input and generate a response.  The repetition of this error across all samples indicates that the underlying issue is systemic and not specific to any particular input.  The system is fundamentally unable to use the LLM.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has **zero demonstrated capabilities**. It is unable to perform even the most basic operations due to the missing `call_llm` function. Any higher-level capabilities (information extraction, constraint handling, etc.) are entirely blocked by this foundational problem.  The conceptual design may be sound (as suggested by the prompt), but the current implementation is completely non-functional. The prompt suggests a multi-agent approach, using LLMs for understanding, but the fact that `call_llm` is undefined means no LLM interaction is happening at all.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Clear Problem Definition (Potential):** The detailed prompt and examples suggest a good understanding of the problem domain and a well-structured approach to problem-solving *in theory*.  However, this is purely theoretical since the system cannot currently execute any of this structured approach.\n*   **Modular Design (Intended):** The modular design (as inferred from the function names) is a potential strength, suggesting that the system *could* be easier to maintain and extend once the core issue is resolved. However, again, this is only a design intention, as the code is not currently functional.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Missing Core Functionality (`call_llm`):** The absence of the `call_llm` function is the *single most critical weakness*. It renders the entire system unusable.\n*   **Lack of Dependency Management:** The fact that `call_llm` is missing suggests a broader lack of dependency management, meaning there is no clear way to ensure that all necessary components are available.\n*   **No LLM Fallback:** The complete failure when `call_llm` is missing highlights a critical lack of robustness. The system needs a fallback mechanism in case the LLM is unavailable.\n*   **Zero Performance:** The system currently has no demonstrated ability to solve *any* problems.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe **single most important capability to focus on improving** is **basic functionality**. This means ensuring that the `call_llm` function is defined and that the system can successfully interact with the LLM. Until this is resolved, no other improvements are possible.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement `call_llm` Immediately:** Define the `call_llm` function (or import it from a working module). This function should handle the API call to the LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI). Use the example implementation from the previous response, replacing `\"YOUR_API_KEY\"` with your actual API key and making sure the correct `openai` package is installed.  Test this function independently to ensure it works.\n\n    ```python\n    def call_llm(prompt, system=None):\n        \"\"\"Interface to LLM API with optional system prompt\"\"\"\n        # Replace with actual API call\n        try:\n            import openai\n            openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n\n            messages = []\n            if system:\n                messages.append({\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system})\n            messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt})\n\n            response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n                model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",  # Or another suitable model\n                messages=messages,\n                temperature=0.7, # Adjust for creativity/predictability\n            )\n            return response.choices[0].message[\"content\"]\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error calling LLM: {e}\")\n            return \"LLM call failed: \" + str(e) # More informative error message\n    ```\n\n2.  **Create a `requirements.txt` File:** Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies (including `openai` and any other required libraries).  Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.  This will ensure that all necessary libraries are available.\n\n3.  **Test `call_llm` Directly:** Before running the entire system, test the `call_llm` function in isolation.  Pass it a simple prompt and verify that it successfully interacts with the LLM. This will help to isolate any problems with the LLM API call itself.\n\n4.  **Add a Basic LLM Availability Check:** Add code to check if the LLM is available before attempting to process any questions. This could involve a simple \"ping\" function that makes a quick, low-cost API call to confirm the service is up and running.\n\n5.  **Implement Basic Error Handling in `call_llm`:**  Ensure that the `call_llm` function includes a `try...except` block to catch potential exceptions (e.g., network errors, API errors, rate limits). The `except` block should print an informative error message to the console *and* return a default error string. This will prevent the entire system from crashing when the LLM is unavailable.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **non-existent**. There are no capabilities demonstrated to improve or decline. Until the `call_llm` issue is resolved, the trend will remain at zero. Once the basic functionality is established, we can begin to track and improve specific capabilities.\n",

For example:\n\n```python\ndef call_llm(prompt, system=None):\n    \"\"\"Interface to LLM API with optional system prompt\"\"\"\n    # Replace with actual API call\n    try:\n        import openai\n        openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n\n        messages = []\n        if system:\n            messages.append({\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system})\n        messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt})\n\n        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n            model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",  # Or another suitable model\n            messages=messages,\n            temperature=0.7, # Adjust for creativity/predictability\n        )\n        return response.choices[0].message[\"content\"]\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error calling LLM: {e}\")\n        return \"LLM call failed: \" + str(e) # More informative error message\n\n```\n\n2.  **Implement Dependency Management:** Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all external dependencies (e.g., `openai`, `tiktoken`) and use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.\n\n3.  **Add Error Handling:** Wrap the `call_llm` function in a `try...except` block to catch potential exceptions (e.g., network errors, API errors, rate limits). Implement a fallback mechanism, such as using a cached response or a simpler, local model, if the LLM is unavailable.\n\n4. **Implement LLM availability check**: Before starting the meeting scheduling process, check if the LLM is available. This can be done by attempting a simple call to the LLM and catching any exceptions. If unavailable, display a user-friendly error message and abort the process gracefully. This could involve a simple \"ping\" function that makes a quick, low-cost API call to confirm the service is up and running.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nDue to the `call_llm` error, *all* capabilities are failing across all samples:\n\n*   **Sample 0-9:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed due to `call_llm` error\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed due to `call_llm` error\n    *   solution_generation: Failed due to `call_llm` error\n    *   solution_verification: Failed due to `call_llm` error\n    *   decision_making: Failed due to `call_llm` error\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, I will provide a thorough capability assessment as requested, based on the performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and the overall context.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs consistently show the error \"name 'call_llm' is not defined\". This is a **fatal error** that prevents the system from executing *any* meaningful logic.  The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` markers suggest that the error occurs before the system can even begin to process the input and generate a response.  The repetition of this error across all samples indicates that the underlying issue is systemic and not specific to any particular input.  The system is fundamentally unable to use the LLM.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently has **zero demonstrated capabilities**. It is unable to perform even the most basic operations due to the missing `call_llm` function. Any higher-level capabilities (information extraction, constraint handling, etc.) are entirely blocked by this foundational problem.  The conceptual design may be sound (as suggested by the prompt), but the current implementation is completely non-functional. The prompt suggests a multi-agent approach, using LLMs for understanding, but the fact that `call_llm` is undefined means no LLM interaction is happening at all.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Clear Problem Definition (Potential):** The detailed prompt and examples suggest a good understanding of the problem domain and a well-structured approach to problem-solving *in theory*.  However, this is purely theoretical since the system cannot currently execute any of this structured approach.\n*   **Modular Design (Intended):** The modular design (as inferred from the function names) is a potential strength, suggesting that the system *could* be easier to maintain and extend once the core issue is resolved. However, again, this is only a design intention, as the code is not currently functional.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Missing Core Functionality (`call_llm`):** The absence of the `call_llm` function is the *single most critical weakness*. It renders the entire system unusable.\n*   **Lack of Dependency Management:** The fact that `call_llm` is missing suggests a broader lack of dependency management, meaning there is no clear way to ensure that all necessary components are available.\n*   **No LLM Fallback:** The complete failure when `call_llm` is missing highlights a critical lack of robustness. The system needs a fallback mechanism in case the LLM is unavailable.\n*   **Zero Performance:** The system currently has no demonstrated ability to solve *any* problems.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe **single most important capability to focus on improving** is **basic functionality**. This means ensuring that the `call_llm` function is defined and that the system can successfully interact with the LLM. Until this is resolved, no other improvements are possible.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement `call_llm` Immediately:** Define the `call_llm` function (or import it from a working module). This function should handle the API call to the LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI). Use the example implementation from the previous response, replacing `\"YOUR_API_KEY\"` with your actual API key and making sure the correct `openai` package is installed.  Test this function independently to ensure it works.\n\n    ```python\n    def call_llm(prompt, system=None):\n        \"\"\"Interface to LLM API with optional system prompt\"\"\"\n        # Replace with actual API call\n        try:\n            import openai\n            openai.api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n\n            messages = []\n            if system:\n                messages.append({\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system})\n            messages.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt})\n\n            response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n                model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",  # Or another suitable model\n                messages=messages,\n                temperature=0.7, # Adjust for creativity/predictability\n            )\n            return response.choices[0].message[\"content\"]\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error calling LLM: {e}\")\n            return \"LLM call failed: \" + str(e) # More informative error message\n    ```\n\n2.  **Create a `requirements.txt` File:** Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies (including `openai` and any other required libraries).  Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them.  This will ensure that all necessary libraries are available.\n\n3.  **Test `call_llm` Directly:** Before running the entire system, test the `call_llm` function in isolation.  Pass it a simple prompt and verify that it successfully interacts with the LLM. This will help to isolate any problems with the LLM API call itself.\n\n4.  **Add a Basic LLM Availability Check:** Add code to check if the LLM is available before attempting to process any questions. This could involve a simple \"ping\" function that makes a quick, low-cost API call to confirm the service is up and running.\n\n5.  **Implement Basic Error Handling in `call_llm`:**  Ensure that the `call_llm` function includes a `try...except` block to catch potential exceptions (e.g., network errors, API errors, rate limits). The `except` block should print an informative error message to the console *and* return a default error string. This will prevent the entire system from crashing when the LLM is unavailable.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **non-existent**. There are no capabilities demonstrated to improve or decline. Until the `call_llm` issue is resolved, the trend will remain at zero. Once the basic functionality is established, we can begin to track and improve specific capabilities.\n"

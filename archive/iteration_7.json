  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM-driven approach to solve grid transformation problems by generating and scoring possible transformation rules. It decomposes the problem into rule generation, scoring, selection, application, and formatting steps. The agents include rule generation, rule evaluation, application, and formatting experts. The `call_llm` function sends prompts to the Gemini LLM, and `analyze_grid_transformation` orchestrates the entire process; `main` calls `analyze_grid_transformation` and returns the answer. The workflow involves generating candidate rules, scoring them, selecting the best rule, applying it to the test input, and formatting the output.",

However, it *halts* execution before applying any transformation, indicating a failure to extract the transformation rule. It essentially requests the *transformed* grid, which defeats the purpose.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system *does* output a grid in the correct Python list of lists format, but the grid itself is incorrect. It appears to be arbitrarily filling in zeros around the provided \"2\" input, without any relation to the training examples' actual transformations.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** Similar to Sample ID 1, the system produces a grid output, but it's completely unrelated to the training data and the intended transformation. The numbers seem randomly placed. No transformation rule is explained.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very low capability in grid transformation tasks. While it understands the required output format, it fundamentally fails at:\n\n1.  **Understanding and extracting transformation rules.**\n2.  **Applying those rules to transform the input grid.**\n3.  **Explaining the reasoning behind the transformation.**\n\nThe system's attempts at generating a grid appear random, suggesting a lack of understanding of abstract patterns and logical manipulation of visual data.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Understanding of the required output format (Python list of lists).** This is a basic but crucial element for generating valid outputs.\n*   **Clear Instruction Following (Attempts):** The system *attempts* to generate a grid, showing it understands the prompt's core requirement.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Failure to Infer Transformation Rules:** The system's core weakness is its inability to learn and apply the transformation rules from the training examples. This is the bottleneck that prevents accurate solution generation.\n*   **Lack of Abstract Reasoning:** It lacks the ability to reason abstractly about the patterns presented in the grids.\n*   **Missing Explanations:** The system completely fails to explain its reasoning process and the applied transformation rules, as requested.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition** - specifically, the system's ability to *infer* and *abstract* transformation rules from the provided training data. Without this core capability, no other improvements will lead to meaningful results.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Feature Extraction:** Integrate CNNs (or a similar architecture suitable for visual pattern recognition) into the system. Train the CNNs to extract relevant features from the training examples that can then be used to infer transformation rules. This will address the **Pattern Recognition** weakness.\n2.  **Develop a Rule Representation Language:** Define a formal language or data structure to represent transformation rules. This will force the system to explicitly define the rules it infers. This could be as simple as a set of operations applied to coordinates, or more complex involving color and shape transformations.\n3.  **Implement Rule Application Module with Unit Tests:** Create a dedicated module that *only* focuses on *applying* a given transformation rule to the input grid. Write extensive unit tests for this module to ensure it operates correctly. This isolates the rule application component and makes debugging easier.\n4. **Decompose the task with Chain of Thought Reasoning:** Force the model to first, explicitly state its inferred transformation rule. Second, apply the rule step-by-step on the input grid. Finally, output the transformed grid.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable at a very low level.** Without significant architectural and algorithmic changes (like those recommended above), the system's performance is unlikely to improve. The trend will remain flat until concrete improvements are implemented.\n",

However, it *halts* execution before applying any transformation, indicating a failure to extract the transformation rule. It essentially requests the *transformed* grid, which defeats the purpose.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system *does* output a grid in the correct Python list of lists format, but the grid itself is incorrect. It appears to be arbitrarily filling in zeros around the provided \"2\" input, without any relation to the training examples' actual transformations.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** Similar to Sample ID 1, the system produces a grid output, but it's completely unrelated to the training data and the intended transformation. The numbers seem randomly placed. No transformation rule is explained.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very low capability in grid transformation tasks. While it understands the required output format, it fundamentally fails at:\n\n1.  **Understanding and extracting transformation rules.**\n2.  **Applying those rules to transform the input grid.**\n3.  **Explaining the reasoning behind the transformation.**\n\nThe system's attempts at generating a grid appear random, suggesting a lack of understanding of abstract patterns and logical manipulation of visual data.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Understanding of the required output format (Python list of lists).** This is a basic but crucial element for generating valid outputs.\n*   **Clear Instruction Following (Attempts):** The system *attempts* to generate a grid, showing it understands the prompt's core requirement.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Failure to Infer Transformation Rules:** The system's core weakness is its inability to learn and apply the transformation rules from the training examples. This is the bottleneck that prevents accurate solution generation.\n*   **Lack of Abstract Reasoning:** It lacks the ability to reason abstractly about the patterns presented in the grids.\n*   **Missing Explanations:** The system completely fails to explain its reasoning process and the applied transformation rules, as requested.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition** - specifically, the system's ability to *infer* and *abstract* transformation rules from the provided training data. Without this core capability, no other improvements will lead to meaningful results.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Feature Extraction:** Integrate CNNs (or a similar architecture suitable for visual pattern recognition) into the system. Train the CNNs to extract relevant features from the training examples that can then be used to infer transformation rules. This will address the **Pattern Recognition** weakness.\n2.  **Develop a Rule Representation Language:** Define a formal language or data structure to represent transformation rules. This will force the system to explicitly define the rules it infers. This could be as simple as a set of operations applied to coordinates, or more complex involving color and shape transformations.\n3.  **Implement Rule Application Module with Unit Tests:** Create a dedicated module that *only* focuses on *applying* a given transformation rule to the input grid. Write extensive unit tests for this module to ensure it operates correctly. This isolates the rule application component and makes debugging easier.\n4. **Decompose the task with Chain of Thought Reasoning:** Force the model to first, explicitly state its inferred transformation rule. Second, apply the rule step-by-step on the input grid. Finally, output the transformed grid.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable at a very low level.** Without significant architectural and algorithmic changes (like those recommended above), the system's performance is unlikely to improve. The trend will remain flat until concrete improvements are implemented.\n"

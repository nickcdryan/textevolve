  "approach_summary": "The script solves meeting scheduling problems by using an LLM to extract participants and constraints from a question, solve the scheduling problem, and verify the proposed solution. It uses a chain-of-thought approach where the problem is broken down into sequential steps involving extraction, problem-solving, and verification with specialized LLM prompts. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow, calling `extract_participants`, `extract_constraints`, `solve_meeting_problem`, and `verify_solution` in sequence to generate and validate a meeting time. The `call_llm` function is used by each of the LLM-based functions to interface with the Google Gemini API.",

      "text_report": "Here's a comprehensive capability assessment of your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Incorrect meeting times suggested**: The system provides specific meeting times (e.g., Monday, 17:00 - 17:30, and Monday, 13:30 - 14:00) but fails to acknowledge conflicting schedules from the constraints summary. The analysis in sample 1 correctly identifies that participants are busy, yet the suggested solution conflicts.\n\n*   **Inaccurate availability assessments**: In sample 1, after listing who is busy at various times, the system inaccurately concludes \"The only time slot where all participants are free is 13:30 - 14:00 on Monday.\" This is patently false according to its own analysis, highlighting a reasoning error.\n\n*   **Preference Misinterpretation**: The system acknowledges Walter's preferences in sample 3, but its ultimate selection of Monday between 13:30 and 14:00 seemingly ignores the avoidance of Mondays before 12:00. It explains its reasoning, but the decision-making logic contradicts stated preferences.\n\n*   **Verbose Output**: The output in some cases is quite verbose including constraints summaries that have no bearing on the final solution\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of scheduling problems, including parsing inputs to identify participants, time constraints, and preferences. However, it struggles to accurately integrate and apply these constraints to generate feasible solutions. The core weakness lies in its reasoning and verification capabilities, leading to suggestions that contradict its own analysis.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Input Parsing**: The system can parse and extract relevant information from natural language inputs related to scheduling.\n*   **Constraint Identification**: The system successfully identifies explicit time constraints and preferences from the input.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Application**: The system fails to rigorously apply constraints when generating potential solutions, leading to scheduling conflicts.\n*   **Reasoning and Verification**: The system lacks a robust reasoning engine to ensure that suggested times comply with all constraints.\n*   **Preference Integration**: There's a failure to incorporate and prioritize stated preferences in the solution.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Application**, which directly impacts the accuracy and feasibility of proposed solutions. This includes validating the scheduling constraints and verifying the solution against existing schedules.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Constraint Data Structures**: Instead of textual analysis, represent participant availability using data structures (e.g., arrays or lists) that explicitly flag blocked time slots.\n\n    ```python\n    # Example representation:\n    participant_schedules = {\n        \"Amber\": [(\"Monday\", 9.0, 9.5), (\"Monday\", 10.0, 10.5), ...], # (day, start_time, end_time)\n        \"Christian\": [...],\n        ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n2.  **Develop a Solution Verification Function**: Create a dedicated function to verify whether a proposed meeting time is valid for *all* participants. This function should iterate through participant schedules and return `False` immediately if any conflict is found.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_time_valid(proposed_time, participant_schedules, participants):\n        for participant in participants:\n            for schedule in participant_schedules[participant]:\n                if schedule[0] == proposed_time[0] and \\\n                   schedule[1] < proposed_time[2] and \\\n                   schedule[2] > proposed_time[1]: # Check for overlap\n                    return False # Conflict!\n        return True  # Time is valid for all participants\n    ```\n\n3.  **Refine Preference Handling**: Design a distinct module focused on the extraction and application of preferences. Assign a 'weight' to each preference to help the system make more intelligent scheduling decisions when constraints conflict.\n\n    ```python\n    #Example representation\n    preferences = {\n        \"Walter\": [(\"avoid\", \"Monday\", \"before 12:00\")],\n        \"Eugene\": []\n    }\n    ```\n\n4.  **Integrate ReAct agent for Constraint and Preference Check**: Introduce a ReAct agent that alternates between proposing potential times and verifying those times against the identified constraints and preferences.\n\n    *   **Reason**: Assess available time slots based on parsed constraints and preference.\n    *   **Act**: Propose a potential meeting time.\n    *   **Observe**: Verify that the proposed time satisfies the explicit time constraints of *all* participants using the `is_time_valid` function. Update plan based on validity. The `observe` stage can also check that preferences are being met.\n\n5.  **Test-Driven Development:** Create a test suite that explicitly covers edge cases and challenging scenarios. Use this test suite to validate that your changes are improving the system's performance.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy score of 0.60 (3/5) and the recurring error patterns, the system's capabilities appear **stable but with significant room for improvement**. The core issues of constraint application and reasoning have not been effectively addressed, indicating a need for fundamental architectural changes.\n",

This can be done by iterating through the availability of each participant for a given time.\n3.  **Preference Handling**: Use a separate module to extract all the preferences from the given question and make sure all preferences are incorporated into the solution.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 0**:\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed (incorrectly applying schedule constraints)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (not verifying the solution against existing schedules)\n*   **Sample 3**:\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Failed (incorrectly applying schedule constraints)\n    *   solution\\_verification: Failed (not verifying the solution against existing schedules)\n    *   preference\\_handling: Failed (not handling time preference requests)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Here's a comprehensive capability assessment of your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, and sample execution outputs:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\n*   **Incorrect meeting times suggested**: The system provides specific meeting times (e.g., Monday, 17:00 - 17:30, and Monday, 13:30 - 14:00) but fails to acknowledge conflicting schedules from the constraints summary. The analysis in sample 1 correctly identifies that participants are busy, yet the suggested solution conflicts.\n\n*   **Inaccurate availability assessments**: In sample 1, after listing who is busy at various times, the system inaccurately concludes \"The only time slot where all participants are free is 13:30 - 14:00 on Monday.\" This is patently false according to its own analysis, highlighting a reasoning error.\n\n*   **Preference Misinterpretation**: The system acknowledges Walter's preferences in sample 3, but its ultimate selection of Monday between 13:30 and 14:00 seemingly ignores the avoidance of Mondays before 12:00. It explains its reasoning, but the decision-making logic contradicts stated preferences.\n\n*   **Verbose Output**: The output in some cases is quite verbose including constraints summaries that have no bearing on the final solution\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of scheduling problems, including parsing inputs to identify participants, time constraints, and preferences. However, it struggles to accurately integrate and apply these constraints to generate feasible solutions. The core weakness lies in its reasoning and verification capabilities, leading to suggestions that contradict its own analysis.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Input Parsing**: The system can parse and extract relevant information from natural language inputs related to scheduling.\n*   **Constraint Identification**: The system successfully identifies explicit time constraints and preferences from the input.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Constraint Application**: The system fails to rigorously apply constraints when generating potential solutions, leading to scheduling conflicts.\n*   **Reasoning and Verification**: The system lacks a robust reasoning engine to ensure that suggested times comply with all constraints.\n*   **Preference Integration**: There's a failure to incorporate and prioritize stated preferences in the solution.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Constraint Application**, which directly impacts the accuracy and feasibility of proposed solutions. This includes validating the scheduling constraints and verifying the solution against existing schedules.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Explicit Constraint Data Structures**: Instead of textual analysis, represent participant availability using data structures (e.g., arrays or lists) that explicitly flag blocked time slots.\n\n    ```python\n    # Example representation:\n    participant_schedules = {\n        \"Amber\": [(\"Monday\", 9.0, 9.5), (\"Monday\", 10.0, 10.5), ...], # (day, start_time, end_time)\n        \"Christian\": [...],\n        ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n2.  **Develop a Solution Verification Function**: Create a dedicated function to verify whether a proposed meeting time is valid for *all* participants. This function should iterate through participant schedules and return `False` immediately if any conflict is found.\n\n    ```python\n    def is_time_valid(proposed_time, participant_schedules, participants):\n        for participant in participants:\n            for schedule in participant_schedules[participant]:\n                if schedule[0] == proposed_time[0] and \\\n                   schedule[1] < proposed_time[2] and \\\n                   schedule[2] > proposed_time[1]: # Check for overlap\n                    return False # Conflict!\n        return True  # Time is valid for all participants\n    ```\n\n3.  **Refine Preference Handling**: Design a distinct module focused on the extraction and application of preferences. Assign a 'weight' to each preference to help the system make more intelligent scheduling decisions when constraints conflict.\n\n    ```python\n    #Example representation\n    preferences = {\n        \"Walter\": [(\"avoid\", \"Monday\", \"before 12:00\")],\n        \"Eugene\": []\n    }\n    ```\n\n4.  **Integrate ReAct agent for Constraint and Preference Check**: Introduce a ReAct agent that alternates between proposing potential times and verifying those times against the identified constraints and preferences.\n\n    *   **Reason**: Assess available time slots based on parsed constraints and preference.\n    *   **Act**: Propose a potential meeting time.\n    *   **Observe**: Verify that the proposed time satisfies the explicit time constraints of *all* participants using the `is_time_valid` function. Update plan based on validity. The `observe` stage can also check that preferences are being met.\n\n5.  **Test-Driven Development:** Create a test suite that explicitly covers edge cases and challenging scenarios. Use this test suite to validate that your changes are improving the system's performance.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current accuracy score of 0.60 (3/5) and the recurring error patterns, the system's capabilities appear **stable but with significant room for improvement**. The core issues of constraint application and reasoning have not been effectively addressed, indicating a need for fundamental architectural changes.\n"

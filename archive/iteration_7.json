This agent can use LLM to analyze extracted information and find any contradictions. For example, it can check that a participant's busy slots don't overlap, or the duration makes sense given start and end times.",

        "Reliance on brittle rule-based parsing techniques (e.g., regular expressions) for information extraction.",

        "Lack of input sanitization or normalization.",
        "Absence of a verification mechanism to ensure the completeness and consistency of extracted information.",

  "approach_summary": "The script solves the meeting scheduling problem by using an LLM in a multi-agent workflow. It begins by extracting constraints from the input question using the `extract_constraints` function, which leverages the LLM to identify participants, duration, and time restrictions. The extracted constraints are then passed to the `schedule_meeting` function, which uses the LLM to generate a proposed meeting schedule. Finally, the `verify_schedule` function uses the LLM to verify if the proposed schedule satisfies all extracted constraints, showing reasoning, before returning the schedule or an error. \n\nThe main function orchestrates the process, calls the other functions, and handles exceptions. It calls the functions in the order `extract_constraints(question)` then `schedule_meeting(constraints)` then `verify_schedule(constraints, schedule)`. Error handling is incorporated throughout the process to catch and return errors that may arise during the LLM calls or other operations.",

The system successfully parses the constraints to build its schedule\n*   **Time Slot Evaluation:** It systematically evaluates potential time slots based on these constraints.\n*   **Suitable Time Slot Identification:** For the provided examples, the system is able to identify an available time slot for the meeting with the supplied constraints\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system shows a good capability for parsing constraints, checking availability, and proposing time slots. However, it is crucial to emphasize that the error analysis is more telling than the successful samples. A system that only evaluates *one* proposed time slot and then stops is extremely limited.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Constraint Identification and Application:** Accurately parsing, understanding, and applying scheduling constraints.\n*   **Availability Checking:** Effectively determining time slot conflicts.\n*   **Reasoning Transparency:** The reasoning process is clearly outlined and easy to follow.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Lack of Solution Generation:** The system's inability to actively *generate* valid time slot options, instead relying on evaluating a single, pre-determined option, is its most glaring weakness.\n*   **Premature Termination:** The system stops evaluating slots after finding an initial invalid slot and does not backtrack\n*   **Limited Preference Handling:** Seems to identify preferences but not act on them if a conflict occurs.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Solution Generation**. The system *must* be able to generate multiple valid meeting time proposals when the initial proposed time does not work.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, focusing on *LLM-centric* approaches:\n\n1.  **ReAct Pattern for Solution Generation and Refinement:**\n    *   Instead of a simple \"find earliest available\" approach, use the ReAct pattern.\n    *   *Reason*: \"I need to find a meeting time. I will first try [initial_time]. If that doesn't work I will try another slot\"\n    *   *Action*: \"Check availability for [time_slot]\"\n    *   *Observation*: \"[time_slot] is available/unavailable\"\n    *   *Reason* (if unavailable): \"I need to find another time since [time_slot] doesn't work. I will try [new_time]\"\n    *   Terminate after a `max_attempts` limit to prevent infinite loops.\n    *   **Critically, use LLM reasoning for *how* to generate the next time slot**:\n        *   \"Based on the conflict at [time] with [participant], suggest three alternative times that might work, considering [participant]'s schedule and typical meeting durations.\" This offloads the difficult part (generating times) to the LLM.\n\n2.  **Constraint Satisfaction Prompt Engineering:**\n    *   Define a prompt that treats scheduling as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n    *   Provide the LLM with examples of how to systematically explore the solution space, considering all constraints.\n    *   Use Few-Shot learning to provide examples of backtracking: \"If time X doesn't work because of participant Y, try times before/after X based on Y's schedule.\"\n\n3.  **Preference Handling Enhancement:**\n    *   Prompt the LLM to *negotiate* around preferences. Example:  \"If a meeting on Wednesday is preferred, but impossible, what is the next best day, considering participant schedules?\"\n\n4.  **Multi-Agent Approach (Optional, but Recommended):**\n    *   Create a \"Scheduler Agent\" and a \"Verifier Agent.\"\n    *   The Scheduler proposes times; the Verifier *critiques* them, identifying constraint violations.\n    *   The Scheduler then *reacts* to the Verifier's critique to propose a revised time.\n\n**Code Example (Illustrative, Replace Existing Logic):**\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, schedules, preferences, max_attempts=5):\n    \"\"\"Find a meeting time using ReAct and LLM-driven time slot generation.\"\"\"\n\n    system_prompt = \"\"\"You are a scheduling expert who uses the ReAct pattern.\n    You will propose meeting times, check their validity, and revise them based on feedback.\n    Prioritize participant preferences when possible.\n    \"\"\"\n    reasoning = \"I need to find a time that works for everyone. I will start with a reasonable guess.\"\n    time_slot = \"Monday, 10:00 - 10:30\"  # Initial guess\n\n    for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Participants: {participants}\n        Schedules: {schedules}\n        Preferences: {preferences}\n        Current Time Slot: {time_slot}\n        {reasoning}\n\n        1.  *Action*: Check availability for {time_slot}\n        2.  Provide next reasoning based on whether available or not.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        response = call_llm(prompt, system=system_prompt)  # Assuming you have a function to call the LLM\n\n        if \"available\" in response:\n            return time_slot  # Success!\n        else:\n            # LLM-driven time slot generation based on conflict:\n            reasoning = f\"\"\"That time slot is not available. {response}. Generate three alternative times that might work for {participants}, considering schedules and typical meeting durations.\"\"\"\n            time_slot = call_llm(f\"Suggest a time slot, considering {response}\")\n            # Extract from time_slot - time, day, participants\n            #  that are available based on feedback in response\n            # Add max attempts loop here\n\n    return \"Unable to find a suitable time slot after several attempts.\"\n```\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the limited data, capabilities are currently *stable* but with significant room for improvement. Focusing on solution generation should lead to a clear *improving* trend in the next iteration.\n",

It primarily focuses on validating a single pre-existing time slot instead of searching for or creating a suitable solution.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Solution Generation:** Implement a more robust solution generation component that can propose multiple valid time slots.\n2.  **Iterative Refinement:** Develop a mechanism to refine proposed solutions based on constraint violations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a \"Generate-and-Test\" Loop:** Modify the system to generate multiple potential meeting times and then test each one against the constraints.\n2.  **Introduce a Backtracking Mechanism:** If a proposed time slot violates a constraint, implement a backtracking mechanism to intelligently select a new, potentially valid, time.\n3.  **Employ a Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm:** Consider using a constraint satisfaction algorithm to systematically explore the solution space and find a valid meeting time.\n4.  **Integrate Solution Generation Earlier:** Move the solution generation step earlier in the process, rather than relying on a potentially flawed initial proposal.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 5:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Correctly identified and applied the preference constraint.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid solution when the initial time slot was invalid.\n*   **Sample ID 8:**\n    *   constraint\\_handling: Correctly identified schedule constraints.\n    *   solution\\_generation: Failed to generate a valid solution when the initial time slot was invalid.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, execution outputs, and your request for specific, actionable feedback.\n\n**## EXECUTION ANALYSIS**\n\nThe provided execution outputs reveal the following:\n\n*   **Reasoning Process:** The system demonstrates a clear reasoning process by identifying participant availabilities and preferences. The system successfully parses the constraints to build its schedule\n*   **Time Slot Evaluation:** It systematically evaluates potential time slots based on these constraints.\n*   **Suitable Time Slot Identification:** For the provided examples, the system is able to identify an available time slot for the meeting with the supplied constraints\n\n**## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**\n\nThe system shows a good capability for parsing constraints, checking availability, and proposing time slots. However, it is crucial to emphasize that the error analysis is more telling than the successful samples. A system that only evaluates *one* proposed time slot and then stops is extremely limited.\n\n**## KEY STRENGTHS**\n\n*   **Constraint Identification and Application:** Accurately parsing, understanding, and applying scheduling constraints.\n*   **Availability Checking:** Effectively determining time slot conflicts.\n*   **Reasoning Transparency:** The reasoning process is clearly outlined and easy to follow.\n\n**## KEY WEAKNESSES**\n\n*   **Lack of Solution Generation:** The system's inability to actively *generate* valid time slot options, instead relying on evaluating a single, pre-determined option, is its most glaring weakness.\n*   **Premature Termination:** The system stops evaluating slots after finding an initial invalid slot and does not backtrack\n*   **Limited Preference Handling:** Seems to identify preferences but not act on them if a conflict occurs.\n\n**## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Solution Generation**. The system *must* be able to generate multiple valid meeting time proposals when the initial proposed time does not work.\n\n**## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS**\n\nHere are specific changes to implement in the next iteration, focusing on *LLM-centric* approaches:\n\n1.  **ReAct Pattern for Solution Generation and Refinement:**\n    *   Instead of a simple \"find earliest available\" approach, use the ReAct pattern.\n    *   *Reason*: \"I need to find a meeting time. I will first try [initial_time]. If that doesn't work I will try another slot\"\n    *   *Action*: \"Check availability for [time_slot]\"\n    *   *Observation*: \"[time_slot] is available/unavailable\"\n    *   *Reason* (if unavailable): \"I need to find another time since [time_slot] doesn't work. I will try [new_time]\"\n    *   Terminate after a `max_attempts` limit to prevent infinite loops.\n    *   **Critically, use LLM reasoning for *how* to generate the next time slot**:\n        *   \"Based on the conflict at [time] with [participant], suggest three alternative times that might work, considering [participant]'s schedule and typical meeting durations.\" This offloads the difficult part (generating times) to the LLM.\n\n2.  **Constraint Satisfaction Prompt Engineering:**\n    *   Define a prompt that treats scheduling as a constraint satisfaction problem.\n    *   Provide the LLM with examples of how to systematically explore the solution space, considering all constraints.\n    *   Use Few-Shot learning to provide examples of backtracking: \"If time X doesn't work because of participant Y, try times before/after X based on Y's schedule.\"\n\n3.  **Preference Handling Enhancement:**\n    *   Prompt the LLM to *negotiate* around preferences. Example:  \"If a meeting on Wednesday is preferred, but impossible, what is the next best day, considering participant schedules?\"\n\n4.  **Multi-Agent Approach (Optional, but Recommended):**\n    *   Create a \"Scheduler Agent\" and a \"Verifier Agent.\"\n    *   The Scheduler proposes times; the Verifier *critiques* them, identifying constraint violations.\n    *   The Scheduler then *reacts* to the Verifier's critique to propose a revised time.\n\n**Code Example (Illustrative, Replace Existing Logic):**\n\n```python\ndef find_meeting_time(participants, schedules, preferences, max_attempts=5):\n    \"\"\"Find a meeting time using ReAct and LLM-driven time slot generation.\"\"\"\n\n    system_prompt = \"\"\"You are a scheduling expert who uses the ReAct pattern.\n    You will propose meeting times, check their validity, and revise them based on feedback.\n    Prioritize participant preferences when possible.\n    \"\"\"\n    reasoning = \"I need to find a time that works for everyone. I will start with a reasonable guess.\"\n    time_slot = \"Monday, 10:00 - 10:30\"  # Initial guess\n\n    for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n        prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Participants: {participants}\n        Schedules: {schedules}\n        Preferences: {preferences}\n        Current Time Slot: {time_slot}\n        {reasoning}\n\n        1.  *Action*: Check availability for {time_slot}\n        2.  Provide next reasoning based on whether available or not.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        response = call_llm(prompt, system=system_prompt)  # Assuming you have a function to call the LLM\n\n        if \"available\" in response:\n            return time_slot  # Success!\n        else:\n            # LLM-driven time slot generation based on conflict:\n            reasoning = f\"\"\"That time slot is not available. {response}. Generate three alternative times that might work for {participants}, considering schedules and typical meeting durations.\"\"\"\n            time_slot = call_llm(f\"Suggest a time slot, considering {response}\")\n            # Extract from time_slot - time, day, participants\n            #  that are available based on feedback in response\n            # Add max attempts loop here\n\n    return \"Unable to find a suitable time slot after several attempts.\"\n```\n\n**## CAPABILITY TREND**\n\nBased on the limited data, capabilities are currently *stable* but with significant room for improvement. Focusing on solution generation should lead to a clear *improving* trend in the next iteration.\n"

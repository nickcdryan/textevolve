  "approach_summary": "This script solves meeting scheduling problems by using LLMs for constraint extraction, time slot finding, and solution verification. The problem is decomposed into extracting constraints from the input text, finding available time slots based on these constraints, and then verifying the proposed solution against the original question. Three specialized agents are used: one to extract constraints, one to find time slots, and another to verify the solution, creating a multi-agent, chain-of-thought workflow.",

      "text_report": "## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Systematic Schedule Analysis:** The system attempts to methodically analyze the schedules of each participant, checking time slots for availability.\n2.  **Constraint Awareness:** The system acknowledges the importance of the time constraints (e.g., 9:00 to 17:00 work hours) and the duration of the meeting.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Busy Time Reconciliation:** The system frequently makes mistakes in determining if a time slot is truly free based on combined busy schedules. It struggles to synthesize overlapping busy periods and incorrectly marks slots as unavailable.\n2.  **Inefficient Solution Verification:** The system often re-checks already-evaluated time slots, indicating a lack of a systematic approach to tracking which times have been ruled out. It doesn't consistently apply all constraints during verification.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Flawed Busy Time Aggregation:** The core issue is an error-prone process for merging individual busy schedules to identify truly available slots. The system seems to struggle with overlapping time intervals.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Incorrect Availability Calculation:** The most common error is miscalculating whether a specific time slot is available for all participants, leading to the selection of incorrect meeting times. This occurs due to failures in accurately combining individual schedules.\n2.  **Inconsistent Constraint Application:** Even when some busy times are correctly identified, the system does not seem to consistently apply all constraints when determining availability, for example, failing to notice a participant is busy during a particular time.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is **inaccurate aggregation and application of busy schedules**, which leads to incorrect conclusions about overall availability. This is not a parsing issue in the sense of misinterpreting the input, but a *reasoning* error in how the extracted information (individual schedules) is combined to find a shared free time.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Constraint Handling (Specifically busy schedule aggregation):** The system needs a more reliable algorithm for merging individual busy schedules into a combined availability schedule. This should correctly account for overlapping intervals.\n2.  **Solution Verification:** Improve the consistency and thoroughness of verifying potential solutions against *all* participant schedules. Avoid re-checking already-evaluated slots.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Implement an interval-based busy time merging function:**\n    *   **Instead of:** Linearly checking each 30-minute or 60-minute slot.\n    *   **Use:** An algorithm that represents busy times as intervals and merges overlapping intervals into larger blocks of unavailability. This can be done using LLM to reason over how each interval effects each other, followed by simplying the results using an LLM.\n    *   **Example:** If Ashley is busy 9:00-9:30 and Gloria is busy 9:15-10:00, the function should correctly determine that 9:00-10:00 is blocked.\n    *   **LLM implementation:** Define a function `merge_intervals(intervals)` that receives a list of time intervals (e.g., \\[\"9:00-9:30\", \"9:15-10:00\"]) and returns a merged list (e.g., \\[\"9:00-10:00\"]). Use an LLM to accomplish this.\n    *   Use LLM with chain of thought to break down the interval merging and extract the proper ranges to merge.\n\n2.  **Create a \"Schedule Verification Agent\":**\n    *   **Instead of:** Ad-hoc checks of individual time slots.\n    *   **Use:** A dedicated agent that takes a proposed time, all participant schedules, and the meeting duration as input. The agent *must* return \"Available\" only if *all* participants are free for the entire duration.\n    *   **Example prompt for verification agent:**\n        ```\n        You are a meticulous schedule verifier.

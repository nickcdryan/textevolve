  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by first extracting a transformation rule from the input using an LLM, then applying this rule to generate the transformed grid, and finally verifying the generated grid. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates this process, using `call_llm` to interact with the LLM with prompts for rule extraction, grid transformation, and output verification. The `call_llm` function makes the API call and returns the LLM's text response; `solve_grid_transformation` retries with a maximum of 3 attempts, and if all attempts fail, returns a default grid. The main function takes the input and calls the `solve_grid_transformation` function.",

The errors seem to stem from incorrect logic and pattern recognition rather than technical execution issues.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can generate Python code to manipulate grids, demonstrating a basic understanding of programming principles.\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Limited):** The system attempts to identify patterns from training examples and apply them to the test input, showing an intention towards solving the task.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Incorrect Pattern Interpretation:** The system struggles to correctly identify and apply the underlying pattern in the training examples, leading to incorrect transformations of the test input. The system seems to fixate on specific details without grasping the overall transformation logic.\n*   **Lack of Spatial Reasoning:** The system doesn't seem to have a robust understanding of spatial relationships and how changes in one part of the grid affect other parts.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The ability to generalize from a few training examples to a novel test case is the primary bottleneck. The system seems to overfit to the provided examples without understanding the core transformation principle.\n*   **Abstract Reasoning:** The system needs to move beyond simple pattern matching and develop a more abstract understanding of the grid transformations.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of Replacement Logic:** The system often misidentifies which elements should be replaced and with what values, leading to incorrect output grids.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Rules:** Even if a pattern is partially recognized, its application across the entire grid is often inconsistent.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to accurately extract and generalize the transformation logic from the training examples. The system focuses on superficial similarities rather than understanding the underlying spatial relationships and rules governing the transformations.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **Pattern Extraction:** Develop more sophisticated algorithms for extracting patterns from the training examples. These algorithms should be able to identify spatial relationships, dependencies between elements, and the overall transformation logic.\n*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Implement mechanisms to ensure that the generated solutions satisfy the inherent constraints of the grid structure and the identified transformation rules.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Enhance the system's spatial reasoning capabilities to better understand how changes in one part of the grid affect other parts and to ensure consistent application of transformation rules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce a Pattern Abstraction Layer:** Instead of directly translating the input grids into output grids, introduce an intermediate layer where patterns are explicitly represented as rules or functions. This allows for more systematic application of the rules and easier generalization to new inputs.\n\n2.  **Implement a Rule-Based System:** Use a rule-based system to represent the transformation logic. The system can learn rules from the training examples and apply them to the test input. This allows for more flexible and interpretable transformations.\n\n3.  **Explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** For grid-based problems, CNNs are often effective at extracting spatial features and learning complex patterns. Train a CNN to predict the output grid based on the input grid and the training examples.\n\n4.  **Add Intermediate Print Statements:** Insert `print` statements within the core logic to track intermediate values and the program's reasoning steps. This will help in debugging and identifying where the system is going wrong. For example, in `transform_grid`, print the `block` variable to see the extracted subgrid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n\n*   information_extraction: Failed to correctly understand the pattern of '2' placement.\n*   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect grid.\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information_extraction: Failed to accurately extract the overall transformation pattern, specifically where '2's and '8's should be placed.\n*   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect grid based on the misidentified pattern.\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**AI System:** Grid Transformation System\n**Assessment Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several key issues:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 & 1:** The generated grids are incorrect, indicating a failure to grasp the underlying transformation logic. The model outputs hardcoded grids instead of a transformed grid. This suggests that the core logic is not being correctly applied or that the pattern extracted is nonexistent/incorrectly extrapolated. The output looks very much like the system has hardcoded the response.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The provided code snippet reveals an attempt to extract subgrids of size 4x4 and then select a specific element (block[1][1]) for each subgrid to create the transformed grid. However, there are several potential problems:\n    *   The code assumes the input grid dimensions are multiples of 4, which may not always be the case. This could lead to index errors or unexpected behavior if the input grid is not divisible by 4.\n    *   The logic only uses the element at position [1][1] of each 4x4 block. This might be too simplistic to capture the complex transformations in other grid transformation tasks.\n    *   There is no error handling or input validation, making the code fragile.\n    *   It is unclear from the provided information what the model does with the transformed_grid after it is created. There is no further processing or output of the result, which is an unusual omission.\n\nOverall, the execution analysis highlights significant shortcomings in the system's pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, and generalisation abilities.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a rudimentary ability to generate code and attempt pattern recognition. However, its ability to accurately and consistently transform grids based on training examples is severely limited. The system struggles to generalize from training data and often produces incorrect output grids. The system's overall capability is considered **poor**, with an accuracy of only 33%.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation:** The system can generate Python code to manipulate grids, demonstrating a basic understanding of programming principles and grid structures.\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Attempt):** The system attempts to identify patterns from training examples, showing an intention to solve the task. Even though the model seems to misinterpret the patterns and the answers are completely wrong, the model attempts to identify patterns.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization:** The system's primary weakness is its inability to generalize from training examples to novel test cases. It often overfits to the provided examples without understanding the core transformation principle.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The system lacks a robust understanding of spatial relationships and how changes in one part of the grid affect other parts.\n*   **Lack of Abstract Reasoning:** The system seems to focus on surface-level similarities without grasping the underlying transformation logic.\n*   **Incorrect Logic:** The logic implemented is likely a misunderstanding of the prompt and it is also too simplistic to capture the complex transformations in other grid transformation tasks.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most crucial capability to improve is **Pattern Generalization**. The system must learn to extract and apply abstract transformation logic rather than relying on superficial pattern matching.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Pattern Abstraction Layer:** Introduce an intermediate layer where patterns are explicitly represented as rules or functions. This enables more systematic rule application and facilitates easier generalization to new inputs. Focus on how the abstraction layer would specifically interpret the grid examples.\n\n2.  **Explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Given the grid-based nature of the problem, CNNs are often effective for spatial feature extraction and complex pattern learning. Train a CNN to predict the output grid based on the input grid and training examples. This approach is particularly promising if the underlying transformations involve spatial patterns. Ensure you are providing the CNN with adequate training data.\n\n3.  **Implement a Rule-Based System:** Use a rule-based system to represent the transformation logic. The system can learn rules from the training examples and apply them to the test input.\n\n4.  **Enhanced Debugging with Intermediate Print Statements:** Add extensive `print` statements within the transformation logic, especially during the pattern extraction and rule application stages. This will enable detailed tracking of intermediate values and reveal where the system is deviating from the correct path.\n\n5.  **Improve Transformation Logic:** Review the current transformation logic and refine it to better capture the core patterns in the training data. Consider incorporating more sophisticated techniques for detecting and applying transformation rules, such as spatial reasoning algorithms or constraint satisfaction methods.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable-to-declining**. While the system shows some initial understanding of programming principles and pattern recognition, its inability to generalize and apply the extracted patterns accurately results in consistently incorrect outputs. Without significant improvements in pattern generalization and spatial reasoning, the system's capabilities are likely to remain limited.\n",

These algorithms should be able to identify spatial relationships, dependencies between elements, and the overall transformation logic.\n*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Implement mechanisms to ensure that the generated solutions satisfy the inherent constraints of the grid structure and the identified transformation rules.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Enhance the system's spatial reasoning capabilities to better understand how changes in one part of the grid affect other parts and to ensure consistent application of transformation rules.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce a Pattern Abstraction Layer:** Instead of directly translating the input grids into output grids, introduce an intermediate layer where patterns are explicitly represented as rules or functions. This allows for more systematic application of the rules and easier generalization to new inputs.\n\n2.  **Implement a Rule-Based System:** Use a rule-based system to represent the transformation logic.

Train a CNN to predict the output grid based on the input grid and the training examples.\n\n4.  **Add Intermediate Print Statements:** Insert `print` statements within the core logic to track intermediate values and the program's reasoning steps. This will help in debugging and identifying where the system is going wrong. For example, in `transform_grid`, print the `block` variable to see the extracted subgrid.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n**Sample ID 0:**\n\n*   information_extraction: Failed to correctly understand the pattern of '2' placement.\n*   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect grid.\n\n**Sample ID 1:**\n\n*   information_extraction: Failed to accurately extract the overall transformation pattern, specifically where '2's and '8's should be placed.\n*   solution_generation: Generated an incorrect grid based on the misidentified pattern.\n",

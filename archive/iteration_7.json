  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLM-based decomposition and targeted retrieval to answer factual questions. It decomposes the question into known and unknown parts, generates a targeted search query based on the unknown information, simulates retrieval, and extracts a concise answer, then validates if the extracted answer answers the question. The LLM acts as an expert at breaking down questions, generating targeted search queries, concise answer extraction, and as an expert validator.\n\nThe functions used are:\n- `call_llm`: Calls the Gemini API with a given prompt and optional system instruction.\n- `main`: Orchestrates the question-answering process by decomposing the question, generating a targeted query, simulating retrieval, extracting the answer, and validating it.\n\nThe overall workflow involves `main` calling `call_llm` multiple times to perform decomposition, query generation, answer extraction, and validation, with the results of each call influencing the subsequent steps.",

However, the phrases \"No information provided.\", \"I am sorry, I cannot provide an answer as there was no search result found.\", and \"Could not be validated. Not an answer.\" suggest underlying issues, potentially related to information retrieval and validation. These aren't traditional runtime errors, but rather indicators of failed logic or lack of sufficient data.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n*   **Decomposition:** The system attempts to break down the question into known and unknown components, which is a good strategy for complex questions.\n*   **Targeted Query Generation:** The system attempts to generate specific queries to find the information needed.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n*   **Information Retrieval Failure:** The system frequently fails to retrieve the necessary information to answer the question, as evidenced by the \"No information provided\" and similar messages.\n*   **Validation Failure:** The system often flags answers as \"Could not be validated. Not an answer,\" even when a valid answer exists. This indicates a problem with the validation logic or a misunderstanding of the expected answer format.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Information Retrieval:** The inability to retrieve relevant information is the primary bottleneck. The generated search queries might be ineffective, or the system might not have access to the necessary knowledge sources.\n*   **Answer Validation:** The validation process appears overly strict or flawed, leading to the rejection of potentially correct answers.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system seems to struggle with understanding the context of the question and generating appropriate search queries. For example, in sample 0, it fails to find the death date of Lillian Marie Bounds' father. A better query might include \"Lillian Marie Bounds biography\" to find related information.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Single Queries:** The system often relies on a single query and doesn't seem to iterate or refine the query if the initial search fails.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe single most critical problem is the **ineffective information retrieval** due to poorly constructed queries and a lack of iterative search refinement. This leads to an inability to find the required information to answer the questions, regardless of the complexity of the question decomposition logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Improve the query generation process to create more effective and nuanced search queries. Implement a mechanism for iterative query refinement, where the system analyzes the results of the initial query and adjusts the query accordingly.\n*   **Answer Validation:** Review and refine the answer validation logic to ensure it is not overly strict and correctly identifies valid answers. Consider using a more flexible validation approach that can handle slight variations in answer format.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Enhance Query Generation:**\n    *   Implement a broader range of query generation strategies, including using keywords from the question, identifying key entities, and incorporating related terms.\n    *   Add a component that analyzes the question type and tailors the query generation strategy accordingly (e.g., date-related questions should generate queries that specifically target dates).\n2.  **Implement Iterative Query Refinement:**\n    *   After the initial query, analyze the search results (even if no direct answer is found).\n    *   If no direct answer is found, modify the query based on the initial results. This could involve adding related terms, removing less relevant terms, or trying different search engines.\n    *   Set a maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops.\n3.  **Revise Answer Validation:**\n    *   Relax the validation criteria to allow for slight variations in answer format. For example, allow \"March, 2001\" and \"March 2001\" to be considered equivalent.\n    *   Implement a confidence score for each extracted answer and only reject answers with very low confidence scores.\n4. Add more intermediate steps with print statements to the underlying code. If you can see the intermediate steps that are executed, you will have a better idea of what is going wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 0:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample 2:** information_extraction\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe execution outputs clearly demonstrate a consistent failure in information retrieval and answer validation. The system correctly decomposes the questions into known and unknown components and formulates a targeted query. However, it consistently fails to find the answer to the query, resulting in \"No information provided\" or similar messages. The subsequent answer validation step invariably rejects the extracted \"answer\" (which is essentially no answer at all).\n\n*   **Query Formulation:** While the queries seem relevant at first glance, they lack nuance and depth. They appear to be directly concatenating keywords without considering semantic relationships or alternative phrasing.\n*   **Lack of Iteration:** The system makes a single query attempt and does not iterate or refine its approach even when the initial query fails.\n*   **Answer Validation Rigidity:** The validation process is excessively strict, immediately rejecting responses like \"No information provided\" instead of potentially flagging them for further processing or alternative query attempts. The system fails to identify a lack of information as a failure state which requires a different approach.\n*   **Error Messaging:** The error messages are informative to a degree, but could be more specific. Instead of \"No information provided,\" it could indicate *why* no information was provided (e.g., \"No results found for query: X\").\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic capability for question decomposition and query generation. However, its overall capability is severely hampered by ineffective information retrieval and overly strict answer validation. The system essentially fails to provide any useful answers. Therefore, its ability to answer real-world questions is currently non-existent.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Question Decomposition:** Ability to break down questions into known and unknown components.\n*   **Targeted Query Generation:** Attempts to generate specific queries based on the unknown information.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Information Retrieval Failure:** Consistently fails to retrieve relevant information.\n*   **Overly Strict Answer Validation:** Rejects potentially valid (or at least non-error) responses.\n*   **Lack of Iterative Search:** Doesn't refine queries or try alternative search strategies when initial searches fail.\n*   **Poor Contextual Understanding:** Struggles to understand the nuances of the questions and generate appropriate search terms.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **information retrieval**. Without the ability to reliably retrieve relevant information, the system is fundamentally unable to answer questions.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Advanced Query Generation Techniques:**\n    *   **Semantic Expansion:** Use techniques like word embeddings or knowledge graphs to expand queries with synonyms and related terms. For example, for \"Lillian Marie Bounds father death date,\" add terms like \"Lillian Disney's father,\" \"Lillian Bounds' father passing,\" etc.\n    *   **Contextual Analysis:** Implement a mechanism to analyze the type of question being asked (e.g., biographical, historical, scientific) and tailor the query generation strategy accordingly.\n    *   **Entity Recognition:** Utilize named entity recognition (NER) to identify key entities in the question and explicitly include them in the query.\n\n2.  **Develop Iterative Query Refinement:**\n    *   **Result Analysis:** After the initial query, analyze the search results (even if no direct answer is found). Look for patterns, relevant terms, or clues that can be used to refine the query.\n    *   **Query Modification:** Implement a process for modifying the query based on the initial results. This could involve adding related terms, removing less relevant terms, or trying different search engines.\n    *   **Multi-Query Approach:** Explore using multiple queries with slightly different formulations in parallel and combining the results.\n    *   **Example:** If the first query for \"Lillian Marie Bounds father death date\" returns results about her marriage to Walt Disney, the next query could be \"Lillian Marie Bounds biography Walt Disney marriage family.\"\n\n3.  **Refine Answer Validation Logic:**\n    *   **Relax Strictness:** Reduce the stringency of the validation criteria. Allow for minor variations in answer format and tolerate less-than-perfect matches.\n    *   **Confidence Scoring:** Implement a confidence scoring mechanism to evaluate the reliability of the extracted answer. Only reject answers with very low confidence scores.\n    *   **Reasoning over Candidates:** Validate not just by direct matching, but also by reasoning about whether a candidate answer is plausible given what the system already knows. For example, if the system knows someone was born in 1900, and a query suggests they died in 1850, that should be flagged as an anomaly.\n    *   **Handle No-Answer Cases Gracefully:** If the system truly cannot find an answer, return a well-formatted \"No Answer Found\" response instead of just failing validation.\n\n4.  **Increase Code Visibility:**\n    *   Add print statements at each step (query generation, search, validation) so you can observe the internal state and troubleshoot issues easier.\n    *   Use a debugger to step through the code and inspect the values of variables.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nCurrently, the capabilities are **stable but poor**. The system consistently fails to answer questions. Implementing the above recommendations should lead to a significant improvement in information retrieval and overall performance, thereby improving the trend.\n",

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nNo explicit runtime errors like JSONDecodeError or TypeError are present in the provided outputs. However, the phrases \"No information provided.\", \"I am sorry, I cannot provide an answer as there was no search result found.\", and \"Could not be validated. Not an answer.\" suggest underlying issues, potentially related to information retrieval and validation. These aren't traditional runtime errors, but rather indicators of failed logic or lack of sufficient data.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n*   **Decomposition:** The system attempts to break down the question into known and unknown components, which is a good strategy for complex questions.\n*   **Targeted Query Generation:** The system attempts to generate specific queries to find the information needed.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n*   **Information Retrieval Failure:** The system frequently fails to retrieve the necessary information to answer the question, as evidenced by the \"No information provided\" and similar messages.\n*   **Validation Failure:** The system often flags answers as \"Could not be validated. Not an answer,\" even when a valid answer exists. This indicates a problem with the validation logic or a misunderstanding of the expected answer format.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Information Retrieval:** The inability to retrieve relevant information is the primary bottleneck. The generated search queries might be ineffective, or the system might not have access to the necessary knowledge sources.\n*   **Answer Validation:** The validation process appears overly strict or flawed, leading to the rejection of potentially correct answers.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The system seems to struggle with understanding the context of the question and generating appropriate search queries. For example, in sample 0, it fails to find the death date of Lillian Marie Bounds' father. A better query might include \"Lillian Marie Bounds biography\" to find related information.\n*   **Over-Reliance on Single Queries:** The system often relies on a single query and doesn't seem to iterate or refine the query if the initial search fails.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe single most critical problem is the **ineffective information retrieval** due to poorly constructed queries and a lack of iterative search refinement. This leads to an inability to find the required information to answer the questions, regardless of the complexity of the question decomposition logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Improve the query generation process to create more effective and nuanced search queries. Implement a mechanism for iterative query refinement, where the system analyzes the results of the initial query and adjusts the query accordingly.\n*   **Answer Validation:** Review and refine the answer validation logic to ensure it is not overly strict and correctly identifies valid answers. Consider using a more flexible validation approach that can handle slight variations in answer format.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Enhance Query Generation:**\n    *   Implement a broader range of query generation strategies, including using keywords from the question, identifying key entities, and incorporating related terms.\n    *   Add a component that analyzes the question type and tailors the query generation strategy accordingly (e.g., date-related questions should generate queries that specifically target dates).\n2.  **Implement Iterative Query Refinement:**\n    *   After the initial query, analyze the search results (even if no direct answer is found).\n    *   If no direct answer is found, modify the query based on the initial results. This could involve adding related terms, removing less relevant terms, or trying different search engines.\n    *   Set a maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops.\n3.  **Revise Answer Validation:**\n    *   Relax the validation criteria to allow for slight variations in answer format. For example, allow \"March, 2001\" and \"March 2001\" to be considered equivalent.\n    *   Implement a confidence score for each extracted answer and only reject answers with very low confidence scores.\n4. Add more intermediate steps with print statements to the underlying code. If you can see the intermediate steps that are executed, you will have a better idea of what is going wrong.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 0:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction\n*   **Sample 2:** information_extraction\n",

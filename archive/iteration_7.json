It uses two LLM-based agents: a \"Solution Proposer\" and a \"Solution Critic,\" who iteratively propose and critique solutions.

The main function orchestrates this debate, calling `call_llm` for both agent roles and the refinement step, and returns the final answer.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided information.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs suggest the AI system is performing well, exhibiting an accuracy of 1.00 (5/5) with no reported errors.  The examples provided demonstrate proficiency in numerical reasoning, information retrieval, and contextual understanding.  However, the *lack* of error samples is a significant limitation.  Without observing failure cases, it's impossible to truly understand the system's boundaries and vulnerabilities. The given sample outputs are too limited for a complete analysis of all edge cases.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system appears to possess strong capabilities in the domains tested.  It can accurately extract relevant information, perform calculations, and answer questions based on the provided context. However, the assessment is incomplete due to the absence of failure examples. The overall capability is *potentially* high, but the confidence level is low due to the limited scope of testing.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accurate Information Extraction and Numerical Reasoning:**  The system reliably extracts key facts and performs calculations. Maintain this accuracy by rigorous testing with new data.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** The system correctly interprets context (e.g., recognizing \"millions\" as units) which is crucial.\n*   **Seemingly Flawless Performance (within the tested domain):** The system is performing extremely well so far.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Error Data:** This is the most critical weakness.  Without error examples, it's impossible to identify failure modes, edge cases, or potential biases. This also means we are unable to map capability failures.\n*   **Limited Generalizability:** The small dataset makes it difficult to generalize performance characteristics. The model may overfit to the training data (if it was even trained).\n*   **Uncertainty about Robustness:** It's unknown how the system handles noisy, ambiguous, or contradictory information, given the perfect performance.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Error Identification and Analysis.**  We need to actively seek out and analyze failure cases to understand the system's limitations. This means finding edge cases or writing code specifically to search for these kinds of errors.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Data Augmentation with Negative Examples:**  Develop a strategy for generating negative examples. This could involve:\n    *   **Adversarial Question Generation:**  Create questions designed to confuse the system (e.g., questions with irrelevant information, ambiguous wording, or requiring complex inferences).\n    *   **Introducing Noise:**  Add noise to the input data (e.g., typos, incorrect numbers, or contradictory statements) to test the system's robustness.\n    *   **Using slightly different prompts for data generation and seeing which ones the model fails on.**\n2.  **Implement Detailed Logging and Debugging:**\n    *   Log the intermediate steps of the reasoning process (e.g., extracted facts, calculated values, and decision-making steps).\n    *   Add print statements or debugging tools to allow developers to trace the execution flow and identify failure points.\n3.  **Develop Fuzz Testing Techniques:**\n    *   Randomly generate inputs to test the boundaries of the system's capabilities.\n    *   Focus on edge cases and boundary conditions that are likely to cause errors.\n4.  **Targeted Metric Implementation:**\n    *   Create metrics that measure the accuracy of information extraction, reasoning, and answer generation separately. This is especially important if the overall accuracy is high, but specific components might be weak.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **stable but with a significant caveat.**  The system appears to be performing consistently well, but the lack of error analysis prevents a true assessment of its potential for growth or decline.  Until failure modes are understood and addressed, the system's true capabilities remain unknown, and any perceived \"stability\" could be misleading. We have not identified any areas that are declining or improving because we have not seen the model in use with our own eyes.\n",

Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.\n2.  **Collect More Data with Negative Examples**: Generate a diverse set of question-answer pairs that include both correct and incorrect answers to expose potential weaknesses in the system's reasoning. Make sure there are many more examples of incorrect answsers such that debugging and error analysis can be more effectively performed.\n3.  **Develop Targeted Evaluation Metrics**: Implement specific evaluation metrics that measure the accuracy of information extraction, constraint handling, solution generation, and solution verification to identify areas for improvement.\n4.  **Fuzz Testing**: Fuzz test the input to see if there are any edge cases where your model might fail.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nSince there are no error cases, there are no capability failures to map.\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report based on the provided information.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs suggest the AI system is performing well, exhibiting an accuracy of 1.00 (5/5) with no reported errors.  The examples provided demonstrate proficiency in numerical reasoning, information retrieval, and contextual understanding.  However, the *lack* of error samples is a significant limitation.  Without observing failure cases, it's impossible to truly understand the system's boundaries and vulnerabilities. The given sample outputs are too limited for a complete analysis of all edge cases.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system appears to possess strong capabilities in the domains tested.  It can accurately extract relevant information, perform calculations, and answer questions based on the provided context. However, the assessment is incomplete due to the absence of failure examples. The overall capability is *potentially* high, but the confidence level is low due to the limited scope of testing.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Accurate Information Extraction and Numerical Reasoning:**  The system reliably extracts key facts and performs calculations. Maintain this accuracy by rigorous testing with new data.\n*   **Contextual Understanding:** The system correctly interprets context (e.g., recognizing \"millions\" as units) which is crucial.\n*   **Seemingly Flawless Performance (within the tested domain):** The system is performing extremely well so far.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Lack of Error Data:** This is the most critical weakness.  Without error examples, it's impossible to identify failure modes, edge cases, or potential biases. This also means we are unable to map capability failures.\n*   **Limited Generalizability:** The small dataset makes it difficult to generalize performance characteristics. The model may overfit to the training data (if it was even trained).\n*   **Uncertainty about Robustness:** It's unknown how the system handles noisy, ambiguous, or contradictory information, given the perfect performance.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Error Identification and Analysis.**  We need to actively seek out and analyze failure cases to understand the system's limitations. This means finding edge cases or writing code specifically to search for these kinds of errors.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Data Augmentation with Negative Examples:**  Develop a strategy for generating negative examples. This could involve:\n    *   **Adversarial Question Generation:**  Create questions designed to confuse the system (e.g., questions with irrelevant information, ambiguous wording, or requiring complex inferences).\n    *   **Introducing Noise:**  Add noise to the input data (e.g., typos, incorrect numbers, or contradictory statements) to test the system's robustness.\n    *   **Using slightly different prompts for data generation and seeing which ones the model fails on.**\n2.  **Implement Detailed Logging and Debugging:**\n    *   Log the intermediate steps of the reasoning process (e.g., extracted facts, calculated values, and decision-making steps).\n    *   Add print statements or debugging tools to allow developers to trace the execution flow and identify failure points.\n3.  **Develop Fuzz Testing Techniques:**\n    *   Randomly generate inputs to test the boundaries of the system's capabilities.\n    *   Focus on edge cases and boundary conditions that are likely to cause errors.\n4.  **Targeted Metric Implementation:**\n    *   Create metrics that measure the accuracy of information extraction, reasoning, and answer generation separately. This is especially important if the overall accuracy is high, but specific components might be weak.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **stable but with a significant caveat.**  The system appears to be performing consistently well, but the lack of error analysis prevents a true assessment of its potential for growth or decline.  Until failure modes are understood and addressed, the system's true capabilities remain unknown, and any perceived \"stability\" could be misleading. We have not identified any areas that are declining or improving because we have not seen the model in use with our own eyes.\n"

        "output": "Initial Question: PASSAGE: Several crusades were called against Bosnia, a country long deemed infested with heresy by both the rest of Catholic Europe and its Eastern Orthodox neighbours. The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \"Cathar antipope\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia. The same year, Ban Matthew Ninoslav abandoned an unspecified heresy, but this did not satisfy Gregory.\n\nQUESTION: Who was Pope Honorius III's replacement?\nFinal Answer: Pope Gregory IX\n\nANSWER_START\nPope Gregory IX\n\nANSWER_END\n",

They also no longer controlled their playoff destiny, needing to win their final three games of the season, and also losses by other AFC teams to have a chance for a wild card. Pittsburgh would strike on their first play of the game when Ben Roethlisberger hit a wide-open Mike Wallace for a 60-yard TD pass.  Green Bay would answer with an 83-yard strike from Aaron Rodgers to Greg Jennings for a TD.  The Steelers would cap the 1st quarter with a 2-yard TD run by Rashard Mendenhall.  In the 2nd quarter, QB Aaron Rodgers was able to scramble out of the pocket for a 14-yard TD run.  Ben Roethlisberger would hit Mewelde Moore for a 10-yard TD pass in the final seconds of the 1st Half and the Steelers would take a 21-14 lead into halftime with them. The 2nd half got off to a slow start for both teams.  Jeff Reed would kick a 37-yard field goal, the only scoring of the 3rd quarter.  In the 4th quarter, it became a shootout between both quarterbacks.  Aaron Rodgers would hit Jermichael Finley for an 11-yard TD pass.  The Steelers answered with a 34-yard field goal, but would lose the lead for the first time in the game when Ryan Grant rushed for a 24-yard score, putting Green Bay up 28-27.  The Steelers would once again answer with a 43-yard field goal, but Aaron Rodgers would complete a 24-yard TD pass to James Jones and follow it with a successful 2-point conversion attempt.  The Steelers, down 36-30, would get the ball back with just 2&#160;minutes left in the game.  With just 3&#160;seconds remaining, Ben Roethlisberger would hit Mike Wallace in the left sideline of the endzone (in a TD pass that resembled the Super Bowl-winning catch by Santonio Holmes back in February) and the extra point was good, giving the Steelers a last-second 37-36 win over the Packers. Ben Roethlisberger would finish with a record-setting game, going 29/46 for 503&#160;yards and 3 TD passes.

To attack Washington's defense, Jeff Joniak stated the Bears should utilize Jordan Howard; Howard, who was approaching 1,200 rushing yards on the season, took on a Redskins run defense that ranked 27th in percentage of runs at least four yards and 30th in first down run defense with 4.98 yards per carry. As for Chicago's defense, it faced a Washington offense that ranked third in the league. It also contained plenty of speed with players like receivers DeSean Jackson, who recorded three 100-yard games in the last four; Jamison Crowder, who led the Redskins with seven receiving touchdowns; Pierre Gar&#231;on, who led the team with 71 catches; tight ends Jordan Reed and Vernon Davis combined for 104 catches and seven touchdowns. Joniak added the run defense, who struggled against the Packers last week, needed to watch running back Rob Kelly, who ran for 137 yards against Green Bay five weeks earlier. Joniak also wrote the Bears had provided a challenge for playoff-contending teams, and one like the Redskins, who were \"on a short week, off a loss and on the road,\" was \"susceptible against the feisty Bears.\" Chris Thompson scored the first points of the game for the Redskins with a seven-yard touchdown run. Matt Barkley attempted to lead the Bears in response, spurred by 18-yard passes to Deonte Thompson and Alshon Jeffery along with Howard's 23-yard run. However, Barkley threw two incomplete passes, which resulted in Connor Barth attempting a 22-yard field goal, but the kick was blocked by Preston Smith. Thompson ran for a 17-yard touchdown on the next drive; when Chicago entered Washington territory once again, Barkley's pass for Josh Bellamy went into triple coverage and was intercepted by Bashaud Breeland at the one-yard line. Dustin Hopkins later kicked a 29-yard field goal. The next three drives of the game ended with a touchdown: Jeremy Langford ran for a one-yard touchdown, Kirk Cousins recorded a nine-yard touchdown run and Barkley threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Meredith. Barkley struggled early in the second half when he threw interceptions on each of the Bears' first four drives of the half to Josh Norman (twice), Breeland and Will Blackmon; the Redskins converted two of the picks into scores with Cousins' one-yard touchdown run and Hopkins' 20-yard field goal. Although Barkley threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Thompson, Mack Brown's 61-yard touchdown run increased the margin between the two teams to 20 points as the Bears lost 41-21. With the loss, the Bears fell to 3-12 for the first time since the NFL expanded to 16 games in 1978.

Local Qing administration, unable to cope with the rebels, suggested making a kind of agreement with them, but the Qianlong Emperor recalled the previous commanders and appointed Zhang Guangsi, an experienced officer under Ortai, to quell the rebellion. The uprising was bloodily suppressed, the last rebels doggedly fighting at Niupidajing. Altogether Qing armies destroyed approximately 1200 Miao forts and killed over 18,000 warriors.

On 30 August 1917, an eclectic band of political prisoners, common criminals and insubordinate prison guards mutinied at the Thai Nguyen Penitentiary, the largest one in the region.

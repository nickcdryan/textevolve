  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings by first extracting structured meeting information using `extract_structured_meeting_info`, which uses the LLM to parse the input question and return a JSON object with meeting details, reprompting if the JSON is invalid. Then, `find_meeting_slot_with_react` employs the ReAct pattern to find a valid meeting slot by alternating between reasoning and proposing slots until a valid one is found or it determines no such slot exists. The `call_llm` function handles the interaction with the LLM, and the `main` function orchestrates the entire process. The workflow consists of extracting meeting information, finding a suitable slot using ReAct, and returning the result.",

      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nAcross all provided error cases, the primary runtime error is a failure to extract meeting information, leading to a generic \"Error extracting meeting information.\" response. This suggests a critical breakdown in the initial information_extraction phase. No specific exceptions like JSONDecodeError or TypeError are explicitly mentioned in the provided `error_message` or `output` fields. However, the consistent failure to extract information *implies* the presence of underlying parsing or extraction errors within the system, likely related to string manipulation, pattern matching, or data structure construction.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nWithout access to the system's code, it's difficult to pinpoint strengths definitively. However, based on the problem description, we can infer:\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The system seems to correctly identify the problem as a meeting scheduling task.\n2. **Constraint Identification**: The problem description mentions the capability to handle constraints, which is a potential strength *if* it works in other cases.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Information Extraction**: The most glaring weakness is the inability to reliably extract information from the problem statement, leading to a complete failure in subsequent steps. The system consistently returns \"Error extracting meeting information,\" indicating a fundamental flaw in this capability.\n2. **Lack of Robust Error Handling**: The error handling is too generic. Instead of providing more granular error messages, it always returns \"Error extracting meeting information.\" This hinders debugging and targeted improvements.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Information Extraction Failure**: The system's inability to extract key details like participant names, available time slots, and constraints is a critical bottleneck that prevents any meaningful progress.\n2. **Lack of Granular Error Reporting**:  The blanket \"Error extracting meeting information\" message provides no insight into the specific cause of the failure. This lack of detailed error reporting makes debugging extremely difficult.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe consistent error message \"Error extracting meeting information\" across all samples points to a systemic issue within the information extraction module. This suggests the extraction logic is either too brittle (e.g., relies on rigid regex patterns) or is not handling variations in the input format effectively.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **fragility of the information extraction process**. The system likely relies on a rigid parsing mechanism that fails when the input deviates slightly from the expected format or structure. This results in a complete inability to extract the necessary data for meeting scheduling.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Information Extraction**: This capability requires significant improvement. The system needs a more robust and adaptable method for extracting information from the problem statement.\n2. **Error Reporting**: The error reporting needs to be more granular and informative.  Specific error messages should indicate the exact reason for the extraction failure (e.g., \"Failed to parse participant list,\" \"Invalid time format found,\" etc.).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Transition to LLM-Driven Information Extraction:** Instead of relying on brittle regex-based parsing, leverage the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs. Use LLM calls to extract entities and relationships. For example: `extract_information(text, \"What are the names of all participants mentioned?\")`.\n2. **Implement a Verification Loop for Information Extraction:** After extracting information, implement a verification step to ensure the extracted data is complete and accurate. If verification fails, re-process with specific feedback.\n3. **Use Few-Shot Learning for Information Extraction:** Provide the LLM with several examples of how to extract information from different problem statements. This will improve the LLM's ability to handle variations in the input format.\n4. **Implement More Granular Error Reporting:** Replace the generic \"Error extracting meeting information\" message with more specific error messages that indicate the exact reason for the failure. This will make it easier to debug and identify the root cause of the problem. Examples:  \"Failed to parse participant list due to invalid format,\" or \"Could not find available time slots for participant X.\"\n5. **Implement Input Validation:** Before attempting to extract information, validate the input to ensure it conforms to the expected format. This can help to identify and handle malformed inputs gracefully.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 0**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 1**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 2**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 3**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 4**: information\\_extraction\n",

Every sample execution resulted in the error message \"Error extracting meeting information.\" This confirms the complete failure of the information extraction process across all input samples. There is no variation in the error message, indicating that the same code path and error handling are triggered regardless of the input. The absence of any successful executions strongly suggests a fundamental flaw rather than an intermittent or input-specific issue. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags suggest a defined output format, but even this basic structure is only populated with error messages, highlighting the depth of the problem.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates extremely limited capabilities. While it can apparently identify the task as a meeting scheduling one and likely has some code for constraint handling (as inferred from the initial report), the complete failure of information extraction renders the system non-functional. The actual scheduling logic, constraint application, and meeting time generation are never reached. The system, as it stands, has virtually no demonstrable value in its current state.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Potential Problem Understanding:** The system appears to correctly identify the overall task.\n*   **Potential Constraint Handling:** The existence of code for constraint handling is a potential strength, but currently untested.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Critical Information Extraction Failure:** The inability to extract meeting details is a complete roadblock.\n*   **Poor Error Handling & Reporting:** The generic error message provides no useful information for debugging and improvement.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** The system is brittle and unable to handle variations in input.\n*   **Zero Accuracy:** The system achieves 0% accuracy on the provided sample set.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. Addressing this is a prerequisite for any other functionality to work.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction (High Priority):** Replace the existing parsing mechanism with an LLM-based approach. Use a prompt that instructs the LLM to extract key information such as participant names, available time slots, and constraints. This is *critical* and needs immediate attention.\n2.  **Implement a Verification Loop for Information Extraction (High Priority):** After extracting the information, verify the extracted data for completeness and correctness.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\nAcross all provided error cases, the primary runtime error is a failure to extract meeting information, leading to a generic \"Error extracting meeting information.\" response. This suggests a critical breakdown in the initial information_extraction phase. No specific exceptions like JSONDecodeError or TypeError are explicitly mentioned in the provided `error_message` or `output` fields. However, the consistent failure to extract information *implies* the presence of underlying parsing or extraction errors within the system, likely related to string manipulation, pattern matching, or data structure construction.\n\n## STRENGTHS\nWithout access to the system's code, it's difficult to pinpoint strengths definitively. However, based on the problem description, we can infer:\n1. **Problem Understanding**: The system seems to correctly identify the problem as a meeting scheduling task.\n2. **Constraint Identification**: The problem description mentions the capability to handle constraints, which is a potential strength *if* it works in other cases.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1. **Information Extraction**: The most glaring weakness is the inability to reliably extract information from the problem statement, leading to a complete failure in subsequent steps. The system consistently returns \"Error extracting meeting information,\" indicating a fundamental flaw in this capability.\n2. **Lack of Robust Error Handling**: The error handling is too generic. Instead of providing more granular error messages, it always returns \"Error extracting meeting information.\" This hinders debugging and targeted improvements.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1. **Information Extraction Failure**: The system's inability to extract key details like participant names, available time slots, and constraints is a critical bottleneck that prevents any meaningful progress.\n2. **Lack of Granular Error Reporting**:  The blanket \"Error extracting meeting information\" message provides no insight into the specific cause of the failure. This lack of detailed error reporting makes debugging extremely difficult.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe consistent error message \"Error extracting meeting information\" across all samples points to a systemic issue within the information extraction module. This suggests the extraction logic is either too brittle (e.g., relies on rigid regex patterns) or is not handling variations in the input format effectively.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **fragility of the information extraction process**. The system likely relies on a rigid parsing mechanism that fails when the input deviates slightly from the expected format or structure. This results in a complete inability to extract the necessary data for meeting scheduling.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1. **Information Extraction**: This capability requires significant improvement. The system needs a more robust and adaptable method for extracting information from the problem statement.\n2. **Error Reporting**: The error reporting needs to be more granular and informative.  Specific error messages should indicate the exact reason for the extraction failure (e.g., \"Failed to parse participant list,\" \"Invalid time format found,\" etc.).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Transition to LLM-Driven Information Extraction:** Instead of relying on brittle regex-based parsing, leverage the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs. Use LLM calls to extract entities and relationships. For example: `extract_information(text, \"What are the names of all participants mentioned?\")`.\n2. **Implement a Verification Loop for Information Extraction:** After extracting information, implement a verification step to ensure the extracted data is complete and accurate. If verification fails, re-process with specific feedback.\n3. **Use Few-Shot Learning for Information Extraction:** Provide the LLM with several examples of how to extract information from different problem statements. This will improve the LLM's ability to handle variations in the input format.\n4. **Implement More Granular Error Reporting:** Replace the generic \"Error extracting meeting information\" message with more specific error messages that indicate the exact reason for the failure. This will make it easier to debug and identify the root cause of the problem. Examples:  \"Failed to parse participant list due to invalid format,\" or \"Could not find available time slots for participant X.\"\n5. **Implement Input Validation:** Before attempting to extract information, validate the input to ensure it conforms to the expected format. This can help to identify and handle malformed inputs gracefully.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 0**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 1**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 2**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 3**: information\\_extraction\n*   **Sample 4**: information\\_extraction\n",
    "capability_report_text": "```\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs are consistent and uniformly negative. Every sample execution resulted in the error message \"Error extracting meeting information.\" This confirms the complete failure of the information extraction process across all input samples. There is no variation in the error message, indicating that the same code path and error handling are triggered regardless of the input. The absence of any successful executions strongly suggests a fundamental flaw rather than an intermittent or input-specific issue. The `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags suggest a defined output format, but even this basic structure is only populated with error messages, highlighting the depth of the problem.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates extremely limited capabilities. While it can apparently identify the task as a meeting scheduling one and likely has some code for constraint handling (as inferred from the initial report), the complete failure of information extraction renders the system non-functional. The actual scheduling logic, constraint application, and meeting time generation are never reached. The system, as it stands, has virtually no demonstrable value in its current state.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Potential Problem Understanding:** The system appears to correctly identify the overall task.\n*   **Potential Constraint Handling:** The existence of code for constraint handling is a potential strength, but currently untested.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Critical Information Extraction Failure:** The inability to extract meeting details is a complete roadblock.\n*   **Poor Error Handling & Reporting:** The generic error message provides no useful information for debugging and improvement.\n*   **Lack of Robustness:** The system is brittle and unable to handle variations in input.\n*   **Zero Accuracy:** The system achieves 0% accuracy on the provided sample set.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction**. Addressing this is a prerequisite for any other functionality to work.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction (High Priority):** Replace the existing parsing mechanism with an LLM-based approach. Use a prompt that instructs the LLM to extract key information such as participant names, available time slots, and constraints. This is *critical* and needs immediate attention.\n2.  **Implement a Verification Loop for Information Extraction (High Priority):** After extracting the information, verify the extracted data for completeness and correctness. If discrepancies are found, use the LLM to refine the extraction. Ensure a maximum retry limit to prevent infinite loops. This is vital for robustness.\n3.  **Provide Few-Shot Examples to the LLM (High Priority):** Seed the LLM with 3-5 diverse examples of meeting scheduling requests and their corresponding extracted information. This will improve the LLM's understanding of the task and its ability to generalize to different input formats.\n4.  **Refactor Error Reporting (High Priority):** Replace the generic error message with more specific and informative messages. Report *what* information failed to extract, and *why*. This will significantly accelerate debugging.\n5.  **Add basic Input Validation (Medium Priority):** Check for essential keywords or phrases in the input to ensure it resembles a meeting scheduling request. If the input is obviously malformed, return a helpful error message.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nThe capability trend is currently **Declining**. With a score of 0/5, the system shows no useful functionality in its current state. Unless the information extraction issue is addressed, the system will remain unusable.\n```"

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with verification to answer questions, first determining the question type (numerical or general) and then processing it accordingly. Numerical questions are processed by extracting numerical information and then calculating the answer, while general questions are processed by decomposing the question into sub-questions, extracting information based on those sub-questions, and synthesizing the answer. The agent roles include a question type identifier, numerical information extractor, calculator, and (implicitly) a question decomposer and answer synthesizer.\n\nThe functions used are: `main` which orchestrates the process, `determine_question_type` to identify the type of question, `process_numerical_question` and `process_general_question` to handle the different question types, `extract_numerical_info` to extract numerical values, `calculate_answer` to perform calculations, `decompose_question` to break down general questions, `extract_information` to gather relevant details, and `synthesize_answer` to formulate the final response. The `call_llm` function is called within each of these functions. The overall workflow involves determining the question type, processing it based on its type (numerical or general), and returning the answer or an error message if any step fails.",

    "error_analysis": {
      "text_report": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe predominant runtime error across all the error cases is: \"An unexpected error occurred: name 'call_llm' is not defined\". This indicates a fundamental issue with the code's structure or environment setup. The `call_llm` function, presumably responsible for interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM), is not accessible within the current execution context. This is a critical error that prevents the system from performing any reasoning or problem-solving.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nSince there are no success cases, it's difficult to identify any strengths. However, the fact that the system produces consistent error messages suggests a level of basic error handling. The consistent formatting of the output with ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END also shows some structure.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Dependency on Undefined Function:** The entire system hinges on the `call_llm` function, which is not defined or accessible, rendering the system completely non-functional.\n2.  **Lack of Fallback Mechanisms:** There are no fallback mechanisms to handle the error when `call_llm` is not available. The system simply throws an error and stops, rather than attempting alternative approaches or providing more informative error messages.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Missing `call_llm` Function:** The absence of a defined `call_llm` function is the primary and most critical bottleneck.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling and Robustness:** The system needs better error handling to gracefully manage unforeseen issues like missing functions and to provide more informative debugging messages.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe error pattern is consistent: every sample fails with the same \"name 'call_llm' is not defined\" error. This points to a systemic issue rather than individual problem-specific failures.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the undefined `call_llm` function. This function is presumably the core component responsible for interacting with the LLM, and its absence effectively disables the entire system. The definition or import of this function needs to be addressed immediately.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Function Definition/Import:** Ensure that the `call_llm` function is properly defined within the codebase or imported from a relevant module.\n2.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions like `NameError` when a function is not defined. Include informative error messages and consider fallback mechanisms (e.g., using a dummy function for testing purposes).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Verify Environment Setup:** Double-check the execution environment to ensure that all necessary dependencies and modules are installed and accessible. Specifically, confirm the availability of any external libraries or APIs required by the `call_llm` function.\n2.  **Implement a Stub `call_llm` Function:** Create a simple stub function for `call_llm` that returns a default response. This would allow the system to at least run without crashing and enable testing of other components. For example:\n    ```python\n    def call_llm(prompt):\n        print(f\"LLM Called with prompt: {prompt}\")  # for debugging\n        return \"I don't know.\"\n    ```\n    This provides basic functionality to test other parts of the system.\n3.  **Add Detailed Logging:** Implement logging throughout the codebase, especially within the `call_llm` function and its calling functions. This will allow for easier debugging and tracing of errors. Add print statements showing how the system is reasoning and what the intermediate outputs are. These can be removed later once the system is working.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nAll samples failed due to the same fundamental error, thus affecting all capabilities:\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 3:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 4:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 5:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 6:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 7:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 8:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 9:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your requirements.\n\n## AI System Capability Report\n\n**System Name:** (Please insert your system name here)\n**Date of Assessment:** 2024-10-27\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal a consistent and critical error: `name 'call_llm' is not defined`. This error occurs in every execution attempt and effectively prevents the system from performing any meaningful task. The presence of \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggests that the system is attempting to format an answer, but it fails before it can generate any content. The execution outputs indicate a fundamental flaw in the system's architecture, specifically the lack of a crucial function required for interacting with the LLM.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the system demonstrates **zero functional capability**. Due to the undefined `call_llm` function, it cannot perform any of its intended tasks. The system is entirely non-functional. It is important to clarify that \"capability\" refers to what the system *can* do; given the errors, it does nothing.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\nWhile the system is currently non-functional, the following can be considered potential strengths for future development:\n\n*   **Structured Output Formatting:** The presence of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` suggests that the system is designed to provide structured responses, a good foundation for future capabilities.\n*   **Consistent Error Reporting:** The system consistently reports the same error, which aids in pinpointing the root cause.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Missing `call_llm` Function:** This is the most critical weakness. The absence of this function renders the entire system useless.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** The system crashes upon encountering the `NameError`.  It needs more robust error handling to gracefully manage such exceptions.\n3.  **No Fallback Mechanisms:** There are no alternative pathways or default behaviors when the `call_llm` function is unavailable. The system doesn't attempt any other approach or provide more informative debugging output.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Functionality**. This means resolving the `call_llm` error and ensuring the system can execute its core task of interacting with an LLM. Without this, no other capabilities can be developed or evaluated.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Define or Import `call_llm`:**\n    *   **Priority:** IMMEDIATE.\n    *   **Action:** Locate the definition of the `call_llm` function. Ensure that the file containing the definition is in the correct location relative to the calling code. Alternatively, import the `call_llm` function from the appropriate module or library. If it relies on an external library, verify that the library is installed in the execution environment.\n    *   **Verification:** After implementing, run a simple test case to confirm that the `call_llm` function is accessible and callable.\n2.  **Implement Basic Error Handling:**\n    *   **Priority:** HIGH.\n    *   **Action:** Wrap the calls to `call_llm` within `try...except` blocks to catch `NameError` and other potential exceptions. Within the `except` block, log the error message (including traceback information) and return a default response (e.g., \"I'm sorry, I encountered an error.\"). This prevents the system from crashing and provides valuable debugging information.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        try:\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n        except NameError as e:\n            print(f\"Error: {e}\")  # Log the error\n            response = \"I'm sorry, I encountered an error.\" # Default response\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Unexpected error: {e}\")\n            response = \"I'm sorry, I encountered an unexpected error.\"\n        ```\n    *   **Verification:** Introduce a temporary error that would trigger the error handling and confirm that the correct exception is caught and handled gracefully.\n3.  **Create a Stub `call_llm` for Development:**\n    *   **Priority:** MEDIUM (If the actual `call_llm` is not immediately available).\n    *   **Action:** Create a placeholder or \"stub\" function for `call_llm` that accepts a prompt as input and returns a simple, pre-defined response (e.g., \"This is a placeholder response.\"). This will allow you to test the rest of the system's logic without requiring a working LLM connection.  This also allows you to control the response from the LLM during development and testing.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        def call_llm(prompt):\n            print(f\"DEBUG: call_llm called with prompt: {prompt}\")\n            return \"This is a placeholder response.\"\n        ```\n    *   **Verification:** Run test cases with the stub `call_llm` and verify that the rest of the system processes the placeholder response correctly.\n4.  **Implement Detailed Logging:**\n    *   **Priority:** MEDIUM\n    *   **Action:** Use the `logging` module to add detailed logging throughout the codebase, including function calls, variable values, and intermediate results.  Pay special attention to the entry and exit points of the `call_llm` function and the code that calls it. This will provide valuable insights into the system's behavior and facilitate debugging.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        import logging\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # Set the logging level to DEBUG\n\n        def some_function(input_data):\n            logging.debug(f\"Entering some_function with input: {input_data}\")\n            result = process_data(input_data)\n            logging.debug(f\"process_data returned: {result}\")\n            logging.debug(\"Exiting some_function\")\n            return result\n        ```\n    *   **Verification:** Analyze the log output for various test cases to identify the sequence of events leading to errors and to understand the system's control flow.\n\n### CAPABILITY MAPPING (Revised)\n\nSince all samples failed, the focus of the capability mapping is to track progress after fixing the `call_llm` error. Once `call_llm` is functional, use the following template to map the performance of the system on each sample across various capabilities:\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   constraint_handling: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   solution_generation: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   solution_verification: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   decision_making: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   constraint_handling: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   solution_generation: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   solution_verification: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   decision_making: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n*   ...and so on for all 10 samples\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **severely declining** due to the non-functional state of the system. Once the `call_llm` issue is resolved, track the performance on each sample across the different capabilities (information extraction, constraint handling, etc.) to determine if performance is improving, declining, or stable.\n\nThis comprehensive report provides a clear path forward. Addressing the `call_llm` issue is paramount, followed by improved error handling and logging. Remember to systematically test each improvement and track the results to ensure progress.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThe predominant runtime error across all the error cases is: \"An unexpected error occurred: name 'call_llm' is not defined\". This indicates a fundamental issue with the code's structure or environment setup. The `call_llm` function, presumably responsible for interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM), is not accessible within the current execution context. This is a critical error that prevents the system from performing any reasoning or problem-solving.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\nSince there are no success cases, it's difficult to identify any strengths. However, the fact that the system produces consistent error messages suggests a level of basic error handling. The consistent formatting of the output with ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END also shows some structure.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Dependency on Undefined Function:** The entire system hinges on the `call_llm` function, which is not defined or accessible, rendering the system completely non-functional.\n2.  **Lack of Fallback Mechanisms:** There are no fallback mechanisms to handle the error when `call_llm` is not available. The system simply throws an error and stops, rather than attempting alternative approaches or providing more informative error messages.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Missing `call_llm` Function:** The absence of a defined `call_llm` function is the primary and most critical bottleneck.\n2.  **Lack of Error Handling and Robustness:** The system needs better error handling to gracefully manage unforeseen issues like missing functions and to provide more informative debugging messages.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\nThe error pattern is consistent: every sample fails with the same \"name 'call_llm' is not defined\" error. This points to a systemic issue rather than individual problem-specific failures.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the undefined `call_llm` function. This function is presumably the core component responsible for interacting with the LLM, and its absence effectively disables the entire system. The definition or import of this function needs to be addressed immediately.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Function Definition/Import:** Ensure that the `call_llm` function is properly defined within the codebase or imported from a relevant module.\n2.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch exceptions like `NameError` when a function is not defined. Include informative error messages and consider fallback mechanisms (e.g., using a dummy function for testing purposes).\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Verify Environment Setup:** Double-check the execution environment to ensure that all necessary dependencies and modules are installed and accessible. Specifically, confirm the availability of any external libraries or APIs required by the `call_llm` function.\n2.  **Implement a Stub `call_llm` Function:** Create a simple stub function for `call_llm` that returns a default response. This would allow the system to at least run without crashing and enable testing of other components. For example:\n    ```python\n    def call_llm(prompt):\n        print(f\"LLM Called with prompt: {prompt}\")  # for debugging\n        return \"I don't know.\"\n    ```\n    This provides basic functionality to test other parts of the system.\n3.  **Add Detailed Logging:** Implement logging throughout the codebase, especially within the `call_llm` function and its calling functions. This will allow for easier debugging and tracing of errors. Add print statements showing how the system is reasoning and what the intermediate outputs are. These can be removed later once the system is working.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\nAll samples failed due to the same fundamental error, thus affecting all capabilities:\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 3:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 4:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 5:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 6:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 7:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 8:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n*   **Sample 9:**\n    *   information_extraction: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (due to `call_llm` error)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your requirements.\n\n## AI System Capability Report\n\n**System Name:** (Please insert your system name here)\n**Date of Assessment:** 2024-10-27\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal a consistent and critical error: `name 'call_llm' is not defined`. This error occurs in every execution attempt and effectively prevents the system from performing any meaningful task. The presence of \"ANSWER_START\" and \"ANSWER_END\" markers suggests that the system is attempting to format an answer, but it fails before it can generate any content. The execution outputs indicate a fundamental flaw in the system's architecture, specifically the lack of a crucial function required for interacting with the LLM.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nCurrently, the system demonstrates **zero functional capability**. Due to the undefined `call_llm` function, it cannot perform any of its intended tasks. The system is entirely non-functional. It is important to clarify that \"capability\" refers to what the system *can* do; given the errors, it does nothing.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\nWhile the system is currently non-functional, the following can be considered potential strengths for future development:\n\n*   **Structured Output Formatting:** The presence of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` suggests that the system is designed to provide structured responses, a good foundation for future capabilities.\n*   **Consistent Error Reporting:** The system consistently reports the same error, which aids in pinpointing the root cause.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Missing `call_llm` Function:** This is the most critical weakness. The absence of this function renders the entire system useless.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Error Handling:** The system crashes upon encountering the `NameError`.  It needs more robust error handling to gracefully manage such exceptions.\n3.  **No Fallback Mechanisms:** There are no alternative pathways or default behaviors when the `call_llm` function is unavailable. The system doesn't attempt any other approach or provide more informative debugging output.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Functionality**. This means resolving the `call_llm` error and ensuring the system can execute its core task of interacting with an LLM. Without this, no other capabilities can be developed or evaluated.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Define or Import `call_llm`:**\n    *   **Priority:** IMMEDIATE.\n    *   **Action:** Locate the definition of the `call_llm` function. Ensure that the file containing the definition is in the correct location relative to the calling code. Alternatively, import the `call_llm` function from the appropriate module or library. If it relies on an external library, verify that the library is installed in the execution environment.\n    *   **Verification:** After implementing, run a simple test case to confirm that the `call_llm` function is accessible and callable.\n2.  **Implement Basic Error Handling:**\n    *   **Priority:** HIGH.\n    *   **Action:** Wrap the calls to `call_llm` within `try...except` blocks to catch `NameError` and other potential exceptions. Within the `except` block, log the error message (including traceback information) and return a default response (e.g., \"I'm sorry, I encountered an error.\"). This prevents the system from crashing and provides valuable debugging information.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        try:\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n        except NameError as e:\n            print(f\"Error: {e}\")  # Log the error\n            response = \"I'm sorry, I encountered an error.\" # Default response\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Unexpected error: {e}\")\n            response = \"I'm sorry, I encountered an unexpected error.\"\n        ```\n    *   **Verification:** Introduce a temporary error that would trigger the error handling and confirm that the correct exception is caught and handled gracefully.\n3.  **Create a Stub `call_llm` for Development:**\n    *   **Priority:** MEDIUM (If the actual `call_llm` is not immediately available).\n    *   **Action:** Create a placeholder or \"stub\" function for `call_llm` that accepts a prompt as input and returns a simple, pre-defined response (e.g., \"This is a placeholder response.\"). This will allow you to test the rest of the system's logic without requiring a working LLM connection.  This also allows you to control the response from the LLM during development and testing.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        def call_llm(prompt):\n            print(f\"DEBUG: call_llm called with prompt: {prompt}\")\n            return \"This is a placeholder response.\"\n        ```\n    *   **Verification:** Run test cases with the stub `call_llm` and verify that the rest of the system processes the placeholder response correctly.\n4.  **Implement Detailed Logging:**\n    *   **Priority:** MEDIUM\n    *   **Action:** Use the `logging` module to add detailed logging throughout the codebase, including function calls, variable values, and intermediate results.  Pay special attention to the entry and exit points of the `call_llm` function and the code that calls it. This will provide valuable insights into the system's behavior and facilitate debugging.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```python\n        import logging\n        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # Set the logging level to DEBUG\n\n        def some_function(input_data):\n            logging.debug(f\"Entering some_function with input: {input_data}\")\n            result = process_data(input_data)\n            logging.debug(f\"process_data returned: {result}\")\n            logging.debug(\"Exiting some_function\")\n            return result\n        ```\n    *   **Verification:** Analyze the log output for various test cases to identify the sequence of events leading to errors and to understand the system's control flow.\n\n### CAPABILITY MAPPING (Revised)\n\nSince all samples failed, the focus of the capability mapping is to track progress after fixing the `call_llm` error. Once `call_llm` is functional, use the following template to map the performance of the system on each sample across various capabilities:\n\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   constraint_handling: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   solution_generation: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   solution_verification: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   decision_making: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n*   **Sample 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   constraint_handling: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   solution_generation: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   solution_verification: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n    *   decision_making: Pass/Fail (Reason: If Fail, explain why)\n*   ...and so on for all 10 samples\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **severely declining** due to the non-functional state of the system. Once the `call_llm` issue is resolved, track the performance on each sample across the different capabilities (information extraction, constraint handling, etc.) to determine if performance is improving, declining, or stable.\n\nThis comprehensive report provides a clear path forward. Addressing the `call_llm` issue is paramount, followed by improved error handling and logging. Remember to systematically test each improvement and track the results to ensure progress. Good luck!\n"

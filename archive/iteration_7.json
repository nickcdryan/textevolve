  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to answer questions by first determining the question type, then extracting relevant information, and finally generating the answer. The problem is decomposed into these three distinct steps, each handled by a separate function with an LLM call. There are three agent roles within the script: Question Type Classifier, Information Extractor, and Answer Generator.\n\nThe `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, and `generate_answer` sequentially. These functions use `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini LLM, passing prompts and system instructions to guide the LLM's responses.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: In 1616 the Venetians besieged Farra and Gradisca, and the archduke attacked from Gorizia and Lucinico. With three large culverins, four guns and three small culverins, Farra  repulsed the enemy artillery with heavy losses. The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano. In September, Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 . Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships and on land by the war in Mantua. Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj.\n\nQUESTION: How many Dutch and English warships were blocking Spanish support?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: On a windy, rainy Sunday the Seahawks hosted the Rams looking to take an effective 3 game lead in the division with a win. The Seahawks drove the ball easily on their first possession, moving to the Ram 1-yard line. After a false start penalty, Seneca Wallace was sacked and fumbled, and the Rams returned the ball 89 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks drove down the field again, this time maintaining possession to the endzone as Darrell Jackson caught a 3-yard TD pass. The lead would change hands 6 more times in the game. With the Rams holding a 16-14 lead in the fourth quarter, Rams coach Scott Linehan chose to challenge a call, nullifying a field goal. The challenge was upheld, but the Rams still faced a fourth down play. Instead of kicking another field goal to increase the lead, Linehan chose to go for a first down. The raucous Qwest Field rose to the occasion, and Rams FB Paul Smith could not hear the play call. Rather than run a pass route he stayed in the backfield to block, and Ram QB Marc Bulger's pass to double covered TE Klopfenstein fell incomplete. Nate Burleson returned a punt 90 yards for a touchdown and a 21-16 lead. After a Rams TD with 2:37 remaining, a series of penalties against St. Louis changed momentum. A holding penalty nullified a successful 2 point convert. The second attempt failed. A 15-yard personal foul was assessed on the subsequent kickoff, and Josh Scobey returned the ball to the Ram 49-yard line. With a short field and time on the clock, Seneca Wallace and Maurice Morris drove the Seahawks to the Ram 20-yard line, where Josh Brown kicked a game-winning field goal with 9 seconds remaining.

      "question": "PASSAGE: After falling to the Colts at home, the Texans visited Pittsburgh for the first time since 2008, doing battle on Monday night with the Pittsburgh Steelers. While the Texans defense held off the Steelers' offense, the offense managed to gain much-needed momentum in the 1st quarter, a place they had previously struggled. The Texans scored first with 5:55 left after Blue caught a pass from Fitzpatrick to lead 7-0. In the second quarter Ben Roethlisberger was sacked by Watt and fumbled the ball near midfield. Houston capitalized on the turnover with a Bullock 39 yard field goal to lead 10-0 with 13:39 left in the 2nd. Houston continued their trend of scoring on each possession with another Bullock field goal (38 yards) to extend their lead to 13-0 with 7:20 left; part of the same drive included the Texans converting on a 4th down and inches. The Steelers finally managed to get on the board with a 44-yard field goal from Shaun Suisham to trail 3-13 with 3:13 left. After forcing a 3 and out for the Texans, the Steelers struck back with a 35-yard touchdown pass from Roerhlisberger to Bryant to trail 10-13 with 1:27 left. After a Houston fumble at their 4-yard line, Pittsburgh took their first lead of the night to lead 17-13 with 1:03 remaining. The Steelers scored off of another Texans turnover after a Fitzpatrick pass was deflected to extend their lead with 0:14 left in the half. Following a series of Houston turnovers in arguably the worst-played three minutes in NFL history, Pittsburgh lead 24-13 at the half. After Suisham made two fourth quarter field goals, from 30 yards (27-16) and 40 yards (30-16), respectively, The Texans tried to rally for the remainder of the game with a Foster TD catch to make it 30-23, and almost pulled off an onside kick recovery, but Pittsburgh managed to avoid a disaster.

      "question": "PASSAGE: The Livonian War  was fought for control of Old Livonia , when the Tsardom of Russia faced a varying coalition of Denmark-Norway, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Union  of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. During the period 1558-1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat  and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland-Lithuania.

The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada, and were given the choice of:  remain and accept baptism,  reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or  be exiled. Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them. Therefore, only a decade after the fall of the Emirate of Granada, the entire Muslim population of Granada had nominally become Christian. A proclamation in 1502 extended these forced conversions to the rest of the lands of Castile, even though those outside Granada had nothing to do with the rebellion. The newly converted Muslims were known as nuevos cristianos  or moriscos . Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies. Many secretly practiced Islam, even as they publicly professed and practiced Christianity. In return, the Catholic rulers adopted increasingly intolerant and harsh policies in order to eradicate these characteristics.

The Seahawks drove the ball easily on their first possession, moving to the Ram 1-yard line. After a false start penalty, Seneca Wallace was sacked and fumbled, and the Rams returned the ball 89 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks drove down the field again, this time maintaining possession to the endzone as Darrell Jackson caught a 3-yard TD pass. The lead would change hands 6 more times in the game. With the Rams holding a 16-14 lead in the fourth quarter, Rams coach Scott Linehan chose to challenge a call, nullifying a field goal. The challenge was upheld, but the Rams still faced a fourth down play. Instead of kicking another field goal to increase the lead, Linehan chose to go for a first down. The raucous Qwest Field rose to the occasion, and Rams FB Paul Smith could not hear the play call. Rather than run a pass route he stayed in the backfield to block, and Ram QB Marc Bulger's pass to double covered TE Klopfenstein fell incomplete. Nate Burleson returned a punt 90 yards for a touchdown and a 21-16 lead. After a Rams TD with 2:37 remaining, a series of penalties against St. Louis changed momentum.

During the period 1558-1578, Russia dominated the region with early military successes at Dorpat  and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland-Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek, which he placed under the control of his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian vassal state Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576. In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland as well as Grand Duke of Lithuania and turned the tide of the war with his successes between 1578 and 1581, including the joint Swedish-Polish-Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland-Lithuania.

The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada, and were given the choice of:  remain and accept baptism,  reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or  be exiled. Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them. Therefore, only a decade after the fall of the Emirate of Granada, the entire Muslim population of Granada had nominally become Christian. A proclamation in 1502 extended these forced conversions to the rest of the lands of Castile, even though those outside Granada had nothing to do with the rebellion. The newly converted Muslims were known as nuevos cristianos  or moriscos . Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies. Many secretly practiced Islam, even as they publicly professed and practiced Christianity. In return, the Catholic rulers adopted increasingly intolerant and harsh policies in order to eradicate these characteristics. This culminated in Philip II's Pragmatica of 1 January 1567 which ordered the Moriscos to abandon their customs, clothing and language. The pragmatica triggered the Morisco revolts in 1568-1571.",

      "text_report": "Okay, I will provide a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs.\n\n**CAPABILITY REPORT**\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.90 (9/10)\n*   Error samples: 1/10\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs demonstrate the following:\n\n*   **Conciseness (Strength):** Answers are typically short and direct, as requested.\n*   **Correctness (Mostly):** The answers appear correct based on the problem descriptions (which are not provided but inferred from the error analysis).\n*   **Potential Issues:**  Without knowing the questions, it's difficult to definitively assess correctness, but the consistent appearance of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags suggests proper answer formatting. The error analysis focuses on over-inclusion of information, so the provided answers may contain extra text.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system exhibits a solid foundation in numerical reasoning, information extraction, and answer generation. Its ability to perform calculations and extract relevant data is promising. However, the key challenge lies in refining its information extraction capabilities to be more precise and avoid unnecessary verbosity. The system has a strong base but needs fine-tuning to reach optimal performance.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Numerical Reasoning:** Ability to perform basic calculations.\n*   **Information Extraction:** Capable of identifying relevant information within text passages.\n*   **Answer Conciseness (mostly):** Generally provides short, direct answers.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Over-inclusion of Information:** Includes extraneous details not directly required by the question.\n*   **Lack of Precision:** Struggles to extract *only* the necessary information, leading to verbose answers.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Precise Information Extraction**. Addressing this weakness will directly improve accuracy and reduce errors related to verbose answers.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Relevance Filtering:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** Develop a relevance scoring system that assigns a score to each extracted piece of information based on its direct relevance to the question. This could involve keyword matching, semantic similarity analysis, or dependency parsing.\n    *   **Implementation:**  After extracting potential answers, apply the relevance filter and discard any information with a score below a defined threshold.  Experiment with different scoring methods and thresholds to optimize performance.\n    *   **Testing:**  Create a focused test suite with examples specifically designed to trigger over-inclusion of information.  Use this suite to evaluate the effectiveness of the relevance filter.\n\n2.  **Refine Question Understanding with Explicit Negation Handling:**\n    *   **Enhancement:** Extend the question understanding module to specifically identify and process negative constraints (e.g., \"What X *excluding* Y?\"). This will help the system avoid including information that is explicitly irrelevant.\n    *   **Implementation:** Train a model, likely as part of the question understanding module, to classify question components as either \"required information\" or \"excluded information.\" This would allow the system to extract needed facts while avoiding negative constraints.\n    *    **Testing:** Develop a set of test cases that specifically focuses on questions containing negation.\n\n3.  **Post-Processing Answer Reduction Rules:**\n    *   **Rule Examples:** Develop rules that automatically remove unnecessary introductory phrases, redundant information, or context that doesn't directly answer the question. E.g., if the answer requires just a number, remove the context of the number.\n    *   **Implementation:** Add a post-processing step to the answer generation pipeline that applies these reduction rules. Be careful to avoid removing information essential to answering the question.\n    *   **Testing:** Evaluate the impact of these rules on accuracy and conciseness using both the original test set and the focused test suite.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the provided information, the AI system is currently at a **stable** capability level. While it demonstrates core strengths, the consistent error pattern of over-inclusion suggests that improvements have plateaued. Implementing the recommended actions should lead to an **improving** trend in the next iteration.\n",

This leads to answers that, while not technically incorrect, are marked as errors because they deviate from the provided golden answer.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's tendency to extract more information from the passage than is strictly necessary to answer the question, resulting in verbose and imprecise answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Information Extraction:** Improve the information extraction module to focus on extracting only the information that directly answers the question, rather than related or adjacent information.\n2.  **Answer Pruning:** Implement a post-processing step to prune the extracted information, removing any unnecessary details that do not directly contribute to answering the question.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Refine Question Understanding:** Improve the question understanding module to better identify the specific information being requested. This could involve using techniques like dependency parsing or semantic role labeling to identify the key entities and relationships in the question.\n2.  **Implement Relevance Scoring:** Develop a relevance scoring mechanism to evaluate the relevance of each piece of extracted information to the question. Information with low relevance scores can then be discarded.\n3.  **Contextual Answer Generation:** Instead of simply extracting text spans, generate an answer that is specifically tailored to the question. This would require a deeper understanding of the question and the passage, but could result in more concise and accurate answers.\n4.  **Fine-tune Extraction Granularity:** Train the information extraction module to extract information at a finer granularity. This would allow the system to extract only the essential information, rather than larger chunks of text that may contain extraneous details.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 6:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, I will provide a comprehensive capability report based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, and sample execution outputs.\n\n**CAPABILITY REPORT**\n\n**PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:**\n\n*   Accuracy: 0.90 (9/10)\n*   Error samples: 1/10\n\n**EXECUTION ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs demonstrate the following:\n\n*   **Conciseness (Strength):** Answers are typically short and direct, as requested.\n*   **Correctness (Mostly):** The answers appear correct based on the problem descriptions (which are not provided but inferred from the error analysis).\n*   **Potential Issues:**  Without knowing the questions, it's difficult to definitively assess correctness, but the consistent appearance of `ANSWER_START` and `ANSWER_END` tags suggests proper answer formatting. The error analysis focuses on over-inclusion of information, so the provided answers may contain extra text.\n\n**CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe AI system exhibits a solid foundation in numerical reasoning, information extraction, and answer generation. Its ability to perform calculations and extract relevant data is promising. However, the key challenge lies in refining its information extraction capabilities to be more precise and avoid unnecessary verbosity. The system has a strong base but needs fine-tuning to reach optimal performance.\n\n**KEY STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Numerical Reasoning:** Ability to perform basic calculations.\n*   **Information Extraction:** Capable of identifying relevant information within text passages.\n*   **Answer Conciseness (mostly):** Generally provides short, direct answers.\n\n**KEY WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Over-inclusion of Information:** Includes extraneous details not directly required by the question.\n*   **Lack of Precision:** Struggles to extract *only* the necessary information, leading to verbose answers.\n\n**IMPROVEMENT FOCUS:**\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Precise Information Extraction**. Addressing this weakness will directly improve accuracy and reduce errors related to verbose answers.\n\n**ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1.  **Implement Relevance Filtering:**\n    *   **Mechanism:** Develop a relevance scoring system that assigns a score to each extracted piece of information based on its direct relevance to the question. This could involve keyword matching, semantic similarity analysis, or dependency parsing.\n    *   **Implementation:**  After extracting potential answers, apply the relevance filter and discard any information with a score below a defined threshold.  Experiment with different scoring methods and thresholds to optimize performance.\n    *   **Testing:**  Create a focused test suite with examples specifically designed to trigger over-inclusion of information.  Use this suite to evaluate the effectiveness of the relevance filter.\n\n2.  **Refine Question Understanding with Explicit Negation Handling:**\n    *   **Enhancement:** Extend the question understanding module to specifically identify and process negative constraints (e.g., \"What X *excluding* Y?\"). This will help the system avoid including information that is explicitly irrelevant.\n    *   **Implementation:** Train a model, likely as part of the question understanding module, to classify question components as either \"required information\" or \"excluded information.\" This would allow the system to extract needed facts while avoiding negative constraints.\n    *    **Testing:** Develop a set of test cases that specifically focuses on questions containing negation.\n\n3.  **Post-Processing Answer Reduction Rules:**\n    *   **Rule Examples:** Develop rules that automatically remove unnecessary introductory phrases, redundant information, or context that doesn't directly answer the question. E.g., if the answer requires just a number, remove the context of the number.\n    *   **Implementation:** Add a post-processing step to the answer generation pipeline that applies these reduction rules. Be careful to avoid removing information essential to answering the question.\n    *   **Testing:** Evaluate the impact of these rules on accuracy and conciseness using both the original test set and the focused test suite.\n\n**CAPABILITY TREND:**\n\nBased on the provided information, the AI system is currently at a **stable** capability level. While it demonstrates core strengths, the consistent error pattern of over-inclusion suggests that improvements have plateaued. Implementing the recommended actions should lead to an **improving** trend in the next iteration.\n"

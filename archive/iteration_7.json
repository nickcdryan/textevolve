  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using a multi-stage approach with LLMs, focusing on iterative pattern refinement. It decomposes the problem into data extraction, initial pattern identification, pattern refinement, and transformation application. Each stage involves an LLM agent with a specific role (data extraction, pattern identification, pattern refinement, and transformation application) to process and refine the grid transformation. The script uses `extract_data` to get training examples, `identify_initial_pattern` to identify the initial pattern, `refine_pattern` to refine the identified pattern, `apply_refined_transformation` to apply the refined pattern, and `call_llm` to interface with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow is: `main` calls `extract_data`, then `identify_initial_pattern`, followed by `refine_pattern`, and finally `apply_refined_transformation`, with `call_llm` being used by each of these functions to query the LLM.",

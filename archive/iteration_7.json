  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with the LLM to schedule meetings, extracting constraints, verifying them, finding available times, and verifying the proposed solution. The problem is decomposed into constraint extraction, verification, solution finding, and solution verification. There are multiple agents involved, including a constraint extractor, a constraint verifier, a time finder, and a solution verifier.\n\nThe functions used are `extract_constraints_with_examples`, `verify_extracted_constraints`, `find_available_times_with_examples`, `verify_solution_with_examples`, and `call_llm`. The workflow begins with extracting constraints from the input question, verifying the extracted constraints for correctness, finding an available meeting time based on these constraints, and verifying if the proposed solution satisfies all constraints before returning the final proposed meeting time. The `call_llm` function is used by all other functions to interact with the LLM.",

This leads to incorrect availability calculations and flawed solution generation.\n2.  **Constraint Adherence:** While the system tries to follow a logical process, it fails at earliest availability.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of Time Ranges:** The system seems to have trouble correctly interpreting the starting and ending times of busy slots, often including times that should be excluded or excluding times that should be included.\n*   **Neglecting Explicit Constraints:** The system sometimes ignores specific constraints, such as preferences for earliest availability.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inaccurate parsing of conflict times**, leading to incorrect determination of participant availability. This manifests as both including unavailable times and excluding available times in the final solution, demonstrating a fundamental flaw in the information extraction process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **information_extraction:** Significantly improve the accuracy of extracting busy time slots for each participant. This includes handling edge cases and correctly interpreting time ranges.\n*   **constraint_handling:** Ensure the system prioritizes the earliest availability from all applicable days.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **LLM-Driven Conflict Parsing:** Replace the rule-based parsing of conflicts with LLM calls using chain-of-thought reasoning:\n    *   Instead of using brittle regex patterns, use an LLM call to extract each person's busy times and then VERIFY that it is correct\n    *   Instruct the LLM to first identify *all* time intervals and then check each time interval individually for whether it overlaps.\n    *   Example Prompt:\n        ```\n        For each participant, carefully identify each of their blocked time slots on each day:\n        Participant: Charles\n        Day: Monday\n        Blocked Time Slots:\n        1. From 11:00 to 12:30\n        2. From 16:30 to 17:00\n\n        Now, verify your answer carefully. Do these time slots accurately reflect Charles' schedule on Monday?\n        ```\n    *   This explicitly focuses the LLM's reasoning on identifying complete and accurate time blocks, avoiding misinterpretations.\n2.  **Verification Agent:** Create an LLM-based verification agent to validate the parsed conflict times *before* proceeding to solution generation. The verification agent should:\n    *   Receive the original problem and the extracted conflict times.\n    *   Use an LLM call to independently determine each person's availability and find the earliest time slot\n    *   Compare the extracted information with its own conclusions\n    *   Report any discrepancies and their severity.\n    *   Only proceed with solution generation if the extracted information is verified to be accurate.\n3.  **Earliest Availability Check:** Implement a final check step after generating candidate solutions to ensure the chosen time slot is indeed the earliest available option.

This leads to incorrect availability calculations and flawed solution generation.\n2.  **Constraint Adherence:** While the system tries to follow a logical process, it fails at earliest availability.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of Time Ranges:** The system seems to have trouble correctly interpreting the starting and ending times of busy slots, often including times that should be excluded or excluding times that should be included.\n*   **Neglecting Explicit Constraints:** The system sometimes ignores specific constraints, such as preferences for earliest availability.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the **inaccurate parsing of conflict times**, leading to incorrect determination of participant availability. This manifests as both including unavailable times and excluding available times in the final solution, demonstrating a fundamental flaw in the information extraction process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **information_extraction:** Significantly improve the accuracy of extracting busy time slots for each participant. This includes handling edge cases and correctly interpreting time ranges.\n*   **constraint_handling:** Ensure the system prioritizes the earliest availability from all applicable days.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **LLM-Driven Conflict Parsing:** Replace the rule-based parsing of conflicts with LLM calls using chain-of-thought reasoning:\n    *   Instead of using brittle regex patterns, use an LLM call to extract each person's busy times and then VERIFY that it is correct\n    *   Instruct the LLM to first identify *all* time intervals and then check each time interval individually for whether it overlaps.\n    *   Example Prompt:\n        ```\n        For each participant, carefully identify each of their blocked time slots on each day:\n        Participant: Charles\n        Day: Monday\n        Blocked Time Slots:\n        1. From 11:00 to 12:30\n        2. From 16:30 to 17:00\n\n        Now, verify your answer carefully. Do these time slots accurately reflect Charles' schedule on Monday?\n        ```\n    *   This explicitly focuses the LLM's reasoning on identifying complete and accurate time blocks, avoiding misinterpretations.\n2.  **Verification Agent:** Create an LLM-based verification agent to validate the parsed conflict times *before* proceeding to solution generation. The verification agent should:\n    *   Receive the original problem and the extracted conflict times.\n    *   Use an LLM call to independently determine each person's availability and find the earliest time slot\n    *   Compare the extracted information with its own conclusions\n    *   Report any discrepancies and their severity.\n    *   Only proceed with solution generation if the extracted information is verified to be accurate.\n3.  **Earliest Availability Check:** Implement a final check step after generating candidate solutions to ensure the chosen time slot is indeed the earliest available option.

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach to answer questions, incorporating question analysis and answer verification. It decomposes the problem into question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification, leveraging the LLM at each stage. No explicit agent roles are defined, but each function acts as a step in a chain. The functions `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer` sequentially process the question, each using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model. The `main` function orchestrates the overall workflow by calling these functions in sequence and handling potential errors.",

Portuguese sailors were at the vanguard of European overseas exploration, discovering and mapping the coasts of Africa, Canada, Asia and Brazil, in what became known as the Age of Discovery. Methodical expeditions started in 1419 along West Africa's coast under the sponsorship of prince Henry the Navigator, with Bartolomeu Dias reaching the Cape of Good Hope and entering the Indian Ocean in 1488. Ten years later, in 1498, Vasco da Gama led the first fleet around Africa to India, arriving in Calicut and starting a maritime route from Portugal to India. Portuguese explorations then proceeded to southeast Asia, where they reached Japan in 1542, forty-four years after their first arrival in India. In 1500, the Portuguese nobleman Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral became the first European to discover Brazil.",

To refrain from the demolition of the Hindu temple at Guruvayur, Mysore demanded 10,000 fanams from the authorities, which was paid. At the request of Governor of Malabar, Shrinivasa Rao, Hyder Ali granted a devadaya  and the temple at Guruvayur was saved from destruction. Tippu Sultan again invaded the Zamorin of Calicut's province in 1789. Aware of the risk to the idol, it was hidden underground and the Utsava vigraha was taken to Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple by Mallisseri Namboodiri and Kakkad Othikkan. Tippu destroyed the smaller shrines and set fire to the temple, but it was saved due to timely rain. Tippu lost to the Zamorin, Travancore and the English in 1792. Although the hidden idol and the Utsava vigraha were re-installed on 17 September 1792, the daily poojas and routines were seriously disrupted.",

Sample ID 1 outputs an answer between ANSWER_START and ANSWER_END which seems to represent the index of the answer in the prompt. While sample ID 2 and 3 output a boolean with verification as a side effect.\n*   **Lack of Specificity:** The system often provides a blanket confirmation (\"Verification: Correct\" or \"True\") instead of extracting relevant information. This suggests a deficiency in information retrieval and answer generation.\n*   **Missing Explanations:** The explanation is not useful in sample ID 2, it only says verification is correct but does not output the answer.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates limited capabilities in question answering, particularly when numerical or entity-based answers are required. It exhibits a tendency to default to boolean-style responses even when inappropriate. While it can extract simple numerical answers, this ability is fragile and doesn't extend to cases requiring deeper understanding or extraction from context. The system's overall performance is weak (Accuracy: 0.40).\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Generation:** The system consistently produces an output, avoiding crashes.\n*   **Basic Numerical Extraction:**  The system can, in some cases, extract numerical answers directly provided in the prompt.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Question Interpretation:** Inability to accurately interpret the type of question being asked and determine the appropriate answer format.\n*   **Numerical Extraction:** Inability to reliably extract numerical information embedded within text.\n*   **Answer Generation:** Inability to generate the correct type of answer based on the question asked.\n*   **Lack of \"No Answer\" Mechanism:** The system lacks a mechanism to indicate when it cannot find a relevant answer, defaulting to generic positive assertions.\n*   **Explanation Generation**: Explanation generation is inconsistent, and lacks the ability to extract the answer.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Question Interpretation and Answer Type Determination**.  Improving this will have a cascading effect on the system's ability to extract relevant information and generate appropriate answers.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Question Type Classifier:** Train a model (e.g., using a transformer-based architecture) specifically to classify questions into distinct categories: *Numerical Answer*, *Entity Extraction (Name, Location, etc.)*, *Boolean*, *Explanation*, *Comparative*, etc.  The output of this classifier should strongly guide the subsequent information extraction and answer generation steps. Use a dataset of question-answer pairs with explicit labels for question type.\n2.  **Develop Specialized Extraction Modules:** Create separate modules tailored to different question types. For example, a *Numerical Extractor* would use regular expressions and contextual analysis to identify and extract numerical values with their units. An *Entity Extractor* would use named entity recognition (NER) techniques to identify and extract entities of specific types.\n3.  **Implement Answer Type Validation:** After generating an answer, compare its data type against the expected data type derived from the question type.  If there's a mismatch (e.g., the question type is \"numerical answer\" but the extracted answer is a string), trigger a re-evaluation of the extraction process or return a \"no answer\" response.\n4.  **Introduce a Confidence Scoring System:** Assign a confidence score to each extracted answer based on factors like:\n    *   Strength of evidence in the passage.\n    *   Confidence score from the NER or regex module used.\n    *   Alignment between the extracted answer type and the expected question type.\n    *   Threshold this score for an answer.\n\n    If the confidence score falls below a predefined threshold, return a \"no answer\" response.\n5. **Explanation Generation Improvements:** When outputting \"Verification: Correct\", the explanation should also include the extracted answer. This provides more context and helps in debugging.\n6.  **Standardized Output Format:** Implement a consistent JSON-based output format. This will simplify parsing and integration with other systems. Include fields for question, extracted answer, confidence score, question type and explanation.\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the capacity of the reactor?\",\n      \"answer\": \"53 MW\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"question_type\": \"numerical_answer\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The passage states the reactor has a capacity of 53 MW.\"\n    }\n    ```\n7.  **Debugging improvements:** When an error occurs or when there is a mismatch of types, provide the raw answer.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the low accuracy and the nature of the errors, the system's capabilities are currently **stable at a low level**. Without significant architectural and algorithmic changes, it's unlikely to improve substantially. The actionable recommendations above aim to shift the trend towards improvement.\n",

This provides more context and helps in debugging.\n6.  **Standardized Output Format:** Implement a consistent JSON-based output format. This will simplify parsing and integration with other systems. Include fields for question, extracted answer, confidence score, question type and explanation.\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the capacity of the reactor?\",\n      \"answer\": \"53 MW\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.85,\n      \"question_type\": \"numerical_answer\",\n      \"explanation\": \"The passage states the reactor has a capacity of 53 MW.\"\n    }\n    ```\n7.  **Debugging improvements:** When an error occurs or when there is a mismatch of types, provide the raw answer.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the low accuracy and the nature of the errors, the system's capabilities are currently **stable at a low level**. Without significant architectural and algorithmic changes, it's unlikely to improve substantially. The actionable recommendations above aim to shift the trend towards improvement.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script implements LLM-Guided Recursive Decomposition & Verification (LLM-RDRV) to answer complex questions. It decomposes the original question into sub-questions, answers each sub-question individually, verifies the answers, and synthesizes them into a final answer. This involves agent roles like question decomposer, answerer, and validator. The functions used are `call_llm`, `decompose_question`, `answer_sub_question`, `verify_answer`, `synthesize_answers`, and `main`. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `decompose_question` to break down the initial question, then iterates through the sub-questions, using `answer_sub_question` to find answers, and `verify_answer` to check the validity of each response before finally using `synthesize_answers` to give the final output.",

This indicates an issue with the execution or linkage of sub-questions.\n2.  **Synthesized Answer Issue:** The system sometimes outputs a synthesized answer that simply restates parts of the question, even when it has identified relevant information. This suggests a problem with the answer synthesis process.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Sub-question Execution and Integration:** The most critical bottleneck is the system's inability to consistently execute the sub-questions it generates and integrate the answers into a final solution.\n2.  **Answer Synthesis:** The process of synthesizing the final answer from verified information needs improvement. The system sometimes provides redundant or incomplete answers.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\nThe primary error pattern observed is the generation of appropriate sub-questions followed by a failure to answer them or utilize them effectively in deriving the final answer.

The sub-question generation is effective, but the execution and synthesis steps are flawed.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Sub-question Processing:** The system needs a more robust mechanism for processing each sub-question, retrieving the relevant information, and storing the answer in a structured manner.\n2.  **Answer Synthesis:** Improve the answer synthesis module to effectively combine the answers to individual sub-questions into a comprehensive and accurate final answer. This may involve using the sub-questions as a guide for structuring the answer.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a Sub-question Execution Module:** Create a dedicated module responsible for executing each sub-question, using information retrieval or reasoning techniques to find the answer. This module should store the answers to sub-questions in a structured format (e.g., a dictionary mapping sub-question to answer).\n2.  **Enhance Answer Synthesis Logic:** Modify the answer synthesis module to utilize the structured answers from the sub-question execution module. The module should consider the relationships between sub-questions and use these relationships to construct a coherent and complete final answer. For example, use templates or rule-based systems to structure the output based on the sub-questions. If a sub-question cannot be answered, the system should have a strategy for handling this (e.g., attempting alternative phrasing or acknowledging the missing information).\n3.  **Add Tracing and Debugging Tools:** Implement more extensive logging and tracing mechanisms. Print the intermediate results of each sub-question execution and the reasoning steps of the answer synthesis module. This will enable easier debugging and identification of failure points.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (identified the entities)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (couldn't derive a solution from sub-questions)\n    *   solution_verification: N/A (no solution to verify)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (couldn't identify the correct answer)\n",

However, it then immediately returns \"Could not find the answer.\" This indicates a critical failure in the execution or retrieval of information related to these sub-questions. The \"INVALID\" verification result reinforces the issue - the generated sub-questions are never actually utilized.\n\n**Sample 1 (Success):** The system generates sub-questions to confirm information about Leslie Gabriel Valiant's career. It successfully extracts information to answer sub-questions #1 and #2 and correctly identifies that sub-question #3 cannot be answered due to an incomplete condition. However, the synthesized answer contains an error: it claims Valiant was at Carnegie Mellon in 1973-74, which contradicts the validated information that he was at the University of Warwick that year. This reveals a flaw in the answer synthesis logic, prioritizing a source over the verified data.\n\n**Sample 2 (Success):** The system accurately generates sub-questions to verify information about Mehbooba Mufti and her daughter. It correctly verifies each sub-question and synthesizes an accurate answer. This showcases the system's ability to handle simple information verification and synthesis tasks when all sub-questions are successfully answered.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a promising ability to generate relevant sub-questions for complex questions. However, its ability to *execute* these sub-questions and synthesize the results is inconsistent and prone to errors.

Without a reliable method for answering the sub-questions, the entire system is ineffective.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Robust Sub-question Execution Module with Structured Storage:**\n    *   **Action:** Design and implement a module that specifically focuses on executing each generated sub-question. This module should leverage information retrieval techniques (e.g., knowledge base querying, web search) to find answers.\n    *   **Storage:** Store the answers to each sub-question in a structured format (e.g., a dictionary) that links the sub-question to its corresponding answer and the source from which the answer was derived.  Include a confidence score or provenance for each piece of information.\n    *   **Example:**  `{ \"What is the Mechanical Glove item in the video game Terraria?\": { \"answer\": \"The Mechanical Glove is an accessory...\", \"source\": \"Terraria Wiki\", \"confidence\": 0.95 }}`\n\n2.  **Refine Answer Synthesis Logic with Provenance Tracking:**\n    *   **Action:** Modify the answer synthesis module to explicitly use the structured answers from the sub-question execution module.\n    *   **Provenance:** Track the sources and confidence levels of the information used in the final answer.  Prioritize information with higher confidence and trusted sources.\n    *   **Error Handling:** If a sub-question cannot be answered, implement a strategy for handling this, such as explicitly stating that the information is unavailable or attempting to rephrase the sub-question.\n    *   **Example:**  If the system cannot find the patch number for the Mechanical Glove change, it should state: \"While the changes to the Mechanical Glove are known, the specific patch number in which they occurred could not be determined.\"\n\n3.  **Enhanced Tracing and Debugging Tools with Intermediate Result Logging:**\n    *   **Action:**  Implement a comprehensive logging system that captures the intermediate results of each stage: sub-question generation, sub-question execution (including the retrieved answer and its source), and answer synthesis.\n    *   **Debugging:** This will allow for easier identification of failure points and debugging of the system's behavior. Log the structured data and the confidence scores.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **stable, but with significant potential for improvement**.

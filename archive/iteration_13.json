  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM with iterative refinement and constraint validation. It decomposes the problem into rule extraction, rule application, and verification steps. The LLM acts as an expert in identifying grid transformation patterns. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates the process, calling `call_llm` for rule extraction, grid transformation, constraint verification, and rule refinement and returns the transformed grid or a default grid if it fails. The `call_llm` function sends prompts to the Gemini API. The overall workflow involves extracting a transformation rule, applying it to generate a transformed grid, verifying the constraints of the transformed grid, and refining the rule if verification fails.",

This is the \"target block\".\n\n2.  **Locate Anchor Block:**  The \"anchor block\" is defined as the rectangular block immediately to the *left* of the \"target block\". The anchor block shares the same top and bottom row indices as the target block. If no such left-adjacent block exists (i.e., the target block is at the left edge of the grid), then skip steps 3 and 4, and the output grid will be all zeros.\n\n3.  **Extract Anchor Value:** If an anchor block is found, extract the value from the *bottom-right* element of the anchor block. This value will populate the output grid.\n\n4.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** Calculate the dimensions of the output grid.\n    *   `output_height = floor(target_height / 2)` where `target_height` is the height of the \"target block\".\n    *   `output_width = floor(target_width / 2)` where `target_width` is the width of the \"target block\".\n\n5.  **Construct and Populate Output:** Create an output grid with the calculated `output_height` and `output_width`.

This is the \"target block\".\n\n2.  **Locate Anchor Block:**  The \"anchor block\" is defined as the rectangular block immediately to the *left* of the \"target block\". The anchor block shares the same top and bottom row indices as the target block. If no such left-adjacent block exists (i.e., the target block is at the left edge of the grid), then skip steps 3 and 4, and the output grid will be all zeros.\n\n3.  **Extract Anchor Value:** If an anchor block is found, extract the value from the *bottom-right* element of the anchor block. This value will populate the output grid.\n\n4.  **Determine Output Dimensions:** Calculate the dimensions of the output grid.\n    *   `output_height = floor(target_height / 2)` where `target_height` is the height of the \"target block\".\n    *   `output_width = floor(target_width / 2)` where `target_width` is the width of the \"target block\".\n\n5.  **Construct and Populate Output:** Create an output grid with the calculated `output_height` and `output_width`.

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY REPORT - AI SYSTEM\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system generates Python code that attempts to transform the grid. However, it *only* provides the code and **fails to execute the code and print the transformed grid as output**. This is a major failure in fulfilling the task requirements. The generated code itself also appears overly complex and likely incorrect given the problem's implicit constraints.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system provides a single `[[0]]` grid as output. This demonstrates incorrect transformation and likely flawed information extraction. The value of the output grid is wrong.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system attempts a complex reasoning process, breaks down the problem, and then provides a reasonable-looking transformed grid. However, the initial \"Attempt 1 failed, refining rule:\" portion suggests the system had significant difficulty arriving at a valid approach. The fact that it needs to explicitly reason aloud indicates limitations in its implicit understanding and generalization abilities. Also, the rule is still somewhat brittle and based on potentially flawed assumptions about grid structure.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system's overall capabilities are extremely limited. While it demonstrates some aptitude for code generation and information extraction, it fails catastrophically at pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, and consistently producing the correct output. The accuracy rate of 0.00 is a clear indicator of the severity of these shortcomings. It shows hints of ability to reason but has trouble applying it consistently to the grid transformation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Code Generation (Partial):** The system *can* generate Python code to manipulate the grid. This is a good foundation, but it's currently misdirected and ineffective.\n*   **Reasoning (Partial):** The system can attempt to define a sequence of steps to perform on the grid, hinting at some reasoning capability.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition/Inductive Reasoning:** The core weakness is the inability to infer the transformation rule from examples. The system struggles to identify relevant features and relationships within the input and output grids.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** The system has difficulty understanding and manipulating spatial relationships, leading to incorrect value extraction and mismatched dimensions.\n*   **Output Format Consistency:**  The system inconsistently outputs the code it generates instead of the transformed grid. Even when it does output a grid, it doesn't always have the correct dimensions.\n*   **Solution Verification:** The system fails to use the provided training data to verify the validity of the output data.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe most critical area to focus on is **Pattern Recognition/Inductive Reasoning**. The system *must* be able to learn the underlying transformation rule from the examples provided. Without this, all other capabilities are essentially useless.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Focused Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** Instead of relying solely on code generation based on loosely defined rules, integrate a specialized algorithm specifically designed for spatial pattern recognition. Consider algorithms such as:\n\n    *   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are excellent at identifying spatial patterns. Train a CNN to predict the transformed grid from the input grid, using the examples.\n    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Represent the grid as a graph and use a GNN to learn relationships between nodes (grid cells).\n    *   **Rule-Based Systems (with Learning):** Develop a rule-based system where rules are learned through machine learning techniques (e.g., decision trees, reinforcement learning). This would allow the system to explicitly learn the transformation rules.\n\n2.  **Enforce Output Formatting:** Add a strict output formatting function that *always* ensures the final output is a properly formatted grid (list of lists) of numerical values. This should be a non-negotiable step after any grid transformation is attempted.\n\n3.  **Debugging & Monitoring:** Implement extensive debugging tools including intermediate print statements *within the generated code itself*. The purpose is to expose the internal state of the grid transformation at each step.\n\n4.  **Introduce Solution Verification**: Use the provided training data to score the output. If the output grid deviates too much from the pattern of the provided training examples, adjust the transformation accordingly.\n\n5.  **Reinforcement Learning (Optional):** Consider reinforcement learning to train the system. The reward function should be based on the accuracy of the transformed grid and the consistency of the output format.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the system's capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. The 0% accuracy and consistent errors demonstrate a lack of progress. Significant changes are needed to improve the system's performance.\n",

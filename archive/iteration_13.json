  "approach_summary": "The script uses chain-of-thought reasoning with LLMs to answer questions by decomposing them into sub-questions, extracting relevant information, and synthesizing a final answer. Each step involves a dedicated LLM agent (question decomposer, information extraction expert, and answer synthesis expert) that uses examples to guide the reasoning process. Each step also uses verification to ensure that the produced output is valid. The functions `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, and `synthesize_answer` orchestrate these steps, calling `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model with specific prompts and system instructions. The overall workflow involves decomposing the initial question, extracting information related to sub-questions, and synthesizing these extractions into a complete final answer.",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Between 1911 and 1915, Haiti was politically unstable: a series of political assassinations and forced exiles resulted in six presidents holding office during this period. Various revolutionary armies carried out the coups. Each was formed by cacos, or peasant militia from the mountains of the north, or who invaded along the porous Dominican border. They were enlisted by rival political factions under the promises of money, which would be paid after a successful revolution, and the opportunity to plunder. The United States was particularly apprehensive about the roles  played by Imperial Germany in the Western hemisphere. Controlling Tortuga, it had intervened in Haiti  and other Caribbean nations at several times during the previous few decades to exert its influence as a rival power. Germany was increasingly hostile to United States domination of the region under its claimed Monroe Doctrine. In the lead-up to the World War I, the strategic importance of the island of Hispaniola, with its manpower, material wealth, and port facilities, was understood by almost all navies operating in the Caribbean, including Germany and the still-neutral United States. Germany had invested in military and intelligence gathering across Hispaniola as part of a wider network of German interest in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 1890s through the 1910s. The United States' concern over Germany's ambitions was mirrored by apprehension and rivalry between American businessmen and the small German community in Haiti, which although numbering only about 200 in 1910 wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. German nationals controlled about 80 percent of the country's international commerce. They owned and operated utilities in Cap-Ha\u00eften and Port-au-Prince, including the main wharf and a tramway in the capital, and also had built the railway serving the Plain of the Cul-de-Sac.\n\nQUESTION: what percent of Hispaniola did the germans own?",

In the first quarter, Indianapolis trailed early as Texans kicker Kris Brown got a 28-yard field goal. The Colts responded with kicker Adam Vinatieri getting a 40-yard field goal. Houston would answer with Brown making a 34-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Indy tied the game as Vinatieri got a 39-yard field goal. The Texans retook the lead as RB Ahman Green got a 1-yard TD run. Indianapolis closed out the half as Vinatieri made a 32-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Colts took the lead as QB Peyton Manning completed a 23-yard TD pass to RB Joseph Addai. Houston would reply as RB Steve Slaton got a 71-yard TD run, yet Indy regained the lead as Addai got a 7-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Texans tried to come back as Green got a 2-yard field goal, yet Indianapolis pulled away with Vinatieri nailing a 31-yard field goal. On the Texans' final drive, QB Sage Rosenfels was intercepted by safety Melvin Bullitt (who was filling in again for the injured Bob Sanders). Ironically, it was Bullitt who picked off Rosenfels on the Texans' final drive when they played the Colts in Week 5.

      "question": "PASSAGE: Sweden occupied the undefended Norwegian province of Jemtland, which was quickly reconquered by a counterattack by forces under command of the Norwegian governor of Tr\u00f8ndelag. The forces were unwilling to launch a counterattack on Swedish land. In 1564 the Swedes marched under Claude Collart and re-occupied Jemtland, as well as Herjedalen and Tr\u00f8ndelag, including the city of Trondheim. Initially facing little opposition from the locals, their subsequent ill treatment of the Tr\u00f8ndelag natives, along with tax pressure, laid the groundwork for later resistance to Swedish invasion. Also, Tr\u00f8ndelag was assisted by the governor of Bergenhus, Erik Rosenkrantz, who forced 3500 local peasants to assist him and his 50 professional soldiers. The Swedes saw Bergenhus as their next target. Although the 400 Swedish soldiers were repelled from Tr\u00f8ndelag, Sweden continued to occupy J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen. These provinces were later regained by Denmark-Norway following the peace process in 1570. Sweden also launched attacks towards Eastern Norway. In the south-east Sweden captured B\u00e5hus Fortress, but lost it in 1566. Another part of the army marched through the valley \u00d8sterdalen in 1567, captured Hamar and continued towards Oslo. They reached as far as the Skiensfjord, and torched Skien at one point. In Oslo, however, citizens torched the city before invaders could seize it. From the south-east, more Swedish forces were then sent to aid in capturing Akershus Fortress near Oslo. These forces torched Konghelle and Sarpsborg on their way.

      "original_passage": "Between 1911 and 1915, Haiti was politically unstable: a series of political assassinations and forced exiles resulted in six presidents holding office during this period. Various revolutionary armies carried out the coups. Each was formed by cacos, or peasant militia from the mountains of the north, or who invaded along the porous Dominican border. They were enlisted by rival political factions under the promises of money, which would be paid after a successful revolution, and the opportunity to plunder. The United States was particularly apprehensive about the roles  played by Imperial Germany in the Western hemisphere. Controlling Tortuga, it had intervened in Haiti  and other Caribbean nations at several times during the previous few decades to exert its influence as a rival power. Germany was increasingly hostile to United States domination of the region under its claimed Monroe Doctrine. In the lead-up to the World War I, the strategic importance of the island of Hispaniola, with its manpower, material wealth, and port facilities, was understood by almost all navies operating in the Caribbean, including Germany and the still-neutral United States. Germany had invested in military and intelligence gathering across Hispaniola as part of a wider network of German interest in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 1890s through the 1910s. The United States' concern over Germany's ambitions was mirrored by apprehension and rivalry between American businessmen and the small German community in Haiti, which although numbering only about 200 in 1910 wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. German nationals controlled about 80 percent of the country's international commerce. They owned and operated utilities in Cap-Ha\u00eften and Port-au-Prince, including the main wharf and a tramway in the capital, and also had built the railway serving the Plain of the Cul-de-Sac.",

He compares wages and the standard of living in Pittsburgh with Birmingham, England. He finds that, after taking into account the cost of living , the standard of living of unskilled workers was about the same in the two cities, while skilled workers had about twice as high a standard of living. The American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and there was a heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America.  Shergold revealed that skilled Americans did earn higher wages than the British, yet unskilled workers did not, while Americans worked longer hours, with a greater chance of injury, and had fewer social services. Nationwide from 1890 to 1914 the unionized wages in manufacturing rose from $17.63 a week to $21.37, and the average work week fell from 54.4 to 48.8 hours a week. The pay for all factory workers was $11.94 and $15.84 because unions reached only the more skilled factory workers.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Assessment\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided execution outputs reveal several points:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (Error):** The generated response correctly identifies that the passage discusses German control in Haiti but incorrectly claims it doesn't relate to Hispaniola. This highlights a failure in understanding the geographical relationship and drawing a valid inference. The output is well-formatted textually, indicating the problem lies in comprehension and reasoning.\n*   **Sample ID 1 (Error):** The output \"5. 5\" clearly shows a formatting error. The system likely extracted a \"5\" and then performed some incorrect processing (possibly concatenation) resulting in this strange output. This suggests a potential issue in the data processing pipeline after information extraction but before answer presentation. It may involve misinterpreting a period or incorrect concatenation logic.\n*   **Sample ID 7 (Incomplete Information):** The included samples do not provide sufficient information to determine if Sample ID 7 was successfully produced.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a foundational ability to extract information and perform simple arithmetic. However, its performance is hampered by significant weaknesses in contextual understanding, numerical precision, and constraint handling. The core capabilities are present, but their effective application is inconsistent, leading to a moderate overall capability level. The system has potential but needs refinement to achieve reliable performance.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:**  The ability to extract relevant information from text passages, evidenced by success in several cases where correct answers were derived.\n*   **Basic Arithmetic:**  Performing simple arithmetic operations when the required information is successfully retrieved.\n\nThese strengths form the foundation for a more capable system. Maintaining and building upon them is crucial.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Contextual Reasoning and Inference:**  A critical inability to connect related pieces of information and draw logical inferences (e.g., relating Haiti to Hispaniola).\n*   **Numerical Precision and Formatting:**  Inaccuracies in numerical calculations, rounding errors, and improper formatting of numerical answers.\n*   **Constraint Handling:**  Failure to correctly interpret and apply constraints specified in questions (e.g., filtering information by timeframe).\n\nThese weaknesses significantly limit the system's accuracy and reliability. Addressing them is paramount for improved performance.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Contextual Reasoning and Inference**, specifically the ability to understand relationships between entities and concepts described in the text. While numerical precision and constraint handling are also important, a failure in contextual understanding undermines the entire process. Without accurate understanding, precise calculations and constraint application are irrelevant.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Knowledge Graph Component:** Integrate a knowledge graph component that stores and retrieves relationships between entities (e.g., \"Haiti is located on Hispaniola\").  This graph can be pre-populated with common-sense knowledge and extended with information extracted from the training data. The system should query this graph during reasoning to identify related concepts.\n\n    *   **Implementation Details:**  Use a graph database like Neo4j or a Python library like NetworkX. Focus initially on geographical relationships and common entity types (countries, organizations, people).\n    *   **Testing:** Evaluate whether the system can correctly answer questions about related entities after this component is integrated.\n\n2.  **Enhance Training Data with Explicit Relationship Examples:**  Augment the training data with examples that explicitly demonstrate relationships between entities and concepts. For example, include questions like \"Where is Haiti located?\" and provide the answer \"Hispaniola.\" This will expose the model to more instances of these relationships.\n\n    *   **Data Generation:** Generate new training examples by manually creating questions and answers based on existing text passages, emphasizing relationships between entities.\n    *   **Data Integration:** Carefully integrate these new examples into the existing training dataset.\n\n3.  **Implement Intermediate Reasoning Step Logging for Sample ID 0:** Specifically for cases similar to Sample ID 0, implement a logging mechanism to record the intermediate steps of the reasoning process.  This will allow a detailed tracing of how the system fails to connect Haiti and Hispaniola.\n\n    *   **Logging Scope:** Capture the initial question, the extracted entities, the query to the knowledge graph, and the system's reasoning for either finding or not finding an answer.\n    *   **Analysis:** Analyze the logs to pinpoint the exact step where the reasoning fails.\n\n4.  **Review and Correct Numerical Processing Logic (For addressing the \"5. 5\" issue):** Carefully examine the code responsible for processing and formatting numerical answers.  Look for potential errors in string concatenation, type conversion, or rounding logic. Implement unit tests to ensure numerical values are handled correctly at each stage.\n    * **Start With Sample ID 1, adding logging to see each number and operation.**\n\nThese changes should be implemented incrementally and rigorously tested. Focus on addressing the root cause of the contextual understanding problem before optimizing numerical precision.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is currently **stable but with high potential for improvement**. The system shows promise with its information extraction abilities, but its weaknesses in contextual reasoning limit its overall performance. Addressing the identified weaknesses will likely lead to a significant upward trend in capabilities. A successful integration of a knowledge graph is likely to dramatically improve the situation.\n",

For example, show the extraction of the number, the calculation used, the final answer and why it was chosen.\n6.  **Add examples to training data where intermediate steps of the calculation are present.**\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, decision\\_making\n*   **Sample ID 1:** solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 7:** constraint\\_handling, information\\_extraction\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Assessment\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided execution outputs reveal several points:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0 (Error):** The generated response correctly identifies that the passage discusses German control in Haiti but incorrectly claims it doesn't relate to Hispaniola. This highlights a failure in understanding the geographical relationship and drawing a valid inference. The output is well-formatted textually, indicating the problem lies in comprehension and reasoning.\n*   **Sample ID 1 (Error):** The output \"5. 5\" clearly shows a formatting error. The system likely extracted a \"5\" and then performed some incorrect processing (possibly concatenation) resulting in this strange output. This suggests a potential issue in the data processing pipeline after information extraction but before answer presentation. It may involve misinterpreting a period or incorrect concatenation logic.\n*   **Sample ID 7 (Incomplete Information):** The included samples do not provide sufficient information to determine if Sample ID 7 was successfully produced.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a foundational ability to extract information and perform simple arithmetic. However, its performance is hampered by significant weaknesses in contextual understanding, numerical precision, and constraint handling. The core capabilities are present, but their effective application is inconsistent, leading to a moderate overall capability level. The system has potential but needs refinement to achieve reliable performance.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Information Retrieval:**  The ability to extract relevant information from text passages, evidenced by success in several cases where correct answers were derived.\n*   **Basic Arithmetic:**  Performing simple arithmetic operations when the required information is successfully retrieved.\n\nThese strengths form the foundation for a more capable system. Maintaining and building upon them is crucial.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Contextual Reasoning and Inference:**  A critical inability to connect related pieces of information and draw logical inferences (e.g., relating Haiti to Hispaniola).\n*   **Numerical Precision and Formatting:**  Inaccuracies in numerical calculations, rounding errors, and improper formatting of numerical answers.\n*   **Constraint Handling:**  Failure to correctly interpret and apply constraints specified in questions (e.g., filtering information by timeframe).\n\nThese weaknesses significantly limit the system's accuracy and reliability. Addressing them is paramount for improved performance.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Contextual Reasoning and Inference**, specifically the ability to understand relationships between entities and concepts described in the text. While numerical precision and constraint handling are also important, a failure in contextual understanding undermines the entire process. Without accurate understanding, precise calculations and constraint application are irrelevant.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Knowledge Graph Component:** Integrate a knowledge graph component that stores and retrieves relationships between entities (e.g., \"Haiti is located on Hispaniola\").  This graph can be pre-populated with common-sense knowledge and extended with information extracted from the training data. The system should query this graph during reasoning to identify related concepts.\n\n    *   **Implementation Details:**  Use a graph database like Neo4j or a Python library like NetworkX. Focus initially on geographical relationships and common entity types (countries, organizations, people).\n    *   **Testing:** Evaluate whether the system can correctly answer questions about related entities after this component is integrated.\n\n2.  **Enhance Training Data with Explicit Relationship Examples:**  Augment the training data with examples that explicitly demonstrate relationships between entities and concepts. For example, include questions like \"Where is Haiti located?\" and provide the answer \"Hispaniola.\" This will expose the model to more instances of these relationships.\n\n    *   **Data Generation:** Generate new training examples by manually creating questions and answers based on existing text passages, emphasizing relationships between entities.\n    *   **Data Integration:** Carefully integrate these new examples into the existing training dataset.\n\n3.  **Implement Intermediate Reasoning Step Logging for Sample ID 0:** Specifically for cases similar to Sample ID 0, implement a logging mechanism to record the intermediate steps of the reasoning process.  This will allow a detailed tracing of how the system fails to connect Haiti and Hispaniola.\n\n    *   **Logging Scope:** Capture the initial question, the extracted entities, the query to the knowledge graph, and the system's reasoning for either finding or not finding an answer.\n    *   **Analysis:** Analyze the logs to pinpoint the exact step where the reasoning fails.\n\n4.  **Review and Correct Numerical Processing Logic (For addressing the \"5. 5\" issue):** Carefully examine the code responsible for processing and formatting numerical answers.  Look for potential errors in string concatenation, type conversion, or rounding logic. Implement unit tests to ensure numerical values are handled correctly at each stage.\n    * **Start With Sample ID 1, adding logging to see each number and operation.**\n\nThese changes should be implemented incrementally and rigorously tested. Focus on addressing the root cause of the contextual understanding problem before optimizing numerical precision.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided data, the capability trend is currently **stable but with high potential for improvement**. The system shows promise with its information extraction abilities, but its weaknesses in contextual reasoning limit its overall performance. Addressing the identified weaknesses will likely lead to a significant upward trend in capabilities. A successful integration of a knowledge graph is likely to dramatically improve the situation.\n"

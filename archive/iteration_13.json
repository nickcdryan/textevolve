  "approach_summary": "The script addresses grid transformation by converting grids to feature vectors, transforming those vectors using an LLM, and reconstructing the grid. The problem is decomposed into preprocessing, feature transformation, and grid reconstruction.  Two agent roles are implicitly defined via system instructions passed to the `call_llm` function: an expert in feature extraction/transformation and an expert in grid reconstruction. The function `preprocess_question` extracts training examples and test input. The `analyze_and_transform_features` transforms features from training examples using the test input. The function `reconstruct_grid` uses the transformed feature vector and test input to reconstruct the grid. Overall, the workflow involves extracting data, transforming features with LLM assistance, and reconstructing the output grid, with `call_llm` serving as the LLM interaction point.",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Overall Performance:** Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3), Error samples: 3/3\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a consistent pattern of incorrect transformation application. The system attempts to produce a grid-like structure, successfully outputting in JSON format (in some cases) and identifying some numerical values, but fails to learn the correct transformation logic from the training examples.\n\n*   **Output 1:** Populates the grid with repeating rows of similar numbers. This indicates a failure to understand the specific spatial relationships within the grid and an over-reliance on simple repetition. The numbers chosen (0, 4, 3, 2, 6, 9) may relate to input but without any recognizable transformation logic.\n*   **Output 2:** Partially valid JSON, but the numbers chosen (0, 2, 1, 8, 3) appear arbitrary, and the grid shape doesn't clearly correspond to a solution.\n*   **Output 3:** Generates a grid with a dominant \"7\" and \"8\" pattern, suggesting the system is extracting these numbers but not applying them contextually. The repetition of \"7\" in particular suggests an issue with spatial awareness and selective application of transformations. This output has a raw text format output instead of JSON.\n\nThe system consistently fails to produce correct answers. The errors aren't simply random noise; they display specific, repeated patterns of incorrect transformation, indicating a systematic problem in the algorithm.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a very low level of capability in solving grid transformation problems. While it can produce grid-like outputs and extract numbers from the input, it completely fails to apply correct transformation rules or handle constraints. Its attempts at pattern recognition are rudimentary and lead to overgeneralization and inconsistent application. The system is functionally non-operational for the given task.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Structure:** The system maintains a JSON formatted grid structure (though not in the third sample), which is a necessary but insufficient condition for solving the task.\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system appears capable of extracting numerical values present in the input examples.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Extrapolation:** The AI fundamentally fails to identify and apply transformation rules from training data.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system is unable to preserve original values or grid structure when applying transformations.\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** The system lacks the ability to apply transformations based on the context of individual cells within the grid.\n*   **Output Format Consistency:** Failure to consistently output in JSON format.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Extrapolation.** Without this core capability, the system is incapable of learning and applying the required transformations.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are specifically designed to recognize spatial patterns. Train the system with a CNN architecture to identify patterns in the grid transformations. Focus on smaller convolutional filters to capture local relationships.\n2.  **Reinforce Constraint Handling:** Implement a loss function that penalizes deviations from the original grid structure. Specifically, penalize the system for changing values in locations that should remain the same according to the training examples. Consider masking the predicted output with the original input as an initial step.\n3.  **Introduce Attention Mechanisms:** Implement an attention mechanism within the CNN to allow the system to focus on specific regions of the input grid that are most relevant for the transformation.\n4.  **Improve Data Preprocessing:** Standardize the grid inputs (e.g., normalizing values). This can help the model learn more stable representations.\n5.  **Explicit Transformation Modeling:** Explore explicitly modeling the transformation process as a series of discrete steps or operations. This could involve defining rules for adding, subtracting, or replacing values based on the surrounding context.\n6.  **JSON Output Validation:** Enforce JSON output format by implementing validation steps after the transformation and before the \"ANSWER_END\" tag. If the output isn't valid JSON, retry with a higher temperature in the model.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. Without significant architectural changes and targeted training, there is no indication of improvement.\n",

    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Overall Performance:** Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3), Error samples: 3/3\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a consistent pattern of incorrect transformation application. The system attempts to produce a grid-like structure, successfully outputting in JSON format (in some cases) and identifying some numerical values, but fails to learn the correct transformation logic from the training examples.\n\n*   **Output 1:** Populates the grid with repeating rows of similar numbers. This indicates a failure to understand the specific spatial relationships within the grid and an over-reliance on simple repetition. The numbers chosen (0, 4, 3, 2, 6, 9) may relate to input but without any recognizable transformation logic.\n*   **Output 2:** Partially valid JSON, but the numbers chosen (0, 2, 1, 8, 3) appear arbitrary, and the grid shape doesn't clearly correspond to a solution.\n*   **Output 3:** Generates a grid with a dominant \"7\" and \"8\" pattern, suggesting the system is extracting these numbers but not applying them contextually. The repetition of \"7\" in particular suggests an issue with spatial awareness and selective application of transformations. This output has a raw text format output instead of JSON.\n\nThe system consistently fails to produce correct answers. The errors aren't simply random noise; they display specific, repeated patterns of incorrect transformation, indicating a systematic problem in the algorithm.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system demonstrates a very low level of capability in solving grid transformation problems. While it can produce grid-like outputs and extract numbers from the input, it completely fails to apply correct transformation rules or handle constraints. Its attempts at pattern recognition are rudimentary and lead to overgeneralization and inconsistent application. The system is functionally non-operational for the given task.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Output Structure:** The system maintains a JSON formatted grid structure (though not in the third sample), which is a necessary but insufficient condition for solving the task.\n*   **Information Extraction:** The system appears capable of extracting numerical values present in the input examples.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition and Extrapolation:** The AI fundamentally fails to identify and apply transformation rules from training data.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system is unable to preserve original values or grid structure when applying transformations.\n*   **Contextual Awareness:** The system lacks the ability to apply transformations based on the context of individual cells within the grid.\n*   **Output Format Consistency:** Failure to consistently output in JSON format.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Recognition and Extrapolation.** Without this core capability, the system is incapable of learning and applying the required transformations.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are specifically designed to recognize spatial patterns. Train the system with a CNN architecture to identify patterns in the grid transformations. Focus on smaller convolutional filters to capture local relationships.\n2.  **Reinforce Constraint Handling:** Implement a loss function that penalizes deviations from the original grid structure. Specifically, penalize the system for changing values in locations that should remain the same according to the training examples. Consider masking the predicted output with the original input as an initial step.\n3.  **Introduce Attention Mechanisms:** Implement an attention mechanism within the CNN to allow the system to focus on specific regions of the input grid that are most relevant for the transformation.\n4.  **Improve Data Preprocessing:** Standardize the grid inputs (e.g., normalizing values). This can help the model learn more stable representations.\n5.  **Explicit Transformation Modeling:** Explore explicitly modeling the transformation process as a series of discrete steps or operations. This could involve defining rules for adding, subtracting, or replacing values based on the surrounding context.\n6.  **JSON Output Validation:** Enforce JSON output format by implementing validation steps after the transformation and before the \"ANSWER_END\" tag. If the output isn't valid JSON, retry with a higher temperature in the model.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the system's capabilities are currently **stable at a very low level**. Without significant architectural changes and targeted training, there is no indication of improvement.\n"

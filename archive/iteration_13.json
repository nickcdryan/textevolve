  "approach_summary": "The script uses an LLM to schedule meetings by extracting participants and constraints, solving the scheduling problem, and verifying the proposed solution. The problem is decomposed into four main steps: participant extraction, constraint extraction, solution generation, and solution verification using specialized LLM prompts with corresponding functions. The functions `extract_participants`, `extract_constraints`, `solve_meeting_problem`, and `verify_solution` are called sequentially by the `main` function to process the input question and generate the meeting schedule, with `call_llm` as the common LLM interface for each. The overall workflow involves extracting information from the question, finding a solution, and then validating it, all driven by LLM reasoning.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment based on the provided information, focusing on specific, actionable improvements and patterns in the execution outputs:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Incorrect Schedule Interpretation:**  The system consistently misinterprets the provided schedules, leading to incorrect availability assessments.  For example, in the first output, it marks the 14:30-15:00 slot on Monday as unavailable when Margaret is free until 17:00. This suggests a flaw in how the system translates the textual schedule into a usable format.\n*   **Premature Day Switching:** The system is too quick to abandon the primary constraint (finding a solution on Monday when one exists).  This violates the prompt's intention and suggests a weakness in constraint prioritization and handling.\n*   **Inconsistent Analysis:** In the second output, it starts listing all possible time slots (9:00 - 17:00 in 30-minute intervals) which shows a better understanding of how the problem should be broken down, but the busy schedule table is largely incorrect and misses the target slot. The problem should be a simple intersection of available slots based on the provided busy times.\n*   **Over-Complicated Reasoning (Example 2):** Listing out busy times for each person and then trying to find overlapping free slots may be too complex. The best solution will likely involve identifying who has the fewest constraints and working around those. It also opens up more opportunity for error in intermediate processing.\n*   **Failure to Extract Key Information:** The second output gets the available time slot as 9:00 - 9:30, which would have been an extremely easy extraction. This makes it clear the system cannot be trusted to even find obvious and clear key information.\n*   **Redundant Calculation:** Listing both 14:30 - 15:00 AND 14:30 - 15:30 on Tuesday as possible times to meet is obviously incorrect, the latter being a redundant calculation given the 30 minute minimum window requested in the prompt. The fact that the LLM is unable to remove obvious duplicates further shows it cannot be trusted in the more complex calculations.\n*   **Unnecessary Elaboration:** The LLM may be wasting its energy on unnecessary output. Breaking down the problem is necessary, but explaining how it will approach the problem is redundant and introduces a risk of inaccuracies, which could lead to future errors. It may be better to have the LLM get directly to solving the problem, rather than trying to explain it.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a basic understanding of constraint satisfaction but struggles with accurate schedule interpretation and constraint prioritization. Its ability to generate correct solutions is severely hampered by these weaknesses. The strength of the tool lies in identifying constraints, not in applying them.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   Identification of participants and their constraints.\n*   Partial, but incomplete attempt to create a structured analysis of availability.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   Inaccurate interpretation of schedule constraints leading to flawed availability analysis.\n*   Premature abandonment of the primary constraint (finding a solution on Monday).\n*   Failure to trust LLM understanding of simple facts, and relying on it too much for mathematical tasks\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **Constraint Handling**, specifically improving the accuracy of schedule interpretation and availability assessment.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Deterministic Time Slot Checker (with max_attempts):** Replace the LLM-driven schedule analysis with a deterministic Python function that explicitly iterates through each 30-minute slot on Monday and checks if *all* participants are available.  This function should be thoroughly tested independently.\n    ```python\n    def is_time_slot_available(time_slot, schedules):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a given time slot is available for all participants.\n\n        Args:\n            time_slot (tuple): A tuple representing the start and end time of the slot (e.g., (9.0, 9.5) for 9:00-9:30).\n            schedules (dict): A dictionary where keys are participant names and values are lists of busy time intervals.\n\n        Returns:\n            bool: True if the time slot is available for all participants, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        for participant, busy_times in schedules.items():\n            for busy_start, busy_end in busy_times:\n                if time_slot[0] >= busy_start and time_slot[0] < busy_end:\n                    return False  # Time slot overlaps with busy time\n        return True  # Time slot is available for all\n    ```\n\n2.  **Refine schedule interpretation and constraint handling with multiple examples:** Modify the prompt strategy to include multiple examples (3-5) where a solution *exists* on Monday.  Include examples with edge-case scenarios (e.g., the meeting time is right at the start or end of someone's availability). Explicitly state and reiterate that a solution is known to exist. For example: \"Remember, it is critical that you find a solution on Monday, as one exists. Here are some examples of how similar problems are solved with solutions on the requested day. If you cannot find a solution within two attempts, you should request the user verify the busy times being provided.\"\n    Also add a time checking function as part of the example prompt that the LLM can call to confirm times are available.\n3.  **Implement Solution Verification (with max_attempts):** Add a post-processing step using the LLM to *validate* the time slot suggested by the deterministic checker. The prompt should be focused on VERIFYING the time slot, not on re-solving the problem. Use a clear prompt: \"Confirm that ALL participants are available from [start time] to [end time] on Monday. Provide a JSON response with 'is_valid': true/false, and 'explanation': [reasoning].\"\n    ```python\n    def verify_solution(time_slot, schedules):\n        \"\"\"\n        Verifies if the suggested time slot satisfies all constraints.\n        \"\"\"\n        verification_prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Confirm that ALL participants are available from {time_slot[0]} to {time_slot[1]} on Monday. The participant schedules are: {schedules}\n\n        Respond with a JSON object:\n        {{\n          \"is_valid\": true/false,\n          \"explanation\": \"[brief explanation of why the slot is valid or invalid]\"\n        }}\n        \"\"\"\n        response = call_llm(verification_prompt)\n        try:\n            result = json.loads(response)\n            return result[\"is_valid\"], result[\"explanation\"]\n        except:\n            return False, \"Could not parse LLM verification response.\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Reduce Redundant LLM Reasoning:** The LLM should focus on extracting information and verifying solutions, but as little as possible on the calculations, as it is clearly error prone.\n5.  **Prioritize Examples with Diverse Complexity:** Use a mix of simpler and more complex examples in the few-shot prompts to ensure the system can handle different levels of constraint interaction.\n6.  **Minimize \"Wasted\" LLM Output:** Reduce output such as \"Okay, let's analyze the constraints...\" These sections are adding unnecessary complexity to the LLM.\n7.  **Add max_attempts limits to time slot checker and solution verifier functions.**\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the error patterns, the system's constraint handling capabilities appear to be **stable but inadequate**.  Without significant changes, it's unlikely to improve. The focus on deterministic code for the core time slot checking, combined with LLM verification, should lead to improvement in the next iteration.\n",

The strength of the tool lies in identifying constraints, not in applying them.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   Identification of participants and their constraints.\n*   Partial, but incomplete attempt to create a structured analysis of availability.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   Inaccurate interpretation of schedule constraints leading to flawed availability analysis.\n*   Premature abandonment of the primary constraint (finding a solution on Monday).\n*   Failure to trust LLM understanding of simple facts, and relying on it too much for mathematical tasks\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on is **Constraint Handling**, specifically improving the accuracy of schedule interpretation and availability assessment.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Deterministic Time Slot Checker (with max_attempts):** Replace the LLM-driven schedule analysis with a deterministic Python function that explicitly iterates through each 30-minute slot on Monday and checks if *all* participants are available.  This function should be thoroughly tested independently.\n    ```python\n    def is_time_slot_available(time_slot, schedules):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a given time slot is available for all participants.\n\n        Args:\n            time_slot (tuple): A tuple representing the start and end time of the slot (e.g., (9.0, 9.5) for 9:00-9:30).\n            schedules (dict): A dictionary where keys are participant names and values are lists of busy time intervals.\n\n        Returns:\n            bool: True if the time slot is available for all participants, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        for participant, busy_times in schedules.items():\n            for busy_start, busy_end in busy_times:\n                if time_slot[0] >= busy_start and time_slot[0] < busy_end:\n                    return False  # Time slot overlaps with busy time\n        return True  # Time slot is available for all\n    ```\n\n2.  **Refine schedule interpretation and constraint handling with multiple examples:** Modify the prompt strategy to include multiple examples (3-5) where a solution *exists* on Monday.  Include examples with edge-case scenarios (e.g., the meeting time is right at the start or end of someone's availability). Explicitly state and reiterate that a solution is known to exist. For example: \"Remember, it is critical that you find a solution on Monday, as one exists. Here are some examples of how similar problems are solved with solutions on the requested day. If you cannot find a solution within two attempts, you should request the user verify the busy times being provided.\"\n    Also add a time checking function as part of the example prompt that the LLM can call to confirm times are available.\n3.  **Implement Solution Verification (with max_attempts):** Add a post-processing step using the LLM to *validate* the time slot suggested by the deterministic checker. The prompt should be focused on VERIFYING the time slot, not on re-solving the problem. Use a clear prompt: \"Confirm that ALL participants are available from [start time] to [end time] on Monday. Provide a JSON response with 'is_valid': true/false, and 'explanation': [reasoning].\"\n    ```python\n    def verify_solution(time_slot, schedules):\n        \"\"\"\n        Verifies if the suggested time slot satisfies all constraints.\n        \"\"\"\n        verification_prompt = f\"\"\"\n        Confirm that ALL participants are available from {time_slot[0]} to {time_slot[1]} on Monday. The participant schedules are: {schedules}\n\n        Respond with a JSON object:\n        {{\n          \"is_valid\": true/false,\n          \"explanation\": \"[brief explanation of why the slot is valid or invalid]\"\n        }}\n        \"\"\"\n        response = call_llm(verification_prompt)\n        try:\n            result = json.loads(response)\n            return result[\"is_valid\"], result[\"explanation\"]\n        except:\n            return False, \"Could not parse LLM verification response.\"\n    ```\n\n4.  **Reduce Redundant LLM Reasoning:** The LLM should focus on extracting information and verifying solutions, but as little as possible on the calculations, as it is clearly error prone.\n5.  **Prioritize Examples with Diverse Complexity:** Use a mix of simpler and more complex examples in the few-shot prompts to ensure the system can handle different levels of constraint interaction.\n6.  **Minimize \"Wasted\" LLM Output:** Reduce output such as \"Okay, let's analyze the constraints...\" These sections are adding unnecessary complexity to the LLM.\n7.  **Add max_attempts limits to time slot checker and solution verifier functions.**\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the error patterns, the system's constraint handling capabilities appear to be **stable but inadequate**.  Without significant changes, it's unlikely to improve. The focus on deterministic code for the core time slot checking, combined with LLM verification, should lead to improvement in the next iteration.\n"

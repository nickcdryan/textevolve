  "approach_summary": "The script uses LLMs to answer questions via question decomposition, fact extraction and ranking, direct answer synthesis, and verification. The problem is broken down into sub-questions, candidate facts are extracted for each, the facts are synthesized into an answer, and the answer is verified for accuracy. There are 4 agent roles: an expert at breaking down questions, an expert in extracting facts and their relevance, an expert at synthesizing accurate answers, and a validator of answer accuracy. The function `call_llm` is used to interface with the Gemini LLM. `main` first decomposes the initial question by calling `call_llm`, then extracts candidate facts by calling `call_llm`, synthesizes an answer by calling `call_llm`, and finally verifies the answer by calling `call_llm`.",

However, the system exhibits logical errors and failures in reasoning.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n1.  **Sub-question Generation:** The system can generate relevant sub-questions to break down the main question into smaller, more manageable parts.\n2.  **Candidate Fact Extraction & Ranking:** The system attempts to extract and rank candidate facts based on relevance to the sub-questions, demonstrating an understanding of information retrieval.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Incorrect Fact Extraction:** The system sometimes extracts incorrect or irrelevant facts, even when relevant facts might exist. This is highlighted in Sample 1 and Sample 2. In Sample 1, the extraction of facts about the Mark 45 torpedo, the bazooka, and the V-1 flying bomb is completely unrelated to fencing.\n2.  **Inability to Synthesize Correct Answer from Extracted Facts:** Even when seemingly relevant facts are extracted, the system fails to synthesize the correct answer. In Sample 2, the system retrieves the incorrect year (1995) and uses it despite the gold answer stating (1989).\n3. **Fact Hallucination:** The system confidently states incorrect facts that are not validated from any source (Sample 0 and Sample 2) suggesting hallucination in its fact retrieval mechanism.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Inaccurate Fact Retrieval and Ranking:** The system struggles to accurately retrieve and rank relevant facts, leading to incorrect information being used in the synthesis stage.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Verification and Validation:** The system lacks a strong mechanism to verify the accuracy of extracted information and validate it against known facts or reliable sources.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Reliance on Single, Potentially Incorrect Facts:** The system appears to be easily swayed by a single fact, even if that fact is incorrect.

Give higher weight to facts extracted from more trustworthy sources.\n3.  **Implement a Confidence Scoring Mechanism:** Assign confidence scores to extracted facts and synthesized answers based on the reliability of the sources and the consistency of the information. Use these confidence scores to guide decision-making and flag potentially incorrect answers.\n4. **Improve the prompt to include constraints:** Improve the constraint handling to improve the output of sub-questions.

While the system demonstrates the capability to generate sub-questions and extract candidate facts, the relevance and accuracy of those facts are consistently questionable.\n\n*   **Sample 0:** The system accurately identifies Ahmed Fakroun as the first rock star of the Middle East. However, this correctness seems coincidental, as there's no apparent validation of this fact.\n*   **Sample 1:** This sample demonstrates a critical failure in information extraction. The system retrieves completely irrelevant information about military weaponry when asked about Olympic fencing weapons. The model struggles to understand the context of Olympic fencing.\n*   **Sample 2:** The system incorrectly states that Atul Gawande earned his M.A. in PPE in 1995, while the gold answer states 1989. This further emphasizes the system's issues with fact retrieval and validation. The model seems prone to \"hallucinating\" facts.\n*   **Handling of No Answer:** In sample 1, the system is unable to provide an answer and responds \"I am unable to answer the question, as the candidate facts provided do not contain the answer.\"\n\nThe repetitive statement \"Please provide the sub-question for me to extract and rank the relevance of candidate facts\" at the end of some fact extractions suggests a potential issue in how the system handles the completion of sub-question processing. This might indicate a loop or a condition that isn't being properly terminated.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system currently demonstrates very limited capability in answering questions accurately. Its sub-question generation and candidate fact extraction are promising initial steps, but the inaccurate fact retrieval and lack of verification render these capabilities almost useless. The system's overall performance is unacceptable for any practical application requiring reliable information.

Prioritize facts from trusted sources.\n    *   Implement a more sophisticated measure of contextual similarity between the sub-question and candidate facts, potentially using techniques like semantic embeddings. This will involve analyzing the surrounding text for context clues.\n3.  **Develop a Fact Verification Module:**\n    *   Create a separate module specifically for verifying the accuracy of extracted facts.\n    *   This module should use multiple sources, if available, to cross-validate information.\n    *   Implement conflict resolution strategies to handle conflicting information from different sources.\n4.  **Refine Prompt Engineering for Constraint Handling:**\n    *   Improve the prompt to emphasize the importance of relevance and accuracy in fact extraction.\n    *   Ensure sub-questions are specific and include constraints to guide the fact retrieval process.

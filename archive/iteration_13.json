  "approach_summary": "The script addresses grid transformation problems by employing two LLM-driven agents: a Minimal Change Identifier and a Pattern Interpolator. First, `identify_minimal_change_regions` identifies stable regions in the grid. Then, `interpolate_transformation_pattern` infers the transformation logic based on these regions. The script extracts the test input, applies the transformation using `apply_transformation`, and verifies the result using `verify_transformation` to ensure the output is correct based on the question. The overall workflow involves identifying minimal changes, interpolating the transformation pattern, applying it to the input grid, and finally verifying the transformation.",

However, the \"Error: Transformation verification failed. INCORRECT.\" message indicates a logical error within the transformation verification component.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Reasoning about Transformation Rules:** The system demonstrates an ability to attempt to deduce the transformation rules from training examples, as seen in the attempt to describe the 5's as \"attractors\" in sample_id 1 and inferring a movement and transformation pattern in sample_id 2.\n2.  **Error Detection:** The system correctly identifies that its proposed transformation is incorrect and provides a justification for why it believes so. This indicates a functional solution verification mechanism, even if it sometimes fails to generate the correct initial solution.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Rule Extraction:** The system struggles to accurately extract and generalize transformation rules from the training examples. The identified rules are often incomplete or flawed, leading to incorrect transformations.\n2.  **Inconsistent Transformation Application:** Even when a rule is partially identified, the system fails to consistently apply it across the entire input grid. This suggests issues with either rule encoding or execution.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Rule Generalization:** The primary bottleneck is the system's ability to generalize transformation rules from a limited set of training examples. It needs to be more robust in identifying underlying patterns and applying them to unseen inputs.\n2.  **Consistent Rule Application:** The secondary bottleneck is the system's ability to consistently apply the generalized rules. Even if a correct rule is discovered, the application logic contains bugs that lead to incorrect outputs.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Misinterpretation of Relationships:** The system seems to misinterpret the relationships between different elements in the input grid and their corresponding transformations. This leads to the identification of incomplete or incorrect rules.\n2.  **Local vs. Global Reasoning:** The system tends to focus on local patterns (e.g., how a single '5' affects neighboring cells) without considering the global context or the overall transformation strategy.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the inaccurate and incomplete extraction of transformation rules from the training examples. The current approach is not robust enough to handle the complexity and variability of the transformations, leading to incorrect solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Rule Extraction Enhancement:** Implement more sophisticated rule extraction techniques, such as:\n    *   Explicitly searching for relationships between different parts of the grid (e.g., dependencies between rows, columns, or specific elements).\n    *   Using a more expressive rule representation language that can capture complex transformation logic.\n    *   Employing machine learning techniques to learn transformation rules from the training data.\n\n2.  **Rule Application Refinement:** Improve the rule application logic to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n    *   Implement unit tests for the rule application component to catch bugs early.\n    *   Use a more structured approach to rule execution, such as a finite state machine or a graph traversal algorithm.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce a more robust rule extraction mechanism:** Instead of relying on simple pattern matching, explore techniques like inductive logic programming or program synthesis to automatically learn transformation rules from the examples.\n2.  **Implement a structured rule execution engine:** Define a clear execution model for applying the extracted rules to the input grid. This could involve creating a dependency graph of rules and executing them in a specific order.\n3.  **Enhance the verification mechanism:** Improve the solution verification process by incorporating more sophisticated checks, such as comparing the transformed grid against a set of known properties or constraints.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**System Version:** (Assuming Initial Version - V1.0)\n**Analyst:** AI System Capability Analyst\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs highlight a consistent failure in generating correct transformations. While the system demonstrates an ability to reason *about* transformations and *detect* errors, it consistently produces incorrect outputs, leading to an accuracy of 0%.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** Output is an attempted solution but is incorrect. The system seems to be arbitrarily transforming numbers.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system attempts to deduce a complex rule involving '5' as an attractor and correctly identifies that its generated output is wrong based on its hypothesized rule. However, the rule itself is incorrect.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system again attempts to reason about the transformation (moving '8' and '7' to the top row) and identifies a dependency, but still incorrectly generates the transformation, failing verification.\n\nThe consistent \"Transformation verification failed. INCORRECT.\" message, coupled with the system's own justification for its errors, indicates that the verification mechanism is functioning but the solution generation is deeply flawed.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently possesses limited capabilities. While it exhibits some level of reasoning and error detection, its core function of generating correct transformations is non-functional. The system demonstrates potential in reasoning about transformation logic and identifying its own errors, but these are overshadowed by its fundamental inability to produce accurate results. The overall capability can be classified as **pre-alpha** or **proof-of-concept stage.**\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Error Detection:** The ability to recognize and articulate why a proposed transformation is incorrect is a significant strength. The verification mechanism is working, which is valuable for debugging and future improvement.\n2.  **Attempted Rule Inference:** The system attempts to learn and generalize transformation rules from examples, even if those rules are often wrong. This indicates a foundation for a more sophisticated learning approach.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Transformation Accuracy:** The most critical weakness is the inability to generate accurate transformations. This invalidates the entire purpose of the system.\n2.  **Rule Generalization:** The system's attempts at rule extraction and generalization are highly inaccurate and inconsistent, leading to flawed transformation logic.\n3.  **Rule Application:** Even with partially correct rules, the implementation struggles to apply them consistently and accurately to the input grid.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary focus should be on **improving the accuracy of rule extraction and generalization**. Without accurate rules, the system cannot generate correct transformations, regardless of how good the error detection or rule application mechanisms are. This requires a fundamentally more robust approach to understanding the underlying transformation logic.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Rule Extraction Module with Explicit Pattern Recognition:** Replace the current ad-hoc rule extraction process with a dedicated module that explicitly searches for patterns in the training data. This module should be able to identify relationships between different elements in the grid and their corresponding transformations. Consider techniques like:\n    *   **Convolutional Filters:** To identify local patterns.\n    *   **Graph Neural Networks:** To represent relationships between grid elements.\n    *   **Attention Mechanisms:** To focus on relevant parts of the input grid when extracting rules.\n\n2.  **Develop a Structured Rule Representation Language:** Define a formal language for representing transformation rules. This will allow the system to encode complex logic in a structured and unambiguous way. The language should support concepts like:\n    *   **Conditional Transformations:** \"If cell (x, y) is '5', then transform cell (x+1, y) to '1'.\"\n    *   **Relative Addressing:** Referencing cells based on their position relative to other cells.\n    *   **Iterative Transformations:** Applying a transformation rule multiple times until a certain condition is met.\n\n3.  **Create a Rule Application Engine:** Implement a dedicated engine for applying the extracted rules to the input grid.

    "error_analysis_text": "## RUNTIME ERRORS\n\nThere are no explicit runtime errors like `JSONDecodeError` or `TypeError` present in the provided `output` fields. However, the \"Error: Transformation verification failed. INCORRECT.\" message indicates a logical error within the transformation verification component.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Reasoning about Transformation Rules:** The system demonstrates an ability to attempt to deduce the transformation rules from training examples, as seen in the attempt to describe the 5's as \"attractors\" in sample_id 1 and inferring a movement and transformation pattern in sample_id 2.\n2.  **Error Detection:** The system correctly identifies that its proposed transformation is incorrect and provides a justification for why it believes so. This indicates a functional solution verification mechanism, even if it sometimes fails to generate the correct initial solution.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Inaccurate Rule Extraction:** The system struggles to accurately extract and generalize transformation rules from the training examples. The identified rules are often incomplete or flawed, leading to incorrect transformations.\n2.  **Inconsistent Transformation Application:** Even when a rule is partially identified, the system fails to consistently apply it across the entire input grid. This suggests issues with either rule encoding or execution.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Rule Generalization:** The primary bottleneck is the system's ability to generalize transformation rules from a limited set of training examples. It needs to be more robust in identifying underlying patterns and applying them to unseen inputs.\n2.  **Consistent Rule Application:** The secondary bottleneck is the system's ability to consistently apply the generalized rules. Even if a correct rule is discovered, the application logic contains bugs that lead to incorrect outputs.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Misinterpretation of Relationships:** The system seems to misinterpret the relationships between different elements in the input grid and their corresponding transformations. This leads to the identification of incomplete or incorrect rules.\n2.  **Local vs. Global Reasoning:** The system tends to focus on local patterns (e.g., how a single '5' affects neighboring cells) without considering the global context or the overall transformation strategy.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is the inaccurate and incomplete extraction of transformation rules from the training examples. The current approach is not robust enough to handle the complexity and variability of the transformations, leading to incorrect solutions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Rule Extraction Enhancement:** Implement more sophisticated rule extraction techniques, such as:\n    *   Explicitly searching for relationships between different parts of the grid (e.g., dependencies between rows, columns, or specific elements).\n    *   Using a more expressive rule representation language that can capture complex transformation logic.\n    *   Employing machine learning techniques to learn transformation rules from the training data.\n\n2.  **Rule Application Refinement:** Improve the rule application logic to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n    *   Implement unit tests for the rule application component to catch bugs early.\n    *   Use a more structured approach to rule execution, such as a finite state machine or a graph traversal algorithm.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Introduce a more robust rule extraction mechanism:** Instead of relying on simple pattern matching, explore techniques like inductive logic programming or program synthesis to automatically learn transformation rules from the examples.\n2.  **Implement a structured rule execution engine:** Define a clear execution model for applying the extracted rules to the input grid. This could involve creating a dependency graph of rules and executing them in a specific order.\n3.  **Enhance the verification mechanism:** Improve the solution verification process by incorporating more sophisticated checks, such as comparing the transformed grid against a set of known properties or constraints.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information_extraction, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**System Version:** (Assuming Initial Version - V1.0)\n**Analyst:** AI System Capability Analyst\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs highlight a consistent failure in generating correct transformations. While the system demonstrates an ability to reason *about* transformations and *detect* errors, it consistently produces incorrect outputs, leading to an accuracy of 0%.\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** Output is an attempted solution but is incorrect. The system seems to be arbitrarily transforming numbers.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system attempts to deduce a complex rule involving '5' as an attractor and correctly identifies that its generated output is wrong based on its hypothesized rule. However, the rule itself is incorrect.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system again attempts to reason about the transformation (moving '8' and '7' to the top row) and identifies a dependency, but still incorrectly generates the transformation, failing verification.\n\nThe consistent \"Transformation verification failed. INCORRECT.\" message, coupled with the system's own justification for its errors, indicates that the verification mechanism is functioning but the solution generation is deeply flawed.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe AI system currently possesses limited capabilities. While it exhibits some level of reasoning and error detection, its core function of generating correct transformations is non-functional. The system demonstrates potential in reasoning about transformation logic and identifying its own errors, but these are overshadowed by its fundamental inability to produce accurate results. The overall capability can be classified as **pre-alpha** or **proof-of-concept stage.**\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **Error Detection:** The ability to recognize and articulate why a proposed transformation is incorrect is a significant strength. The verification mechanism is working, which is valuable for debugging and future improvement.\n2.  **Attempted Rule Inference:** The system attempts to learn and generalize transformation rules from examples, even if those rules are often wrong. This indicates a foundation for a more sophisticated learning approach.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Transformation Accuracy:** The most critical weakness is the inability to generate accurate transformations. This invalidates the entire purpose of the system.\n2.  **Rule Generalization:** The system's attempts at rule extraction and generalization are highly inaccurate and inconsistent, leading to flawed transformation logic.\n3.  **Rule Application:** Even with partially correct rules, the implementation struggles to apply them consistently and accurately to the input grid.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe primary focus should be on **improving the accuracy of rule extraction and generalization**. Without accurate rules, the system cannot generate correct transformations, regardless of how good the error detection or rule application mechanisms are. This requires a fundamentally more robust approach to understanding the underlying transformation logic.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Rule Extraction Module with Explicit Pattern Recognition:** Replace the current ad-hoc rule extraction process with a dedicated module that explicitly searches for patterns in the training data. This module should be able to identify relationships between different elements in the grid and their corresponding transformations. Consider techniques like:\n    *   **Convolutional Filters:** To identify local patterns.\n    *   **Graph Neural Networks:** To represent relationships between grid elements.\n    *   **Attention Mechanisms:** To focus on relevant parts of the input grid when extracting rules.\n\n2.  **Develop a Structured Rule Representation Language:** Define a formal language for representing transformation rules. This will allow the system to encode complex logic in a structured and unambiguous way. The language should support concepts like:\n    *   **Conditional Transformations:** \"If cell (x, y) is '5', then transform cell (x+1, y) to '1'.\"\n    *   **Relative Addressing:** Referencing cells based on their position relative to other cells.\n    *   **Iterative Transformations:** Applying a transformation rule multiple times until a certain condition is met.\n\n3.  **Create a Rule Application Engine:** Implement a dedicated engine for applying the extracted rules to the input grid. This engine should be designed for both accuracy and efficiency. Consider using:\n    *   **Finite State Machines:** To represent the execution flow of the rules.\n    *   **Graph Traversal Algorithms:** To apply rules to related grid elements in a specific order.\n\n4.  **Introduce Unit Testing for Rule Application:** Implement a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the rule application engine to ensure that rules are applied correctly in different scenarios.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **Stable at a very low level**. The system is consistently failing, but its ability to detect errors and attempt rule inference suggests that there is potential for improvement with the right interventions. However, without significant changes to the rule extraction and application mechanisms, the system is unlikely to improve.\n"

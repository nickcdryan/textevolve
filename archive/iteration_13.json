  "approach_summary": "The script employs a multi-stage LLM approach, using chain-of-thought and verification to answer questions. The problem is decomposed into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification.  The agent roles are implicit within each function which includes question analyzer, passage extractor, answer generator, and answer verifier. The script leverages the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini LLM.\n\nThe workflow is as follows: `main` calls `analyze_question` to determine question type and keywords, then `extract_relevant_passage` to get relevant context, `generate_answer` to create an initial answer, and finally `verify_answer` to validate the response.",

Brady capitalized quickly, as two quick completions to Rex Burkhead gave the Pats the lead at 12:43 in the first quarter, a lead they would not relinquish. The Broncos answered with a field goal, and on the ensuing kickoff, Pats special teams came through again with a Dion Lewis kick return for a touchdown. The Broncos added a second field goal in the first quarter, while the Patriots responded with one of their own at the start of the second quarter. The Broncos next drive stalled out short of midfield, and Burkhead found a hole in the line to block the Riley Dixon punt, once again giving the Patriots good field position. The Patriots and Broncos traded field goals, and the Patriots closed out the first half with a Brady-to-Dwayne Allen touchdown, his first reception of the season. The Broncos only sustained touchdown drive came at the start of the second half, ending in a Brock Osweiler-to-Demaryius Thomas seven-yard pass. Two more touchdowns by the Patriots (a run by Lewis and a reception by James White) would seal the deal, with Brady taking a rest at the end of the game to give new acquisition Brian Hoyer some game-time reps.

The Lions tied it later in the first quarter on a 3-yard TD pass from Matthew Stafford to Brandon Pettigrew. A 36-yard field goal by David Akers gave the Lions a 10-7 second quarter lead.  But late in the quarter, Akers had a 34-yard field goal attempt blocked by Carlos Dunlap, which the Bengals returned all the way to the Lions 40 yard line despite fumbling during the return. That set up a 12-yard TD strike from Andy Dalton to Marvin Jones just before the first half closed, giving Cincinnati a 14-10 lead. The teams exchanged TD passes in the third quarter. First, Dalton hit Tyler Eifert for a 32-yard TD, and Stafford followed shortly after with a 27-yard TD toss to Calvin Johnson. Mike Nugent connected on a 48-yard field goal late in the third to put the Bengals up 24-17.

After the game, Stafford called Johnson's play \"one of the best catches I have ever seen.\" Late in the fourth quarter, a punt by the Bengals Kevin Huber pinned the Lions at their own 6 yard line. Detroit attempted to kill enough clock to get the game to overtime, but could only gain one first down and 17 yards.

The Broncos next drive stalled out short of midfield, and Burkhead found a hole in the line to block the Riley Dixon punt, once again giving the Patriots good field position. The Patriots and Broncos traded field goals, and the Patriots closed out the first half with a Brady-to-Dwayne Allen touchdown, his first reception of the season. The Broncos only sustained touchdown drive came at the start of the second half, ending in a Brock Osweiler-to-Demaryius Thomas seven-yard pass. Two more touchdowns by the Patriots (a run by Lewis and a reception by James White) would seal the deal, with Brady taking a rest at the end of the game to give new acquisition Brian Hoyer some game-time reps.

But late in the quarter, Akers had a 34-yard field goal attempt blocked by Carlos Dunlap, which the Bengals returned all the way to the Lions 40 yard line despite fumbling during the return.

First, Dalton hit Tyler Eifert for a 32-yard TD, and Stafford followed shortly after with a 27-yard TD toss to Calvin Johnson. Mike Nugent connected on a 48-yard field goal late in the third to put the Bengals up 24-17.

      "original_passage": "At the start of World War II, the 24th Infantry was stationed at Fort Benning as school troops for the Infantry School. They participated in the Carolina Maneuvers of October - December 1941. During World War II, the 24th Infantry fought in the South Pacific Theatre as a separate regiment. Deploying on 4 April 1942 from the San Francisco Port of Embarkation, the regiment arrived in the New Hebrides Islands on 4 May 1942. The 24th moved to Guadalcanal on 28 August 1943, and was assigned to the XIV Corps. 1st Battalion deployed to Bougainville, attached to the 37th Infantry Division, from March to May 1944 for perimeter defense duty. The regiment departed Guadalcanal on 8 December 1944, and landed on Saipan and Tinian on 19 December 1944 for Garrison Duty that included mopping up the remaining Japanese forces that had yet to surrender. The regiment was assigned to the Pacific Ocean Area Command on 15 March 1945, and then to the Central Pacific Base Command on 15 May 1945, and to the Western pacific Base Command on 22 June 1945. The regiment departed Saipan and Tinian on 9 July 1945, and arrived on the Kerama Islands off Okinawa on 29 July 1945. At the end of the war, the 24th took the surrender of forces on the island of Aka-shima, the first formal surrender of a Japanese Imperial Army garrison. The regiment remained on Okinawa through 1946.",

This is seen in the success cases.\n2.  **Basic Arithmetic (in some cases):** The system can perform simple addition/subtraction/comparison when explicitly required (e.g., \"How many more field goals were there than touchdowns?\").\n3. **Numerical comparison and percentage calculation:** In sample 8, the system was able to approximately calculate the percentage of population that weren't African American.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Failure to Perform Multi-Step Reasoning:** The system struggles with questions that require multiple steps of inference or calculation. For example, calculating total points scored (sample_id 0) or total passing touchdown yards (sample_id 4).\n2.  **Inability to Handle Contextual Misdirection:** The system is easily distracted by information irrelevant to the question. In Sample 0, the question refers to \"Suns\" but passage is about a football game - system answer states this fact but can't infer that question is simply wrong and provide the real answer.\n3.  **Inconsistent Interpretation of Question Requirements:** The system sometimes misinterprets the type of reasoning needed (e.g., identifying the larger group vs. directly stating a provided statistic).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Lack of Multi-Step Reasoning and Calculation Abilities:** The system needs to be able to break down complex questions into smaller, manageable steps and perform necessary calculations based on extracted information.\n2. **Inability to handle bad questions**: The system needs to handle questions that refer to objects not in the passage. It shouldn't just point out that information isn't available, but it should understand the question may simply be incorrect and provide a correct answer based on the passage.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Numerical Calculation Errors:** A significant number of errors involve incorrect arithmetic or multi-step calculations based on information in the passage (sample_id 0, 4, 9).\n2. **Contextual Misdirection**: In sample ID 0, the system is misdirected by the mention of \"Suns\" in a passage about a football game and stops reasoning further.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the system's inability to perform multi-step reasoning, arithmetic calculations, and handle contextual misdirection when required to answer questions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Enhance Arithmetic and Calculation Capabilities:** Implement a robust calculator function that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations based on extracted numerical data.\n2.  **Implement Multi-Step Reasoning:** Develop a method for breaking down questions into smaller, logical steps and executing them sequentially. This could involve dependency parsing or semantic role labeling.\n3.  **Improve Contextual Understanding and Error Handling**: Make the system better at detecting and handling irrelevant context in questions and passages. This might involve techniques like filtering, attention mechanisms or simply skipping bad questions.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1. **Implement a Calculation Module:** Create a dedicated module specifically designed to perform calculations. This module should be able to identify numerical values and operators within the passage and the question, and then execute the calculations.\n2. **Develop a Question Decomposition Strategy:** Implement a strategy for decomposing complex questions into simpler sub-questions. For example, \"How many total points were scored?\" could be broken down into \"What were the individual scores?\" and \"What is the sum of these scores?\". Use techniques such as dependency parsing or semantic role labeling to extract meaning from the question and passage and identify the needed operations.\n3. **Implement Input Filtering**: Pre-process the question and passage to identify potentially misleading or irrelevant context. Implement attention mechanisms or filtering rules that allow the system to focus on the most relevant information. If question refers to object not present in passage - skip the question and respond with \"no answer\" or an answer based on the real question (after automatically correcting it).\n4. **Add Intermediate Output Logging:** Add `print` statements or logging mechanisms to capture intermediate reasoning steps and extracted values.

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**AI System:** [Specify System Name/Identifier]\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n### PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\n*   Accuracy: 0.50 (5/10)\n*   Error samples: 5/10\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs highlight several critical issues.\n\n*   **Inability to Handle Contextual Errors:** In Sample ID 0, the system correctly identifies that \"Suns\" are not mentioned in the passage. However, it fails to infer that the question itself might be flawed (referring to the wrong context). Instead of simply stating the absence of \"Suns,\" it should attempt to extract related information from the passage to provide a reasonable answer or indicate that the question is likely incorrect.\n*   **Success in Simple Information Retrieval:** Sample ID 1 demonstrates that the system can successfully extract specific pieces of information (player name) directly mentioned in the passage when the question is straightforward.\n*   **Success in direct answers:** Sample ID 2 demonstrates that the system can successfully retrieve a simple number, presumably for answering a numeric question.\n\nOverall, the outputs confirm the error analysis report's observations. The system struggles with nuanced question interpretation and problem-solving requiring more than direct information retrieval.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses basic information retrieval capabilities but lacks the ability to perform multi-step reasoning, handle contextual ambiguities, or perform complex calculations. While it can extract specific data points, it fails when the question requires synthesis, inference, or an understanding of the broader context.\n\nThe system's inability to handle flawed questions (e.g., Sample ID 0) is a significant liability. It demonstrates a need for improved error handling and question interpretation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Direct Information Retrieval:** The system excels at extracting specific information that is explicitly stated in the passage.\n*   **Basic Numerical Identification:** The system can correctly identify numbers for numeric question answering.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Multi-Step Reasoning:** The system cannot break down complex questions into smaller steps.\n*   **Calculation:** The system lacks the ability to perform even simple calculations.\n*   **Contextual Misdirection:** The system is easily misled by irrelevant information in the question.\n*   **Error Handling:** The system's error handling is poor; it provides unhelpful responses when questions contain flawed information.\n*   **Inability to Handle Bad Questions**: The system needs to handle questions that refer to objects not in the passage. It shouldn't just point out that information isn't available, but it should understand the question may simply be incorrect and provide a correct answer based on the passage.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **multi-step reasoning and the ability to handle bad questions by rephrasing it, filtering it or skipping it**. Addressing this weakness will have the largest impact on overall system accuracy and robustness. The system should not simply fail because a question contains an error or is poorly phrased.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Question Rewriting**: Implement a filtering module to correct and rewrite bad questions. Use external APIs like search engines, or existing knowledge banks to rephrase the question correctly. If this module fails, skip the question entirely and don't answer it.\n2.  **Develop a Question Decomposition Module:** Integrate a module that can break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions. Use dependency parsing and semantic role labeling techniques to identify relationships between entities and actions. Log the decomposed sub-questions for debugging.\n3.  **Implement a Calculation Module with Error Handling:** Create a dedicated calculation module that can perform arithmetic operations. Include comprehensive error handling to manage cases where calculations are impossible or result in invalid values.\n4.  **Integrate Error-Handling for Contextual Mismatch:** Implement a mechanism to detect and handle contextual mismatches. The system should identify when the question refers to entities or concepts that are not present in the passage and either correct the question or skip it.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are currently **stable** at a low level. To improve, the system needs significant architectural and algorithmic enhancements to address the identified weaknesses. After implementing the recommendations, monitor the system's performance closely to assess the impact of the changes and identify any new bottlenecks.\n",

If question refers to object not present in passage - skip the question and respond with \"no answer\" or an answer based on the real question (after automatically correcting it).\n4. **Add Intermediate Output Logging:** Add `print` statements or logging mechanisms to capture intermediate reasoning steps and extracted values. This will allow for easier debugging and identification of failure points.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 5:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 6:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_verification\n*   **Sample ID 9:** information\\_extraction, solution\\_generation, solution\\_verification\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT\n\n**AI System:** [Specify System Name/Identifier]\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\n### PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\n*   Accuracy: 0.50 (5/10)\n*   Error samples: 5/10\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe provided sample execution outputs highlight several critical issues.\n\n*   **Inability to Handle Contextual Errors:** In Sample ID 0, the system correctly identifies that \"Suns\" are not mentioned in the passage. However, it fails to infer that the question itself might be flawed (referring to the wrong context). Instead of simply stating the absence of \"Suns,\" it should attempt to extract related information from the passage to provide a reasonable answer or indicate that the question is likely incorrect.\n*   **Success in Simple Information Retrieval:** Sample ID 1 demonstrates that the system can successfully extract specific pieces of information (player name) directly mentioned in the passage when the question is straightforward.\n*   **Success in direct answers:** Sample ID 2 demonstrates that the system can successfully retrieve a simple number, presumably for answering a numeric question.\n\nOverall, the outputs confirm the error analysis report's observations. The system struggles with nuanced question interpretation and problem-solving requiring more than direct information retrieval.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system possesses basic information retrieval capabilities but lacks the ability to perform multi-step reasoning, handle contextual ambiguities, or perform complex calculations. While it can extract specific data points, it fails when the question requires synthesis, inference, or an understanding of the broader context.\n\nThe system's inability to handle flawed questions (e.g., Sample ID 0) is a significant liability. It demonstrates a need for improved error handling and question interpretation.\n\n### KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Direct Information Retrieval:** The system excels at extracting specific information that is explicitly stated in the passage.\n*   **Basic Numerical Identification:** The system can correctly identify numbers for numeric question answering.\n\n### KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Multi-Step Reasoning:** The system cannot break down complex questions into smaller steps.\n*   **Calculation:** The system lacks the ability to perform even simple calculations.\n*   **Contextual Misdirection:** The system is easily misled by irrelevant information in the question.\n*   **Error Handling:** The system's error handling is poor; it provides unhelpful responses when questions contain flawed information.\n*   **Inability to Handle Bad Questions**: The system needs to handle questions that refer to objects not in the passage. It shouldn't just point out that information isn't available, but it should understand the question may simply be incorrect and provide a correct answer based on the passage.\n\n### IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **multi-step reasoning and the ability to handle bad questions by rephrasing it, filtering it or skipping it**. Addressing this weakness will have the largest impact on overall system accuracy and robustness. The system should not simply fail because a question contains an error or is poorly phrased.\n\n### ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Question Rewriting**: Implement a filtering module to correct and rewrite bad questions. Use external APIs like search engines, or existing knowledge banks to rephrase the question correctly. If this module fails, skip the question entirely and don't answer it.\n2.  **Develop a Question Decomposition Module:** Integrate a module that can break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions. Use dependency parsing and semantic role labeling techniques to identify relationships between entities and actions. Log the decomposed sub-questions for debugging.\n3.  **Implement a Calculation Module with Error Handling:** Create a dedicated calculation module that can perform arithmetic operations. Include comprehensive error handling to manage cases where calculations are impossible or result in invalid values.\n4.  **Integrate Error-Handling for Contextual Mismatch:** Implement a mechanism to detect and handle contextual mismatches. The system should identify when the question refers to entities or concepts that are not present in the passage and either correct the question or skip it.\n\n### CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capabilities are currently **stable** at a low level. To improve, the system needs significant architectural and algorithmic enhancements to address the identified weaknesses. After implementing the recommendations, monitor the system's performance closely to assess the impact of the changes and identify any new bottlenecks.\n"

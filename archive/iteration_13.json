  "approach_summary": "The script uses a multi-stage approach with the Gemini LLM to solve grid transformation problems. The problem is decomposed into data extraction, initial pattern identification, pattern refinement, and transformation application.  The agent takes on the role of an expert in each stage, using example-based prompting for guidance. The functions used are `main`, `extract_data`, `identify_initial_pattern`, `refine_pattern`, `apply_refined_transformation`, and `call_llm`. The `main` function orchestrates the workflow, calling `extract_data` to get training examples and test input, `identify_initial_pattern` to deduce the initial transformation, `refine_pattern` to refine the transformation, `apply_refined_transformation` to apply the refined pattern to the test input, and `call_llm` is used to interact with the Gemini LLM throughout the process.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability assessment of your AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your requests for a thorough analysis.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs confirm the error analysis. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Sample 1:**  The system appears to be attempting to copy numbers from some source, but it's doing so in a nonsensical way.  Rows of \"3\" and \"6\" appear seemingly without reason.  The positioning of other numbers (4, 2, 9) is also incorrect, failing to reflect any discernible pattern in the training data (which we don't see but can infer). It is also generating a grid with 10 rows/columns, which may not have been intended.\n*   **Sample 2:** Again, we see seemingly arbitrary placement of numbers.  There is a small grid of 3x9, which is an interesting choice.  It is unclear why the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 8 are chosen.\n*   **Sample 3:** This output showcases an attempt to create some kind of structure using the numbers 7, 8, and 2. The repetition of \"7\" and \"8\" shows an attempt to fill space based on the numbers in the grid, but the underlying logic is flawed, and the structure does not represent any transformation.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n*   The system consistently outputs a JSON-formatted grid, which fulfills a basic requirement.\n*   There's no evidence of runtime errors like syntax issues. The errors are all *logical* \u2013 the system is \"running\" but producing the wrong answer due to flawed algorithms.\n*   The outputs are structurally very different from each other, suggesting the system might be over-fitting to individual training examples or failing to extract consistent, generalizable rules. The grid sizes are also changing.\n*   The outputs reveal a significant lack of understanding of spatial relationships and pattern generalization. The system is not recognizing and applying the correct transformations.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates *very limited* capabilities in solving grid transformation problems. While it can identify numbers and output JSON, its core function of understanding and applying transformation rules is severely deficient. The accuracy of 0.33 (1/3) confirms this. It passes in 1 out of every three test cases.\n\n*   **Strengths:** Basic number identification, JSON formatting.\n*   **Weaknesses:** Pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, generalization, constraint handling, transformation logic.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **JSON Formatting:**  Consistently producing valid JSON is essential.  Maintain this by ensuring proper JSON serialization is part of the output pipeline.\n*   **Identification of Numbers:** The fact that it can identify the \"important\" numbers in the grid is a tiny win.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Grid Transformation Logic:** The core algorithm is flawed. This is the biggest single problem.\n*   **Poor Pattern Recognition and Generalization:** Inability to learn from training examples and apply those lessons to unseen inputs.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning Deficiency:** Failure to understand and utilize spatial relationships between grid elements.\n*   **Constraint Handling:** The system is not properly applying constraints on the numbers from the grid.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe **inaccurate grid transformation logic** is the single most important capability to improve.  Without a correct transformation algorithm, all other efforts are wasted.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThese recommendations are prioritized and designed to be implemented in a focused manner:\n\n1.  **Refactor Transformation Logic (Immediately):**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Replace the existing transformation logic with a clean, well-defined, and *testable* implementation. *Start by designing a clear and concise representation of the transformation rules*. Consider a rule-based system (e.g., \"IF cell X is adjacent to cell Y with value Z, THEN set cell W to value V\").\n    *   **Rationale:** This directly addresses the core problem. A modular, rule-based system will be easier to debug and modify.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Break down the problem into smaller, manageable functions. For example: `extract_rules_from_training_example(example)`, `apply_rule(grid, rule)`, `is_rule_applicable(grid, rule)`. Add unit tests for each of these functions.\n2.  **Implement Spatial Encoding (Concurrent with #1):**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Experiment with encoding spatial information. A simple starting point is to represent each cell's neighbors (north, south, east, west) as features.\n    *   **Rationale:** Provides the system with information about the location of each number.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** When extracting rules, include neighbor values as part of the rule conditions. For example: \"IF cell(x,y) == 5 AND cell(x-1, y) == 2, THEN...\".\n3.  **Add Error Detection and Logging (Low Overhead):**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Add `assert` statements and logging throughout the transformation logic to detect unexpected conditions or invalid states. Log the input grid, the extracted rules, and the state of the grid after each transformation step.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will provide valuable insights into *where* the system is going wrong.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Use Python's `logging` module.  For example: `logging.debug(f\"Applying rule: {rule}\")`.\n4.  **Develop Intermediate Step Visualizations (After #1 and #2):**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Create functions to visualize the state of the grid at various stages of the transformation process. This can be as simple as printing the grid to the console in a human-readable format or as sophisticated as using a library like `matplotlib` to create graphical representations.\n    *   **Rationale:** Visualizations are invaluable for debugging and understanding the system's behavior.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Create a function `visualize_grid(grid)` that takes a grid as input and prints it to the console or generates a simple image. Call this function after each major transformation step.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level**. The system consistently fails to solve the problems correctly due to the flawed transformation logic. Further improvements in pattern recognition and spatial reasoning are needed.\n\nBy focusing on these actionable recommendations, you can begin to improve the system's core capabilities and move towards a more robust and accurate solution.  Remember to prioritize and test each change incrementally.\n",

Log the input grid, the extracted rules, and the state of the grid after each transformation step.\n    *   **Rationale:** This will provide valuable insights into *where* the system is going wrong.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Use Python's `logging` module.  For example: `logging.debug(f\"Applying rule: {rule}\")`.\n4.  **Develop Intermediate Step Visualizations (After #1 and #2):**\n    *   **Recommendation:** Create functions to visualize the state of the grid at various stages of the transformation process. This can be as simple as printing the grid to the console in a human-readable format or as sophisticated as using a library like `matplotlib` to create graphical representations.\n    *   **Rationale:** Visualizations are invaluable for debugging and understanding the system's behavior.\n    *   **Implementation Details:** Create a function `visualize_grid(grid)` that takes a grid as input and prints it to the console or generates a simple image. Call this function after each major transformation step.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the provided information, the capability trend is **stable at a very low level**. The system consistently fails to solve the problems correctly due to the flawed transformation logic. Further improvements in pattern recognition and spatial reasoning are needed.\n\nBy focusing on these actionable recommendations, you can begin to improve the system's core capabilities and move towards a more robust and accurate solution.  Remember to prioritize and test each change incrementally.\n"

  "approach_summary": "This script uses a multi-agent approach with LLMs to schedule meetings by first extracting constraints, then verifying them, and finally finding an available time slot. Each of these steps leverages a specialized LLM agent with corresponding system instructions, employing chain-of-thought reasoning and examples to guide the extraction and reasoning processes. The problem is decomposed into information extraction, constraint validation, and time slot searching, with LLMs driving the reasoning in each stage.",

The system is designed with a clear overall objective (scheduling meetings) and acknowledges constraints, indicating a high-level understanding of the problem type.\n2.  The problem description explicitly recognizes that a viable solution exists within the given constraints. This reduces the complexity of the task and allows the system to focus on finding an optimal solution rather than determining its feasibility.\n3.  The system attempts to handle a variety of constraints related to participant availability, preferences, and work hours, showing a capacity to incorporate diverse scheduling requirements.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **Information Extraction Failure:** The most obvious and critical weakness is the consistent failure to extract meeting details from the input text. The system is unable to identify participants, their schedules, and other relevant constraints, leading to the \"Could not extract meeting details\" error.\n2.  **Lack of Robustness:** The system seems highly sensitive to the specific formatting or phrasing of the input text. Even slight variations in how the information is presented can trigger the extraction failure.\n3. **Absence of Verification and Error Handling**: The system reports a generic error rather than attempting to provide partial or alternative solutions, indicating a deficiency in gracefully recovering from or working around missing information.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n1.  **Dependency on Brittle Information Extraction:** The system appears to be heavily reliant on inflexible parsing techniques to extract information. This makes it vulnerable to even minor variations in the input format, leading to a complete failure to process the problem. The use of brittle regex or rule-based parsing is likely the root cause.\n2.  **Inability to Reason with Partial Information:** Even if some information is successfully extracted, the system lacks the ability to reason with incomplete data and generate a potentially viable solution based on the available information.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n1.  **Consistent Extraction Failure:** All provided error cases exhibit the same \"Could not extract meeting details\" error, suggesting a systemic issue with the information extraction component.\n2.  **Sensitivity to Input Format:** The consistent extraction failures, despite the similarity in input structure across samples, hints that the parsing logic is easily disrupted by minor variations in phrasing or formatting.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe single most critical problem is the **reliance on brittle information extraction techniques (likely regex-based or rigid rule-based parsing) instead of robust, LLM-driven information extraction.** The current system fails to extract relevant details about participants, schedules, and constraints from the problem descriptions, resulting in a total breakdown of the problem-solving process.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n1.  **Information Extraction:** This area needs the most significant overhaul. The system needs to move away from inflexible parsing and adopt an LLM-centric approach to information extraction.\n2.  **Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms:** The system needs to be able to handle cases where information is incomplete or ambiguous. Implementing mechanisms to generate partial solutions or request clarification would improve robustness.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace Regex with LLM-Driven Extraction:**\n    *   **Instead of:** Relying on regex patterns to extract entities and relationships.\n    *   **Use:** LLM calls to `extract_information(text, \"What are the names of all participants mentioned?\")` or `analyze_schedule(text, \"Extract the busy times for each participant\")`.  Employ chain-of-thought prompting to guide the LLM in identifying participants, their availability, meeting duration, and any stated preferences. For example:\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_details_with_llm(question):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            Analyze the following text and extract the following information:\n            - Participants: Who needs to attend the meeting?

Be specific about time ranges when they are busy.\n            - Preferences: Are there any preferences regarding the meeting time for any participant?\n            \n            Text: {question}\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n            return parse_llm_response(response)\n\n        def parse_llm_response(response_text):\n            # Function to parse LLM output (could use JSON format if LLM is instructed to respond in JSON)\n            # Extract structured data for participants, duration, day, time constraints, schedules, and preferences\n            pass # Implementation to transform the LLM's text into structured data\n        ```\n    *   This allows the LLM to interpret the text semantically and adapt to variations in phrasing.\n\n2.  **Implement a Verification Agent:** Create an LLM-powered agent that verifies the extracted information. This agent would:\n    *   Receive the extracted information and the original question.\n    *   Use chain-of-thought reasoning to identify any inconsistencies, missing information, or potential misinterpretations.\n    *   Provide feedback to the extraction module to refine the extracted information.\n        ```python\n        def verify_extracted_details(question, extracted_info):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are given a question and extracted information.

Determine if all stated preferences are captured.\n            6. Provide a summary of any discrepancies or missing information.\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n            return parse_verification_response(response)\n\n        def parse_verification_response(response_text):\n            # Function to parse the LLM verification output\n            # Extract information about discrepancies and missing details\n            pass\n        ```\n\n3.  **Incorporate Fallback Mechanisms:** If the initial information extraction fails, implement fallback strategies:\n    *   **Retry with a simplified prompt:** If the first attempt fails, try a simpler prompt focused on extracting only the essential information (participants, duration, day).\n    *   **Request clarification:** If the system is still unable to extract the information, prompt the user for clarification on specific details.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n",

      "text_report": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system, in its current state, possesses a basic understanding of the scheduling problem but is severely limited by its inability to reliably extract information from the input text. While it demonstrates an awareness of constraints and solution generation principles, its practical utility is effectively zero due to the pervasive information extraction failures. **Overall, the system is non-functional in its current form.**\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **High-Level Understanding of the Problem:** The system recognizes the general task of scheduling meetings and acknowledges the importance of constraints. This indicates a foundation upon which to build a more effective solution.\n2.  **Design Recognizes Solution Existence:** The assumption that a solution exists allows the system to focus on optimization rather than feasibility, which simplifies the problem once information extraction is solved.\n3.  **Consideration of Diverse Constraints (in Design):** The system's design anticipates handling various constraints, including participant availability, preferences, and work hours. While not currently implemented effectively, this shows a potential for building a comprehensive scheduling solution.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **CRITICAL: Information Extraction Failure:** The consistent inability to extract meeting details renders the entire system non-functional. This is the most critical weakness by far.\n2.  **Lack of Robustness:** The system is highly sensitive to input format, demonstrating a brittle and inflexible approach to parsing.\n3.  **Absence of Error Handling and Graceful Degradation:** The system provides a generic error message instead of attempting to provide partial solutions or requesting clarification, highlighting a deficiency in handling incomplete information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction.** Without reliable information extraction, the system cannot solve any scheduling problems. Shifting from brittle, rule-based parsing to a robust, LLM-driven extraction approach is paramount.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:** Replace the existing parsing logic with a system that uses LLM calls to extract structured information from the input text. Use chain-of-thought prompting to guide the LLM and ensure accurate and complete extraction.\n    *   **Code Example (Illustrative):**\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_details_with_llm(question):\n            \"\"\"Extracts meeting details using an LLM.\"\"\"\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            Analyze the following text and extract the following information in JSON format:\n            {{\n                \"participants\": [\"list of names\"],\n                \"duration\": \"meeting duration\",\n                \"day\": \"day of the week\",\n                \"time_constraints\": \"earliest and latest possible times\",\n                \"schedules\": {{\"participant_name\": [\"busy time ranges\"]}},\n                \"preferences\": {{\"participant_name\": \"time preferences\"}}\n            }}\n            Text: {question}\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(system=\"You are an expert information extractor.\", user=prompt)\n            try:\n              details = json.loads(response) # Parse the JSON response\n              return details\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n              print(\"Error decoding JSON from LLM response.\")\n              return None\n        ```\n\n2.  **Develop a Verification Agent:** Create an LLM-powered agent to verify the extracted information, identify inconsistencies, and request clarification if needed.\n    *   **Code Example (Illustrative):**\n        ```python\n        def verify_extracted_details(question, extracted_info):\n            \"\"\"Verifies extracted information using an LLM.\"\"\"\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are given a question and extracted information.

This allows for a focused effort on improving extraction accuracy for these key elements.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable at Zero.** The system consistently fails to solve any problems due to its inability to extract information.

Implementing mechanisms to generate partial solutions or request clarification would improve robustness.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Replace Regex with LLM-Driven Extraction:**\n    *   **Instead of:** Relying on regex patterns to extract entities and relationships.\n    *   **Use:** LLM calls to `extract_information(text, \"What are the names of all participants mentioned?\")` or `analyze_schedule(text, \"Extract the busy times for each participant\")`.  Employ chain-of-thought prompting to guide the LLM in identifying participants, their availability, meeting duration, and any stated preferences. For example:\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_details_with_llm(question):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            Analyze the following text and extract the following information:\n            - Participants: Who needs to attend the meeting? Provide a list of names.\n            - Duration: How long should the meeting be?\n            - Day: On which day should the meeting be scheduled?\n            - Time Constraints: What are the earliest and latest possible times for the meeting?\n            - Individual Schedules: What are the existing schedules for each participant? Be specific about time ranges when they are busy.\n            - Preferences: Are there any preferences regarding the meeting time for any participant?\n            \n            Text: {question}\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n            return parse_llm_response(response)\n\n        def parse_llm_response(response_text):\n            # Function to parse LLM output (could use JSON format if LLM is instructed to respond in JSON)\n            # Extract structured data for participants, duration, day, time constraints, schedules, and preferences\n            pass # Implementation to transform the LLM's text into structured data\n        ```\n    *   This allows the LLM to interpret the text semantically and adapt to variations in phrasing.\n\n2.  **Implement a Verification Agent:** Create an LLM-powered agent that verifies the extracted information. This agent would:\n    *   Receive the extracted information and the original question.\n    *   Use chain-of-thought reasoning to identify any inconsistencies, missing information, or potential misinterpretations.\n    *   Provide feedback to the extraction module to refine the extracted information.\n        ```python\n        def verify_extracted_details(question, extracted_info):\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are given a question and extracted information. Determine if the extracted information accurately and completely reflects the details in the question.\n            \n            Question: {question}\n            Extracted Information: {extracted_info}\n            \n            1. Identify if any participants are missing from the Extracted Information.\n            2. Check if the duration is accurately extracted.\n            3. Verify if the day and time constraints are correct.\n            4. Confirm that the schedules of each participant are accurately represented, ensuring no busy times are missed.\n            5. Determine if all stated preferences are captured.\n            6. Provide a summary of any discrepancies or missing information.\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(prompt)\n            return parse_verification_response(response)\n\n        def parse_verification_response(response_text):\n            # Function to parse the LLM verification output\n            # Extract information about discrepancies and missing details\n            pass\n        ```\n\n3.  **Incorporate Fallback Mechanisms:** If the initial information extraction fails, implement fallback strategies:\n    *   **Retry with a simplified prompt:** If the first attempt fails, try a simpler prompt focused on extracting only the essential information (participants, duration, day).\n    *   **Request clarification:** If the system is still unable to extract the information, prompt the user for clarification on specific details.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 1:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 2:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information\\_extraction, constraint\\_handling, solution\\_generation\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system, in its current state, possesses a basic understanding of the scheduling problem but is severely limited by its inability to reliably extract information from the input text. While it demonstrates an awareness of constraints and solution generation principles, its practical utility is effectively zero due to the pervasive information extraction failures. **Overall, the system is non-functional in its current form.**\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n1.  **High-Level Understanding of the Problem:** The system recognizes the general task of scheduling meetings and acknowledges the importance of constraints. This indicates a foundation upon which to build a more effective solution.\n2.  **Design Recognizes Solution Existence:** The assumption that a solution exists allows the system to focus on optimization rather than feasibility, which simplifies the problem once information extraction is solved.\n3.  **Consideration of Diverse Constraints (in Design):** The system's design anticipates handling various constraints, including participant availability, preferences, and work hours. While not currently implemented effectively, this shows a potential for building a comprehensive scheduling solution.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n1.  **CRITICAL: Information Extraction Failure:** The consistent inability to extract meeting details renders the entire system non-functional. This is the most critical weakness by far.\n2.  **Lack of Robustness:** The system is highly sensitive to input format, demonstrating a brittle and inflexible approach to parsing.\n3.  **Absence of Error Handling and Graceful Degradation:** The system provides a generic error message instead of attempting to provide partial solutions or requesting clarification, highlighting a deficiency in handling incomplete information.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Information Extraction.** Without reliable information extraction, the system cannot solve any scheduling problems. Shifting from brittle, rule-based parsing to a robust, LLM-driven extraction approach is paramount.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement LLM-Driven Information Extraction:** Replace the existing parsing logic with a system that uses LLM calls to extract structured information from the input text. Use chain-of-thought prompting to guide the LLM and ensure accurate and complete extraction.\n    *   **Code Example (Illustrative):**\n        ```python\n        def extract_meeting_details_with_llm(question):\n            \"\"\"Extracts meeting details using an LLM.\"\"\"\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            Analyze the following text and extract the following information in JSON format:\n            {{\n                \"participants\": [\"list of names\"],\n                \"duration\": \"meeting duration\",\n                \"day\": \"day of the week\",\n                \"time_constraints\": \"earliest and latest possible times\",\n                \"schedules\": {{\"participant_name\": [\"busy time ranges\"]}},\n                \"preferences\": {{\"participant_name\": \"time preferences\"}}\n            }}\n            Text: {question}\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(system=\"You are an expert information extractor.\", user=prompt)\n            try:\n              details = json.loads(response) # Parse the JSON response\n              return details\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n              print(\"Error decoding JSON from LLM response.\")\n              return None\n        ```\n\n2.  **Develop a Verification Agent:** Create an LLM-powered agent to verify the extracted information, identify inconsistencies, and request clarification if needed.\n    *   **Code Example (Illustrative):**\n        ```python\n        def verify_extracted_details(question, extracted_info):\n            \"\"\"Verifies extracted information using an LLM.\"\"\"\n            prompt = f\"\"\"\n            You are given a question and extracted information. Determine if the extracted information accurately and completely reflects the details in the question. Provide your response as a JSON object with a 'valid' boolean field and a 'feedback' field for any issues.\n\n            Question: {question}\n            Extracted Information: {extracted_info}\n\n            Respond in JSON format with the keys \"valid\" (true or false) and \"feedback\" (string describing any issues).\n            \"\"\"\n            response = call_llm(system=\"You are a meticulous verifier.\", user=prompt)\n            try:\n                verification = json.loads(response)\n                return verification\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                print(\"Error decoding JSON from LLM verification response.\")\n                return {\"valid\": False, \"feedback\": \"Could not parse verification response.\"}\n        ```\n\n3.  **Implement Basic Error Handling:** Add error handling to catch exceptions during information extraction and provide more informative error messages.\n\n4.  **Focus on Minimal Viable Extraction:** For the next iteration, prioritize extracting *only* the essential information (participants, duration, time constraints). This allows for a focused effort on improving extraction accuracy for these key elements.\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nCurrently, the capability trend is **Stable at Zero.** The system consistently fails to solve any problems due to its inability to extract information. The trend will only improve with the successful implementation of LLM-driven information extraction.\n"

  "approach_summary": "The script uses a chain-of-thought approach, decomposing the problem into determining question type, extracting relevant information, and generating the answer, using LLMs for each stage. Each stage uses the `call_llm` function, treating the LLM as an agent that classifies questions, extracts information, and answers questions, respectively, based on given examples in the prompts. The main function `main` orchestrates the process, calling `determine_question_type`, `extract_relevant_info`, and `generate_answer` sequentially and returning the final answer, with error handling at each stage.",

      "question": "PASSAGE:  The Indianapolis Colts began their 2011 season at Reliant Stadium against the Houston Texans.  For the first time since the 1998 season, Peyton Manning was not under the helm at quarterback and it was recently acquired Kerry Collins that would take his position.  The game started very well for the Colts, opening up with an interception by Melvin Bullitt that allowed the Colts to take control.  However, a three and out from the offense quickly gave the Texans the ball to drive down and score a field goal and take a 3-0 lead.  Collins and the Colts offense was out of sync for much of the first quarter, fumbling two snaps and giving Houston the great field position inside of the Indianapolis 40-yard line.  After the first quarter, the Texans held a commanding 17-0 lead and were firing on all cylinders.  The second quarter continued Houston's dominance, with all three teams of the Colts failing to stop or to execute against the Texans.  At halftime, the Colts trailed Houston 34-0, the largest deficit in the entire 58-year history of the franchise.  The second half saw little action with both teams taking shorter drives and in some senses, running down the clock.  The Colts scored their first and the only points scored in the second half with a Reggie Wayne touchdown from Collins in the fourth quarter.  The Colts went on to lose to the Texans 34-7, their second straight season starting 0-1.\n\nQUESTION: How many total points were scored in the game?",

      "question": "PASSAGE: Playing in their second game of the season, the Cincinnati Bengals had a lot of things go wrong. Playing Ohio state rivals Cleveland Browns, the defense looked the exact opposite as they did in week one. Browns quarterback Derek Anderson started and threw for 328 yards and five touchdowns. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game. Jamal Lewis had 215 yards rushing with one touchdown and the Browns had two receivers with over 100 yards, Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow. The Bengals offense tried their best to keep the team in the game, however, as Carson Palmer threw for 6 TD's and Chad Johnson caught for 209 yards. The game started out slowly in the first quarter but the second quarter saw a combined 35 points scored. It was close in the end, when the Bengals started a drive with under one minute left. They managed to get the ball to the 50-yard line when Carson Palmer was intercepted by Leigh Bodden on an intended pass for Chad Johnson. This game ended up being the eighth highest scoring game in NFL history, but not the highest scoring game between these two teams.

      "question": "PASSAGE: After back-to-back sub-par performances by the Patriots offense, they faced Derek Carr and the lowly Raiders in their 2014 home opener looking to have their first breakout performance of the season. After both teams punted on their opening drive, the Raiders reached the Patriots 31 and struck first blood on a 49-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. After both teams punted again, the Patriots embarked on a 15 play, 84-yard drive, converting four third-downs,  and scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski midway through the second quarter to take a 7-3 lead. The Raiders punted on their next drive, and Marquette King punted only 22 yards to midfield. With the great field position, the Patriots drove all the way to the Raiders 2, but their red zone struggles continued, and they settled for a 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski, giving them a 10-3 lead at halftime. Strong defense continued in the second half. The Raiders drove deep into Patriots territory early in the second quarter, but could only score on a 37-yard field goal by Janikowski. Following a Patriots punt, the Raiders drove from their own 14, to the Patriots 37, but a false start penalty on guard Donald Penn made it 3rd-and-15, and then Carr completed a 13-yard pass to James Jones to the Patriots 29, bringing up a 4th-and-2. The Raiders decided to settle with Janikowski's 47 yard field goal, making the score 10-9. Matthew Slater returned the ensuing kickoff 26 yards to the Patriots 41. With the good field position, the Patriots drove to the Raiders 2 again, but were once again held out of the end zone, and increased their lead to 13-9 on another 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After the Raiders went three-and-out, the Patriots marched 63 yards culminating with Gostkowski's 36-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 16-9 midway through the fourth quarter. The Raiders, though, couldn't muster up any offense against the Patriots and they went three-and-out again, but the Patriots failed to put the game away and punted. In just three plays the Raiders reached Patriots territory, but two plays later, on 3rd-and-7 at the Patriots 30-yard line, Carr threw an incomplete pass seemingly bringing up a do-or-die 4th down, but Ryan was called for pass interference moving the ball to the Patriots 6-yard line. On the very next play, Darren McFadden scored on a 6-yard touchdown run, but the score was nullified by a holding penalty on Raiders left guard Gabe Jackson. On the next play, Carr's pass attempt was tipped and intercepted by Vince Wilfork with 0:51 seconds left, which sealed the win for the Patriots. Tom Brady had his best game to date, despite being pressured relentlessly by the Oakland defensive line, including being sacked twice, completing 24 of 37 passes for 234 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. The running game struggled, with Ridley leading the team with only 54 yards on 19 carries. Julian Edelman was the leading receiver for either team, with 10 catches for 84 yards. Rob Gronkowski continued to slowly work himself into the offense catching only 3 passes for 44 yards, but also caught the only touchdown. Derek Carr had a sub-par day, going 21 of 34 for only 174 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception. Both defenses were spectacular holding the opposing offense to under 300 yards of offense (241 for the Raiders, 297 for the Patriots).

It was a result of the 1750 Treaty of Madrid, which set a line of demarcation between Spanish and Portuguese colonial territory in South America. The boundary drawn up between the two nations was the Uruguay River, with Portugal possessing the land east of the river. The seven Jesuit missions east of the Uruguay River, known as the Misiones Orientales, were to be dismantled and relocated on the Spanish western side of the river. The seven missions were called San Miguel, Santos Angeles, San Lorenzo Martir, San Nicolas, San Juan Bautista, San Luis Gonzaga, and San Francisco de Borja. These missions were some of the most populous in South America with 26,362 inhabitants, according to a Jesuit census, and many more in the surrounding areas. In 1754 the Jesuits surrendered control of the missions, but the Guarani led by Sep\u00e9 Tiaraju, refused to comply with the order to relocate. Efforts by the Spanish army in 1754 to forcefully remove the Guarani from the missions failed. On February 10, 1756, a combined force of 3,000 Spanish and Portuguese soldiers fought the Guaran\u00ed at the battle of Caiboat\u00e9.

For the first time since the 1998 season, Peyton Manning was not under the helm at quarterback and it was recently acquired Kerry Collins that would take his position.

However, a three and out from the offense quickly gave the Texans the ball to drive down and score a field goal and take a 3-0 lead.  Collins and the Colts offense was out of sync for much of the first quarter, fumbling two snaps and giving Houston the great field position inside of the Indianapolis 40-yard line.

The second quarter continued Houston's dominance, with all three teams of the Colts failing to stop or to execute against the Texans.  At halftime, the Colts trailed Houston 34-0, the largest deficit in the entire 58-year history of the franchise.  The second half saw little action with both teams taking shorter drives and in some senses, running down the clock.

Playing Ohio state rivals Cleveland Browns, the defense looked the exact opposite as they did in week one. Browns quarterback Derek Anderson started and threw for 328 yards and five touchdowns. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game. Jamal Lewis had 215 yards rushing with one touchdown and the Browns had two receivers with over 100 yards, Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow. The Bengals offense tried their best to keep the team in the game, however, as Carson Palmer threw for 6 TD's and Chad Johnson caught for 209 yards. The game started out slowly in the first quarter but the second quarter saw a combined 35 points scored. It was close in the end, when the Bengals started a drive with under one minute left. They managed to get the ball to the 50-yard line when Carson Palmer was intercepted by Leigh Bodden on an intended pass for Chad Johnson. This game ended up being the eighth highest scoring game in NFL history, but not the highest scoring game between these two teams. In 2004, the Bengals beat the Browns 58-48 for the second-most combined points. The Redskins (72) and Giants (41) combined for 113 points in 1966 for the most.

Strong defense continued in the second half. The Raiders drove deep into Patriots territory early in the second quarter, but could only score on a 37-yard field goal by Janikowski. Following a Patriots punt, the Raiders drove from their own 14, to the Patriots 37, but a false start penalty on guard Donald Penn made it 3rd-and-15, and then Carr completed a 13-yard pass to James Jones to the Patriots 29, bringing up a 4th-and-2. The Raiders decided to settle with Janikowski's 47 yard field goal, making the score 10-9. Matthew Slater returned the ensuing kickoff 26 yards to the Patriots 41. With the good field position, the Patriots drove to the Raiders 2 again, but were once again held out of the end zone, and increased their lead to 13-9 on another 20-yard field goal by Gostkowski. After the Raiders went three-and-out, the Patriots marched 63 yards culminating with Gostkowski's 36-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 16-9 midway through the fourth quarter. The Raiders, though, couldn't muster up any offense against the Patriots and they went three-and-out again, but the Patriots failed to put the game away and punted. In just three plays the Raiders reached Patriots territory, but two plays later, on 3rd-and-7 at the Patriots 30-yard line, Carr threw an incomplete pass seemingly bringing up a do-or-die 4th down, but Ryan was called for pass interference moving the ball to the Patriots 6-yard line. On the very next play, Darren McFadden scored on a 6-yard touchdown run, but the score was nullified by a holding penalty on Raiders left guard Gabe Jackson. On the next play, Carr's pass attempt was tipped and intercepted by Vince Wilfork with 0:51 seconds left, which sealed the win for the Patriots. Tom Brady had his best game to date, despite being pressured relentlessly by the Oakland defensive line, including being sacked twice, completing 24 of 37 passes for 234 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions. The running game struggled, with Ridley leading the team with only 54 yards on 19 carries. Julian Edelman was the leading receiver for either team, with 10 catches for 84 yards. Rob Gronkowski continued to slowly work himself into the offense catching only 3 passes for 44 yards, but also caught the only touchdown. Derek Carr had a sub-par day, going 21 of 34 for only 174 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception. Both defenses were spectacular holding the opposing offense to under 300 yards of offense (241 for the Raiders, 297 for the Patriots). With the win the Patriots advanced to 2-1 and Brady won his 150th career game, 3rd most by a starting quarterback in NFL history.",

It was a result of the 1750 Treaty of Madrid, which set a line of demarcation between Spanish and Portuguese colonial territory in South America. The boundary drawn up between the two nations was the Uruguay River, with Portugal possessing the land east of the river. The seven Jesuit missions east of the Uruguay River, known as the Misiones Orientales, were to be dismantled and relocated on the Spanish western side of the river. The seven missions were called San Miguel, Santos Angeles, San Lorenzo Martir, San Nicolas, San Juan Bautista, San Luis Gonzaga, and San Francisco de Borja. These missions were some of the most populous in South America with 26,362 inhabitants, according to a Jesuit census, and many more in the surrounding areas. In 1754 the Jesuits surrendered control of the missions, but the Guarani led by Sep\u00e9 Tiaraju, refused to comply with the order to relocate. Efforts by the Spanish army in 1754 to forcefully remove the Guarani from the missions failed. On February 10, 1756, a combined force of 3,000 Spanish and Portuguese soldiers fought the Guaran\u00ed at the battle of Caiboat\u00e9. It resulted in the death of 1,511 Guarani, while the Europeans suffered only 4 deaths. In the aftermath of the battle, the joint Spanish-Portuguese army occupied the seven missions. Eventually Spain and Portugal annulled the 1750 treaty in the Treaty of El Pardo , with Spain regaining control over the seven missions and its surrounding territory.",

This is evident in success cases 0, 7, and 9 where the system accurately calculates totals and percentages.\n2.  **Information Extraction (Basic):** The system can extract basic facts directly stated in the passage, such as player names and scores. Success cases 3 and 6 demonstrate this ability.\n3.  **String Matching:** The system can find and identify strings in the text to match the golden answer when the relationship between the question and answer is straightforward (sample 4)\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n1.  **Complex Information Extraction & Synthesis:** The system struggles with questions requiring the extraction and synthesis of information from multiple parts of the text, or identifying relationships between entities across the passage. This is most evident in error cases 1 and 5.\n2.  **Logical Reasoning & Comparison:** The system has difficulty applying logical reasoning, especially involving comparisons and ordering. Error case 8 highlights the system's inability to properly identify the longest field goals for each player before calculating the difference.\n3.  **Constraint Handling and Ambiguity:** The system demonstrates an inability to correctly identify and apply constraints when the question demands a more sophisticated reading of the passage. In error case 1 the question specified \"the top two longest field goals\" but did not specify to list them from all field goals mentioned or by each player.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n1.  **Difficulty with Complex Reasoning and Synthesis:** The inability to synthesize information from different parts of the passage and apply logical reasoning hinders the system's ability to answer questions that require more than basic fact extraction.\n2.  **Lack of Robust Understanding of Question Constraints:** The system needs to be better at interpreting and applying the implied constraints within the question to limit the extracted information to only the most relevant data.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n1.  **Over-Extraction:** The system provides more information than the question asks for (e.g., listing multiple field goals when only the longest is required, or including extra countries when only one meets the criteria).\n2.  **Misinterpretation of Comparative Questions:** Comparative questions involving superlatives (e.g., \"longest,\" \"most\") are often mishandled.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe system's primary issue is its limited ability to extract information relevant to the implicit and explicit constraints within a question. It either extracts too much irrelevant information or fails to perform the necessary comparisons/reasoning to filter the extracted information appropriately.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n1.  **Question Understanding:** Improve the system's ability to parse and understand the question's intent, including identifying key constraints and required relationships.\n2.  **Reasoning and Synthesis:** Enhance the system's reasoning capabilities to enable it to compare and synthesize information from different parts of the passage and from external knowledge (e.g. to understand the relative magnitude of different values).\n3.  **Answer Generation:** Improve the system's ability to generate concise and accurate answers that directly address the question and adhere to all specified constraints.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Implement a \"Question Focus\" module:** Before information extraction, have a module that explicitly identifies keywords, constraints, and expected answer format from the question. This could involve techniques like dependency parsing or semantic role labeling.\n2.  **Develop a \"Contextual Filtering\" Mechanism:** After information extraction, implement a filtering mechanism that uses the \"Question Focus\" output to filter the extracted information, removing irrelevant data points. This can be implemented via a scoring mechanism based on relevance to the question.\n3.  **Integrate Comparative Reasoning Module:** Create a module that specifically handles comparative questions. This module should: a) Identify the entities being compared, b) Extract the relevant attributes for comparison, c) Perform the comparison, and d) Generate the answer based on the comparison result.\n4. Add print statements such that intermediate outputs for each module can be viewed to determine exactly where things go wrong\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample 1:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation\n*   **Sample 5:** information_extraction, solution_generation\n*   **Sample 8:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n",

For example, use the syntax to identify the entity and attribute of comparison in comparative questions.\n    *   Assign a weight to each identified constraint based on its importance to the question.\n2.  **Develop a \"Constraint-Based Filtering\" Mechanism:**\n    *   After information extraction, implement a filtering mechanism that explicitly checks whether extracted information satisfies the identified constraints.\n    *   Create a scoring system where data points that violate constraints receive negative scores, and only data points with positive scores are considered for the final answer.\n    *   Implement a threshold for the overall score, ensuring that the system only provides an answer if a sufficient number of constraints are met.\n3.  **Refine Answer Generation with Post-Processing Rules:**\n    *   Implement a post-processing step to remove extraneous text such as \"ANSWER\\_START\" and \"ANSWER\\_END.\"\n    *   Develop rules for formatting the answer based on the question type. For example, questions asking for a list should be formatted as a comma-separated list.\n4.

  "approach_summary": "The script schedules meetings using an LLM-driven system with specialized agents for extraction and scheduling. `extract_meeting_info` uses few-shot learning and a verification loop to extract meeting details, retrying if validation fails, and `schedule_meeting` uses the extracted information to propose a meeting time. The `call_llm` function interfaces with the Gemini API to handle the LLM requests. The `main` function orchestrates the process by first calling the `extract_meeting_info` function to extract all of the meeting details and then calls the `schedule_meeting` function to generate a meeting schedule; both functions return the result to the caller (`main`).",

It lists the availability of each participant.\n*   **Constraint Awareness:** The system seems to be aware of the constraints related to work hours and participant preferences, as it attempts to incorporate them in its analysis (e.g., acknowledging Emma's preference not to meet on Monday).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Assessment:** The system makes mistakes in determining the accurate availability of participants based on their schedules. This leads to proposing time slots that are not actually feasible.\n*   **Suboptimal Solution Selection:** Even when potential valid time slots are identified, the system sometimes selects a suboptimal choice or misses the correct solution altogether.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Flawed Constraint Handling:** The core bottleneck is the system's flawed ability to accurately identify and apply constraints from the schedules to determine participant availability. This undermines the entire solution generation process.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of Busy Schedules:** The system appears to have difficulty translating the provided busy schedules into accurate availability assessments, often overlooking or misinterpreting busy slots.\n*   **Inconsistent Constraint Application:** Even when the system identifies a potential time slot, it doesn't always consistently apply the constraints to verify its validity, leading to incorrect solution proposals.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **INACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF PARTICIPANT AVAILABILITY based on provided busy schedules**. This stems from errors in the system's ability to correctly interpret and apply the constraints defined by the busy schedules of each participant. The system misses busy times and incorrectly calculates available slots.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **information_extraction:** While the system extracts the busy schedules, it doesn't process them accurately. This needs improvement.\n*   **constraint_handling:** Significant improvement is needed to accurately apply constraints defined by busy schedules when determining participant availability.\n*   **solution_verification:** Better verification of proposed solutions against all constraints is crucial to avoid suggesting invalid time slots.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Develop a more robust algorithm for availability calculation:** Implement a function specifically designed to process the schedule strings, convert them into a consistent data structure (e.g., a list of time intervals), and accurately determine available time slots for each participant. Pay close attention to parsing the time ranges correctly.\n2.  **Implement a stricter solution verification process:** Before proposing a solution, implement a rigorous verification step that checks the proposed time slot against *all* participants' schedules. This can involve iterating through each participant and explicitly confirming their availability during the suggested time.\n3.  **Refine the prompting strategy:** Add few-shot examples to the prompt specifically demonstrating the correct method of parsing busy schedules and determining available time slots. Emphasize the importance of accurately accounting for all constraints.\n4. **Add unit tests for schedule parsing and availability calculation:** Create a set of unit tests that specifically target the schedule parsing and availability calculation logic. These tests should cover various edge cases and ensure the algorithm functions correctly.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your instructions:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Incorrect Time Slot Proposals:** The system often proposes time slots that directly contradict the stated constraints (e.g., proposing a time when Joan is explicitly marked as busy). This confirms the \"Inaccurate Availability Assessment\" weakness.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Constraints:** The reasoning chains show a flawed understanding of how to integrate busy schedules. For example, in one case, the system acknowledges Doris's unavailability before 15:00 but still tries to find slots before that time.\n*   **Logical Fallacies:** The system exhibits logical fallacies in its reasoning. For example, it states, \"After 16:30, everyone is free,\" even though Jean is mentioned as being busy from 16:00 - 16:30.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Logic:** Even within the same reasoning chain, the system contradicts itself regarding participant availability, highlighting an inconsistency in applying the logic.\n*   **Hallucination of Availability:** The system sometimes claims someone is free when the schedule clearly indicates they are busy. This indicates a possible over-reliance on assumed availability rather than directly evaluating the schedule strings.\n*   **Reasoning \"noise\":** One of the sample outputs demonstrates excessive \"reasoning\" leading to incorrect conclusion that no solution is possible, then reversing itself and proposing a solution.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of scheduling constraints but fails to translate this understanding into accurate availability assessment and solution generation. While it attempts to reason about schedules, the reasoning is flawed, inconsistent, and often leads to incorrect conclusions. The core problem is not simply extracting the information, but *reasoning* about the extracted information correctly to determine availability.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempts at Reasoning:** The system at least tries to break down the problem and reason about the constraints. This provides a foundation for future improvements.\n*   **Constraint Awareness:** The system is aware of the core constraints (participant schedules, time windows, meeting duration).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Flawed Availability Reasoning:** The MOST CRITICAL weakness is the inaccurate and inconsistent reasoning about participant availability based on busy schedules.

This directly addresses the \"Flawed Constraint Handling\" bottleneck.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement a Dedicated Availability Reasoning Module:** Create a separate module (likely a Python function) focused solely on accurately determining participant availability. This module should:\n\n    *   **Standardize Input:** Convert schedule strings into a standardized data structure (e.g., a list of time intervals, using datetime objects if possible).\n    *   **Implement robust Interval Logic:** Use robust logic to calculate free time intervals, considering overlapping busy times and work hour constraints.\n    *   **Include unit tests:** Thoroughly test this module with various schedule scenarios and edge cases.\n    *   **Example implementation**:\n\n        ```python\n        import datetime\n\n        def calculate_availability(schedule_string, work_start=\"09:00\", work_end=\"17:00\", meeting_duration=30):\n            \"\"\"\n            Calculates available time slots based on a schedule string.\n\n            Args:\n                schedule_string: A string representing the busy schedule.\n                work_start: The start time of the workday (string, \"HH:MM\").\n                work_end: The end time of the workday (string, \"HH:MM\").\n                meeting_duration: The duration of the meeting in minutes (integer).\n\n            Returns:\n                A list of available time slots as tuples of (start_time, end_time),\n                where start_time and end_time are datetime.datetime objects.\n            \"\"\"\n\n            # Convert work hours to datetime.time objects\n            work_start_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(work_start, \"%H:%M\").time()\n            work_end_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(work_end, \"%H:%M\").time()\n\n            # Create datetime objects for today with work hours\n            today = datetime.date.today()\n            work_start_dt = datetime.datetime.combine(today, work_start_time)\n            work_end_dt = datetime.datetime.combine(today, work_end_time)\n\n            # Parse the schedule string into busy intervals\n            busy_intervals = []\n            if schedule_string:\n                for interval in schedule_string.split(\",\"):\n                    start, end = interval.split(\"-\")\n                    start_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(start.strip(), \"%H:%M\").time()\n                    end_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(end.strip(), \"%H:%M\").time()\n\n                    # Combine with today's date\n                    start_dt = datetime.datetime.combine(today, start_time)\n                    end_dt = datetime.datetime.combine(today, end_time)\n\n                    busy_intervals.append((start_dt, end_dt))\n\n            # Sort the busy intervals by start time\n            busy_intervals.sort()\n\n            # Initialize the list of available time slots\n            available_slots = []\n\n            # Start with the beginning of the workday\n            current_time = work_start_dt\n\n            # Iterate through the busy intervals to find free slots\n            for busy_start, busy_end in busy_intervals:\n                # Check if there is a gap between the current time and the start of the busy interval\n                if current_time < busy_start:\n                    # Calculate the duration of the gap in minutes\n                    gap_duration = (busy_start - current_time).total_seconds() / 60\n\n                    # If the gap is long enough for the meeting, add it to the available slots\n                    if gap_duration >= meeting_duration:\n                        available_slots.append((current_time, busy_start))\n\n                # Move the current time to the end of the busy interval\n                current_time = max(current_time, busy_end)\n\n            # Check if there is a gap between the end of the last busy interval and the end of the workday\n            if current_time < work_end_dt:\n                # Calculate the duration of the gap in minutes\n                gap_duration = (work_end_dt - current_time).total_seconds() / 60\n\n                # If the gap is long enough for the meeting, add it to the available slots\n                if gap_duration >= meeting_duration:\n                    available_slots.append((current_time, work_end_dt))\n\n            return available_slots\n        ```\n\n2.  **Integrate the Availability Reasoning Module into the Main Workflow:** Replace the current availability reasoning logic with calls to this new module. Ensure the inputs to the module are correctly formatted.\n3.  **Implement Solution Verification using the Availability Reasoning Module:** Before proposing a solution, *explicitly* verify the proposed time slot using the new availability reasoning module for *each* participant. If the verification fails for any participant, reject the slot.\n4.  **Refine Prompting with Few-Shot Examples:** Add *multiple* few-shot examples to the prompt, specifically demonstrating how to correctly parse complex schedule strings and determine accurate availability using the proposed reasoning module. Show examples with overlapping schedules and multiple busy slots.\n5. **Add Monologue Logging**: Enhance the call_llm function to track the full prompt and response, and the execution time. This will help narrow down if latencies are prompt or implementation related.\n6.  **Focus example selection**: Prioritize including few-shot examples that emphasize parsing schedule strings with multiple time slots, as the current system struggles with this scenario\n\n## CAPABILITY TREND\n\nBased on the current performance, the capability trend is **STABLE, but UNSATISFACTORY**. The system demonstrates a basic understanding of the problem, but its core reasoning ability is flawed. Without significant improvements to the availability reasoning and constraint handling, the system will remain unreliable. The detailed focus on improved availability assessment should produce an upward trend in the next iteration.\n",

It lists the availability of each participant.\n*   **Constraint Awareness:** The system seems to be aware of the constraints related to work hours and participant preferences, as it attempts to incorporate them in its analysis (e.g., acknowledging Emma's preference not to meet on Monday).\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Inaccurate Availability Assessment:** The system makes mistakes in determining the accurate availability of participants based on their schedules. This leads to proposing time slots that are not actually feasible.\n*   **Suboptimal Solution Selection:** Even when potential valid time slots are identified, the system sometimes selects a suboptimal choice or misses the correct solution altogether.\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n\n*   **Flawed Constraint Handling:** The core bottleneck is the system's flawed ability to accurately identify and apply constraints from the schedules to determine participant availability. This undermines the entire solution generation process.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n\n*   **Misinterpretation of Busy Schedules:** The system appears to have difficulty translating the provided busy schedules into accurate availability assessments, often overlooking or misinterpreting busy slots.\n*   **Inconsistent Constraint Application:** Even when the system identifies a potential time slot, it doesn't always consistently apply the constraints to verify its validity, leading to incorrect solution proposals.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\n\nThe most critical problem is **INACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF PARTICIPANT AVAILABILITY based on provided busy schedules**. This stems from errors in the system's ability to correctly interpret and apply the constraints defined by the busy schedules of each participant. The system misses busy times and incorrectly calculates available slots.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n\n*   **information_extraction:** While the system extracts the busy schedules, it doesn't process them accurately. This needs improvement.\n*   **constraint_handling:** Significant improvement is needed to accurately apply constraints defined by busy schedules when determining participant availability.\n*   **solution_verification:** Better verification of proposed solutions against all constraints is crucial to avoid suggesting invalid time slots.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n\n1.  **Develop a more robust algorithm for availability calculation:** Implement a function specifically designed to process the schedule strings, convert them into a consistent data structure (e.g., a list of time intervals), and accurately determine available time slots for each participant. Pay close attention to parsing the time ranges correctly.\n2.  **Implement a stricter solution verification process:** Before proposing a solution, implement a rigorous verification step that checks the proposed time slot against *all* participants' schedules. This can involve iterating through each participant and explicitly confirming their availability during the suggested time.\n3.  **Refine the prompting strategy:** Add few-shot examples to the prompt specifically demonstrating the correct method of parsing busy schedules and determining available time slots. Emphasize the importance of accurately accounting for all constraints.\n4. **Add unit tests for schedule parsing and availability calculation:** Create a set of unit tests that specifically target the schedule parsing and availability calculation logic. These tests should cover various edge cases and ensure the algorithm functions correctly.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification, decision_making\n*   **Sample ID 3:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n*   **Sample ID 4:** information_extraction, constraint_handling, solution_generation, solution_verification\n",
    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a thorough capability assessment of the AI system, based on the provided performance summary, error analysis report, sample execution outputs, and your instructions:\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe raw execution outputs reveal several critical issues:\n\n*   **Incorrect Time Slot Proposals:** The system often proposes time slots that directly contradict the stated constraints (e.g., proposing a time when Joan is explicitly marked as busy). This confirms the \"Inaccurate Availability Assessment\" weakness.\n*   **Misinterpretation of Constraints:** The reasoning chains show a flawed understanding of how to integrate busy schedules. For example, in one case, the system acknowledges Doris's unavailability before 15:00 but still tries to find slots before that time.\n*   **Logical Fallacies:** The system exhibits logical fallacies in its reasoning. For example, it states, \"After 16:30, everyone is free,\" even though Jean is mentioned as being busy from 16:00 - 16:30.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Logic:** Even within the same reasoning chain, the system contradicts itself regarding participant availability, highlighting an inconsistency in applying the logic.\n*   **Hallucination of Availability:** The system sometimes claims someone is free when the schedule clearly indicates they are busy. This indicates a possible over-reliance on assumed availability rather than directly evaluating the schedule strings.\n*   **Reasoning \"noise\":** One of the sample outputs demonstrates excessive \"reasoning\" leading to incorrect conclusion that no solution is possible, then reversing itself and proposing a solution.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary understanding of scheduling constraints but fails to translate this understanding into accurate availability assessment and solution generation. While it attempts to reason about schedules, the reasoning is flawed, inconsistent, and often leads to incorrect conclusions. The core problem is not simply extracting the information, but *reasoning* about the extracted information correctly to determine availability.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Attempts at Reasoning:** The system at least tries to break down the problem and reason about the constraints. This provides a foundation for future improvements.\n*   **Constraint Awareness:** The system is aware of the core constraints (participant schedules, time windows, meeting duration).\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Flawed Availability Reasoning:** The MOST CRITICAL weakness is the inaccurate and inconsistent reasoning about participant availability based on busy schedules. This undermines the entire system's utility.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Constraints:** The system fails to apply constraints consistently and logically.\n*   **Lack of Robust Schedule Parsing:** The system likely lacks a robust and reliable way to parse and process schedule strings into a structured format.\n*   **Compounding Errors:** Errors in reasoning early in the process compound, leading to significantly flawed final answers.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\n**Availability Reasoning:** The single most important capability to focus on improving is the system's ability to accurately and consistently reason about participant availability based on their provided busy schedules.

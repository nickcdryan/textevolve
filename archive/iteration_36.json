  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by using an LLM to select a transformation pattern from a predefined codebook and then applying it to the input grid. The problem is decomposed into three steps: pattern selection, pattern application, and output validation.  The LLM acts as an expert in grid transformation patterns and selects the correct pattern from the codebook, extracts the relevant parameters, and formats the output as a grid.\n\nThe core functions are `main`, `solve_grid_transformation`, and `call_llm`. `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation` which orchestrates the solution, using `call_llm` to interact with the LLM for pattern selection, transformation, and validation.  The overall workflow involves prompting the LLM to select a transformation, applying the transformation based on the selected pattern, and then validating the grid format of the output, retrying if necessary.",

      "text_report": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your requested format.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe system consistently struggles to accurately apply the inferred transformation rule. While it correctly identifies a \"value replacement\" pattern, it fails to pinpoint the exact locations where the replacements should occur. The sample outputs highlight these issues:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system recognizes that '2' should be replaced with '8', but it incorrectly applies this replacement across the entire grid, disregarding the contextual pattern from the training data. The generated output is nearly identical to the ground truth, with very little variance.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system identifies the need to replace '8' with '3', but the pattern of how the values are replaced is arbitrary. The extracted pattern selection indicates some pattern in the training examples, but this is not correctly translated to the transformed grid.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system attempts to replace values adjacent to certain values are replaced with '8'. Again the system fails to accurately extrapolate where to add the value '8' to replace the values in the test input.\n\nThe extracted pattern selections suggests the system can loosely describe what values are used in the transformations, but it is not able to properly replicate the transformations to the grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary capability for pattern recognition and transformation application. However, its overall capability is currently limited due to its inability to accurately generalize and apply complex patterns, especially those involving spatial relationships and conditional logic. This lack of precise location identification is the core issue hindering performance. Its ability to extract information from the training examples is very basic.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Basic):** The system can identify the general type of transformation.\n*   **Transformation Application (Rudimentary):** It can apply the transformation, albeit inaccurately.\n*   **Code Generation:** The system successfully converts the transformed grid into a Python list of lists.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization (Critical):** Fails to generalize the precise rules of transformation from the training data.\n*   **Precise Location Identification (Critical):** Cannot accurately identify the specific locations for value replacement.\n*   **Reasoning Capability (Limited):** Reasoning is primarily limited to value replacement, missing more complex pattern relationships.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**.  Specifically, enhancing the system's ability to learn and accurately apply spatially-dependent and conditionally-dependent patterns.\n\n## ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1.  **Implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Introduce CNNs to better capture spatial relationships within the grid.

    "capability_report_text": "Okay, here's a comprehensive capability report for your AI system based on the provided performance summary, error analysis, sample execution outputs, and your requested format.\n\n## EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe system consistently struggles to accurately apply the inferred transformation rule. While it correctly identifies a \"value replacement\" pattern, it fails to pinpoint the exact locations where the replacements should occur. The sample outputs highlight these issues:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The system recognizes that '2' should be replaced with '8', but it incorrectly applies this replacement across the entire grid, disregarding the contextual pattern from the training data. The generated output is nearly identical to the ground truth, with very little variance.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system identifies the need to replace '8' with '3', but the pattern of how the values are replaced is arbitrary. The extracted pattern selection indicates some pattern in the training examples, but this is not correctly translated to the transformed grid.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** The system attempts to replace values adjacent to certain values are replaced with '8'. Again the system fails to accurately extrapolate where to add the value '8' to replace the values in the test input.\n\nThe extracted pattern selections suggests the system can loosely describe what values are used in the transformations, but it is not able to properly replicate the transformations to the grid.\n\n## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system demonstrates a rudimentary capability for pattern recognition and transformation application. However, its overall capability is currently limited due to its inability to accurately generalize and apply complex patterns, especially those involving spatial relationships and conditional logic. This lack of precise location identification is the core issue hindering performance. Its ability to extract information from the training examples is very basic.\n\n## KEY STRENGTHS\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition (Basic):** The system can identify the general type of transformation.\n*   **Transformation Application (Rudimentary):** It can apply the transformation, albeit inaccurately.\n*   **Code Generation:** The system successfully converts the transformed grid into a Python list of lists.\n\n## KEY WEAKNESSES\n\n*   **Pattern Generalization (Critical):** Fails to generalize the precise rules of transformation from the training data.\n*   **Precise Location Identification (Critical):** Cannot accurately identify the specific locations for value replacement.\n*   **Reasoning Capability (Limited):** Reasoning is primarily limited to value replacement, missing more complex pattern relationships.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT FOCUS\n\nThe single most important capability to focus on improving is **Pattern Generalization**.

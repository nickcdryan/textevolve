  "approach_summary": "The script solves grid transformation problems by first extracting coordinate-based transformation rules from training examples using an LLM, then applying these rules to the test input while validating the transformation based on the local context. Two agent roles are defined: one for extracting the transformation rules and another for applying the rules with local context validation. The problem is decomposed into two main functions: `extract_coordinate_transformation_rules` and `apply_transformation_with_validation`. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates the process by calling `extract_coordinate_transformation_rules` to get the transformation rules and then `apply_transformation_with_validation` to generate the transformed grid, with `call_llm` being used to interact with the Gemini LLM.",

However, the discrepancies between the system's answer and the golden answer indicate logical errors in the grid transformation process.\n\n## STRENGTHS\n*   The system demonstrates the ability to understand the grid structure and perform some kind of transformation.\n*   The system seems to be able to identify the special numbers in the grid (5, 8, 3, 4) and somewhat manipulate other cells related to them.\n*   The system is able to output a JSON-formatted grid as required.\n\n## WEAKNESSES\n*   The system struggles to correctly apply the transformation rules learned from the training examples. The logic behind copying, replacing, or manipulating values within the grid is faulty.\n*   The system incorrectly uses values from the input grid in locations they should not be (e.g., using a '4' instead of an '8' in sample 0).\n*   There's an inconsistency in how the surrounding cells are modified. Sometimes it's a direct copy, other times it's a different number entirely (e.g., replacing zeros with other numbers).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Faulty Pattern Recognition:** The AI fails to accurately identify and replicate the complex patterns of grid transformation demonstrated in the training examples. It picks up some aspects but not the overall logic.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Transformation Rules:** Once a pattern is partially recognized, the rules for modifying the grid are applied inconsistently and incorrectly, leading to numerous errors.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   Values from the input grid are frequently placed in incorrect locations in the output grid.\n*   The system struggles with the relationship between different values and their positions relative to each other.\n*   The AI doesn't generalize well from the training examples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **incorrect pattern recognition and application of transformation rules** in the grid. The system seems to be picking up on some basic elements (like identifying key numbers) but fails to understand the core logic of *how* and *where* to transform the grid based on the given training examples. The system is essentially hallucinating transformation patterns rather than learning and applying them correctly. The fact that \"4\" appears where an \"8\" is needed suggests the system is confused by proximity rather than following a spatial logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Enhance the system's ability to accurately identify complex grid transformation patterns from training examples.\n*   **Rule Application:** Improve the consistency and correctness of applying transformation rules to the test input.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Strengthen the system's understanding of spatial relationships between values in the grid.\n*   **Abstraction:** Develop the capability of the system to form abstract rules instead of relying on direct copying.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Refine the Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** Explore more advanced pattern recognition techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs), which are better suited for spatial data like grids. Consider techniques that help the system learn hierarchical representations of the grid transformations.\n2.  **Implement a Rule-Based System with Explicit Constraints:** Define explicit rules and constraints for grid transformation based on the training examples. This will provide a more structured and controlled approach to the transformation process.\n3.  **Introduce Attention Mechanisms:** Implement attention mechanisms that allow the system to focus on relevant parts of the training examples when learning transformation rules. This can help the system better understand the relationships between different values and their positions in the grid.\n4.  **Increase the Number and Diversity of Training Examples:** Providing more training examples, particularly those with diverse transformation patterns, can help the system generalize better and learn more robust rules.\n5.  **Add intermediate print statements and outputs:** Add these in order to determine why transformations are occurring.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies some key values)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (incorrectly applies transformation rules)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generates an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (does not verify the output against the training patterns)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selects an incorrect solution)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies some key values)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (incorrectly applies transformation rules)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generates an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (does not verify the output against the training patterns)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selects an incorrect solution)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies some key values)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (incorrectly applies transformation rules)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generates an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (does not verify the output against the training patterns)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selects an incorrect solution)\n",

      "text_report": "## AI System Capability Report: Grid Transformation\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**System Version:** (Assumed, based on performance) Initial Prototype\n\n### PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a consistent failure to correctly transform the input grids according to learned patterns.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output grid populates seemingly random cells with '4', '5', and '8'. The placement of these values doesn't correlate logically to the input grid or to expected transformations. There's evidence of the system identifying '5' in the input, but the propagation of related changes is completely off. The excessive use of '0' is also telling; the system seems hesitant to populate unless a \"trigger\" number is identified, and even then, the result is flawed. The presence of a \"4\" where an \"8\" should be (as suggested in the original report) is confirmed.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system outputs a 6x6 grid, demonstrating an ability to modify the grid dimensions. The output values ('0', '1', '2', '3', '5') are present in the input grid, but their arrangement is nonsensical.  It seems there is some rule about having \"1\" near \"3\" and \"2\" near \"5,\" but these are incorrect rules to be learning.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** This grid shows some pattern repetition with \"5\", and sometimes with \"0.\" However, the pattern is incorrectly formed, the grid is modified with numbers not present in the original grid, and the repeating nature suggests some rudimentary replication mechanism gone awry. The \"2\" in the middle row may be another instance of misidentifying a number in the original grid.\n\n**Key Observation:** The system appears to be attempting to implement transformation rules, but these rules are based on *incorrectly* identified patterns in the training data. There is a distinct lack of spatial reasoning.  It copies and pastes values (or related values) in incorrect positions.  Furthermore, there's no evidence of the system *verifying* its output against expected patterns; it generates and outputs without checking consistency. The format of the grid also seems to be incorrect in Sample ID 1 - even if the transformations were correct, the sample is wrong.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits extremely limited capabilities.

Sometimes it's a direct copy, other times it's a different number entirely (e.g., replacing zeros with other numbers).\n\n## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS\n*   **Faulty Pattern Recognition:** The AI fails to accurately identify and replicate the complex patterns of grid transformation demonstrated in the training examples. It picks up some aspects but not the overall logic.\n*   **Inconsistent Application of Transformation Rules:** Once a pattern is partially recognized, the rules for modifying the grid are applied inconsistently and incorrectly, leading to numerous errors.\n\n## ERROR PATTERNS\n*   Values from the input grid are frequently placed in incorrect locations in the output grid.\n*   The system struggles with the relationship between different values and their positions relative to each other.\n*   The AI doesn't generalize well from the training examples.\n\n## PRIMARY ISSUE\nThe primary issue is the **incorrect pattern recognition and application of transformation rules** in the grid. The system seems to be picking up on some basic elements (like identifying key numbers) but fails to understand the core logic of *how* and *where* to transform the grid based on the given training examples. The system is essentially hallucinating transformation patterns rather than learning and applying them correctly. The fact that \"4\" appears where an \"8\" is needed suggests the system is confused by proximity rather than following a spatial logic.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT AREAS\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** Enhance the system's ability to accurately identify complex grid transformation patterns from training examples.\n*   **Rule Application:** Improve the consistency and correctness of applying transformation rules to the test input.\n*   **Spatial Reasoning:** Strengthen the system's understanding of spatial relationships between values in the grid.\n*   **Abstraction:** Develop the capability of the system to form abstract rules instead of relying on direct copying.\n\n## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS\n1.  **Refine the Pattern Recognition Algorithm:** Explore more advanced pattern recognition techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs), which are better suited for spatial data like grids. Consider techniques that help the system learn hierarchical representations of the grid transformations.\n2.  **Implement a Rule-Based System with Explicit Constraints:** Define explicit rules and constraints for grid transformation based on the training examples. This will provide a more structured and controlled approach to the transformation process.\n3.  **Introduce Attention Mechanisms:** Implement attention mechanisms that allow the system to focus on relevant parts of the training examples when learning transformation rules. This can help the system better understand the relationships between different values and their positions in the grid.\n4.  **Increase the Number and Diversity of Training Examples:** Providing more training examples, particularly those with diverse transformation patterns, can help the system generalize better and learn more robust rules.\n5.  **Add intermediate print statements and outputs:** Add these in order to determine why transformations are occurring.\n\n## CAPABILITY MAPPING\n*   **Sample ID 0:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies some key values)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (incorrectly applies transformation rules)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generates an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (does not verify the output against the training patterns)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selects an incorrect solution)\n*   **Sample ID 1:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies some key values)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (incorrectly applies transformation rules)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generates an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (does not verify the output against the training patterns)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selects an incorrect solution)\n*   **Sample ID 2:**\n    *   information_extraction: Partially successful (identifies some key values)\n    *   constraint_handling: Failed (incorrectly applies transformation rules)\n    *   solution_generation: Failed (generates an incorrect output grid)\n    *   solution_verification: Failed (does not verify the output against the training patterns)\n    *   decision_making: Failed (selects an incorrect solution)\n",
    "capability_report_text": "## AI System Capability Report: Grid Transformation\n\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**System Version:** (Assumed, based on performance) Initial Prototype\n\n### PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\n*   Accuracy: 0.00 (0/3)\n*   Error samples: 3/3\n\n### EXECUTION ANALYSIS\n\nThe execution outputs reveal a consistent failure to correctly transform the input grids according to learned patterns.  Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Sample ID 0:** The output grid populates seemingly random cells with '4', '5', and '8'. The placement of these values doesn't correlate logically to the input grid or to expected transformations. There's evidence of the system identifying '5' in the input, but the propagation of related changes is completely off. The excessive use of '0' is also telling; the system seems hesitant to populate unless a \"trigger\" number is identified, and even then, the result is flawed. The presence of a \"4\" where an \"8\" should be (as suggested in the original report) is confirmed.\n*   **Sample ID 1:** The system outputs a 6x6 grid, demonstrating an ability to modify the grid dimensions. The output values ('0', '1', '2', '3', '5') are present in the input grid, but their arrangement is nonsensical.  It seems there is some rule about having \"1\" near \"3\" and \"2\" near \"5,\" but these are incorrect rules to be learning.\n*   **Sample ID 2:** This grid shows some pattern repetition with \"5\", and sometimes with \"0.\" However, the pattern is incorrectly formed, the grid is modified with numbers not present in the original grid, and the repeating nature suggests some rudimentary replication mechanism gone awry. The \"2\" in the middle row may be another instance of misidentifying a number in the original grid.\n\n**Key Observation:** The system appears to be attempting to implement transformation rules, but these rules are based on *incorrectly* identified patterns in the training data. There is a distinct lack of spatial reasoning.  It copies and pastes values (or related values) in incorrect positions.  Furthermore, there's no evidence of the system *verifying* its output against expected patterns; it generates and outputs without checking consistency. The format of the grid also seems to be incorrect in Sample ID 1 - even if the transformations were correct, the sample is wrong.\n\n### CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT\n\nThe system exhibits extremely limited capabilities. While it can understand basic grid structures and identify a few key values, it completely fails to apply complex transformation rules.

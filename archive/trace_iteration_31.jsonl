The Ravens then came within 3 when Alex Collins ran for an 18-yard touchdown to make the score 17-14. The Steelers closed out the half with another field goal kicked by Boswell from 43 yards out to make it 20-14 at halftime.

Pittsburgh scored first in the first quarter when Ben Roethlisberger found Le'Veon Bell for a 20-yard pass to make it 7-0 and the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Steelers moved up 14-0 when Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown. The Ravens got on the board when Joe Flacco found Chris Moore on a 30-yard pass to make it 14-7. The Steelers then moved ahead by double digits again when Chris Boswell put up a 52-yard field goal to make it 17-7. The Ravens then came within 3 when Alex Collins ran for an 18-yard touchdown to make the score 17-14. The Steelers closed out the half with another field goal kicked by Boswell from 43 yards out to make it 20-14 at halftime. In the third quarter, it was all Ravens when they took the lead after scoring 3 times: First when Justin Tucker managed to nail a 47-yard field goal to make it 20-17. This would be followed by Javorious Allen's 1-yard touchdown run as they took the lead 24-20. Flacco then found Patrick Ricard on a 6-yard pass as the Ravens moved up by double digits 31-20. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers managed to come within 2, starting with a 24-yard field goal kicked by Boswell shortening the Ravens' lead to 31-23. This would then be followed up by Roethlisberger connecting with Roosevelt Nix on a 1-yard pass (with a failed 2-point conversion) to make it 31-29. The Ravens managed to pull away when Allen ran for a 9-yard touchdown to make it 38-29. The Steelers then completed the comeback when Bell ran for an 11-yard touchdown to make it 38-36. This would be followed by Boswell kicking a 46-yard field goal to make it 39-38. The Ravens then got the ball back, but Flacco was sacked by T. J. Watt as time expired, sealing the win for the Steelers. With the win, the Steelers improved to 11-2 and were awarded the AFC North division title. The team also managed to win their 9th straight game over a divisional opponent. Pittsburgh notched their first 3-game win streak over the Ravens since defeating them three times during the 2008 season (including the playoffs). The teams' 77 combined points marked the most in series history. The team also swept the Ravens for the first time since 2008.  With the division clinched, the team would win consecutive titles for the first time since the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The Steelers' second consecutive 11+ point comeback victory marked the first time the Steelers had accomplished this feat since coming back from down 14 against the Denver Broncos on December 7, 1997 and then again from down 14 against the New England Patriots on December 13, 1997.\n\nQUESTION: From what distance were two touchdowns runs scored from?\n    Answer: 1 yard, 18 yards\n\n    Passage: In the second quarter, the Steelers moved up 14-0 when Bell ran for a 1-yard touchdown. The Ravens then came within 3 when Alex Collins ran for an 18-yard touchdown to make the score 17-14.

Among the eastern territories, Silesia, Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland, East Prussia was divided between Poland and the USSR, followed by the expulsion of the 9 million Germans from these provinces, as well as the expulsion of 3 million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia to Germany. By the 1950s, every fifth West German was a refugee from the east. The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon line, from which 2 million Poles were expelled; north-east Romania, parts of eastern Finland, and the three Baltic states were also incorporated into the USSR. In an effort to maintain world peace, the Allies formed the United Nations, which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, as a common standard for all member nations. The great powers that were the victors of the war\u2014France, China, Britain, the Soviet Union and the United States\u2014became the permanent members of the UN's Security Council. The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its successor state, the Russian Federation, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

Only paper money was issued. The government issued notes of 1, 5, 10 and 20 drachmae, with the Bank of Greece issuing 50-, 100-, 500-, 1000-, 5000-, and 10,000-drachma notes. This drachma also suffered from high inflation. The government later issued 100-, 500-, and 1000-drachma notes, and the Bank of Greece issued 20,000-and 50,000-drachma notes. Third modern drachma coins The first issue of coins minted in 1954 consisted of holed aluminium 5-, 10- and 20-lepton pieces, with 50-lepton, 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-drachma pieces in cupro-nickel. A silver 20-drachma piece was issued in 1960, replacing the 20-drachma banknote, and also minted only in collector sets in 1965.  Coins in denominations from 50 lepta to 20 drachmae carried a portrait of Paul of Greece (1947\u20131964). New coins were introduced in 1966, ranging from 50 lepta to 10 drachmae, depicting Constantine II of Greece (1964\u20131974). A silver 30 drachma coin for the centennial of Greeces royal dynasty was minted in 1963.  The following year a non-circulating coin of this value was produced to commemorate the royal wedding.  The reverse of all coins was altered in 1971 to reflect the military junta which was in power from 1967 to 1974. This design included a soldier standing in front of the flames of the rising phoenix.\n\nQUESTION: How many years after the first issue of coins was the silver 20-drachma piece issued?"}

P. Losman were unstoppable in the first quarter, connecting for 205 yards and two 83-yard touchdowns. Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score. The 83-yard TDs were career highs for both Losman and Evans and marked the first time in franchise history the Bills have had two 80-yard passes in a single game. David Carr opened 1 for 3 with an interception on his first pass before completing his next 22 throws. Carr finished 25 of 30 for 223 yards and no touchdowns. Carr tied the record held by Mark Brunell, who had 22 consecutive completions in Washington's 31-15 win over the Texans at Reliant Stadium on September 24. He tied Brunell's record on a short pass to Wali Lundy for no gain with 6:19 left. The streak was broken when his pass to Andre Johnson with 5:44 remaining fell short. Lundy cut the lead to 14-7 with a 17-yard run in the first quarter. That score was set up by a 17-yard reception by Eric Moulds on third-and-8.

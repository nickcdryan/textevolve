In the second quarter, Chicago's Brian Griese completed a 39-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian. Afterwards, Minnesota answered with a 67-yard touchdown run from Adrian Peterson. In the third quarter, the Vikings took the lead with 73-yard touchdown run from Peterson for the only score of the period.

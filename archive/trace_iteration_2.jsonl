In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.

Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

The Venetians launched another futile assault before Giustiniani lifted the siege and retreated to Mariano. In September, Johan Ernst van Nassau-Siegen agreed to raise 3,000 men from the Dutch Republic for Venetian service. They arrived in May 1617, followed six months later by another 2,000 . Spanish support was blocked at sea by a flotilla of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships and on land by the war in Mantua. Although Archduke Ferdinand had only 4,000 soldiers to defend Gradisca, he received military, political and financial support from the Spanish as part of a larger agreement: Philip agreed to fight the Venetians and support Ferdinand as the next Holy Roman Emperor in return for the cession of Alsace, Finale Ligure and Piombino. This led to a negotiated settlement between Ferdinand and the Venetians in which many Uskok pirates were executed or exiled, and a permanent Austrian garrison was installed in Senj.\n\nQUESTION: How many Dutch and English warships were blocking Spanish support?"}

Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 \u00b1 0.01 (2.45 \u00b7 108) centimetre\u00b7second\u22122, or approximately 250,000 of Earths gravity.\n\n    Keywords: star, mass, Nu Phoenicis, Gliese 915\n    Simplified Passage: Nu Phoenicis is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

The Texans scored first with 5:55 left after Blue caught a pass from Fitzpatrick to lead 7-0. In the second quarter Ben Roethlisberger was sacked by Watt and fumbled the ball near midfield.

Use these keywords to simplify the passage,\n    focusing on the most relevant sentences.\n\n    Example 1:\n    Question: Which player kicked the only field goal of the game?\n    Passage: Game SummaryComing off their Thanksgiving road win over the Falcons, the Colts went home for a Week 13 AFC South rematch with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.  In the second quarter, the Jaguars got on the board with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Colts replied with Manning and Clark hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, Jacksonville tried to come back as QB David Garrard completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Mercedes Lewis for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with Manning completing a 1-yard TD pass to RB Luke Lawton. Afterwards, Jacksonville tried to come back as Garrard completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt (along with getting the 2-point conversion run). Indianapolis' defense managed to seal the deal. With their season-sweep over the Jaguars, the Colts improved to 10-2. During the game, the Colts gave Garrard his first interception of the year, courtesy of Safety Antoine Bethea.\n\n    Keywords: player, field goal\n    Simplified Passage: In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal.\n\n    Example 2:\n    Question: Which star has a smaller mass, Nu Phoenicis or Gliese 915?\n    Passage: Nu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 \u00b1 0.01 (2.45 \u00b7 108) centimetre\u00b7second\u22122, or approximately 250,000 of Earths gravity.\n\n    Keywords: star, mass, Nu Phoenicis, Gliese 915\n    Simplified Passage: Nu Phoenicis is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun. Gliese 915 has around 85% of the mass of the Sun.\n\n    Example 3:\n    Question: How many yards longer was the longest touchdown pass than the longest field goal?\n    Passage: Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West divisional rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs. After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome. Peyton Manning finished the day with the first 0.0 passer rating of his career.\n\n    Keywords: yards, longest touchdown pass, longest field goal\n    Simplified Passage: the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos.

While the Texans defense held off the Steelers' offense, the offense managed to gain much-needed momentum in the 1st quarter, a place they had previously struggled. The Texans scored first with 5:55 left after Blue caught a pass from Fitzpatrick to lead 7-0. In the second quarter Ben Roethlisberger was sacked by Watt and fumbled the ball near midfield. Houston capitalized on the turnover with a Bullock 39 yard field goal to lead 10-0 with 13:39 left in the 2nd. Houston continued their trend of scoring on each possession with another Bullock field goal (38 yards) to extend their lead to 13-0 with 7:20 left; part of the same drive included the Texans converting on a 4th down and inches. The Steelers finally managed to get on the board with a 44-yard field goal from Shaun Suisham to trail 3-13 with 3:13 left. After forcing a 3 and out for the Texans, the Steelers struck back with a 35-yard touchdown pass from Roerhlisberger to Bryant to trail 10-13 with 1:27 left. After a Houston fumble at their 4-yard line, Pittsburgh took their first lead of the night to lead 17-13 with 1:03 remaining. The Steelers scored off of another Texans turnover after a Fitzpatrick pass was deflected to extend their lead with 0:14 left in the half. Following a series of Houston turnovers in arguably the worst-played three minutes in NFL history, Pittsburgh lead 24-13 at the half. After Suisham made two fourth quarter field goals, from 30 yards (27-16) and 40 yards (30-16), respectively, The Texans tried to rally for the remainder of the game with a Foster TD catch to make it 30-23, and almost pulled off an onside kick recovery, but Pittsburgh managed to avoid a disaster.

This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland-Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland-Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.\n\nQUESTION: What event happened first, Magnus's defection, or the Truce of Jam Zapolski?\n    Extracted Answer: Magnus's defection\n    Correct:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are a precise answer checker."}, "output": "True\n", "status": "success"}

In the first quarter, Indianapolis scored first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 5-yard TD pass to TE Dallas Clark, along with a 48-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne.  In the second quarter, the Jaguars got on the board with RB Maurice Jones-Drew getting a 2-yard TD run. Afterwards, the Colts replied with Manning and Clark hooking up with each other again on a 14-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, Jacksonville tried to come back as QB David Garrard completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE Mercedes Lewis for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with Manning completing a 1-yard TD pass to RB Luke Lawton. Afterwards, Jacksonville tried to come back as Garrard completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt (along with getting the 2-point conversion run). Indianapolis' defense managed to seal the deal. With their season-sweep over the Jaguars, the Colts improved to 10-2.

Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 \u00b1 0.01 (2.45 \u00b7 108) centimetre\u00b7second\u22122, or approximately 250,000 of Earths gravity.\n\n    Keywords: star, mass, Nu Phoenicis, Gliese 915\n    Simplified Passage: Nu Phoenicis is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

In the fourth quarter, the Jaguars drew closer as kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 47-yard field goal. However, the Colts responded with Manning completing a 1-yard TD pass to RB Luke Lawton. Afterwards, Jacksonville tried to come back as Garrard completed a 17-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt (along with getting the 2-point conversion run).

Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, and likely to be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos. The Chiefs increased their lead to 19-0 at halftime, with three more field goals by Santos &#8212 from 49, 34 and 33 yards out. By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

After Peyton Manning became the NFL's all-time leader in regular season passing yardage, the game turned sour for the Broncos. Following a Manning interception, the Chiefs capitalized, with a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Charcandrick West. The Broncos' offense went three-and-out on their next two possessions, and the Chiefs increased their lead to 10-0, with a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Cairo Santos.

By halftime, Manning had thrown three interceptions and the Broncos' offense had earned only one first down. The Broncos went three-and-out on their first possession of the second half, and a 50-yarder field goal by Santos increased the Chiefs' lead to 22-0. After Manning threw his fourth interception of the game on the Broncos' next possession, he was pulled and replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler for the remainder of the game. Osweiler drove the Broncos' into the red zone early in the fourth quarter, but was intercepted by Chiefs' safety Eric Berry. Two plays later, the Chiefs increased their lead to 29-0, when quarterback Alex Smith connected with West on an 80-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos' finally got on the scoreboard with 5:31 remaining in the game, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown (two-point conversion attempt unsuccessful), followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass from Osweiler to wide receiver Andre Caldwell, but the Chiefs' lead was too much for the Broncos to overcome.

The latter score came after the Broncos' defense intercepted Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, and also had a missed extra-point attempt by placekicker Brandon McManus. The Steelers then marched down the field, but had to settle for a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Chris Boswell. The Broncos then increased their lead to 27-10, with Osweiler connecting with Thomas on a 6-yard touchdown pass at the 2-minute warning. However, it would be the Broncos' final scoring play of the game, as the offense was shut out in the second half for the third consecutive week. The Steelers pulled to within 27-13, with Boswell kicking a 41-yard field goal just before halftime. Midway through the third quarter, Roethlisberger connected with wide receiver Antonio Brown on a 9-yard touchdown. Later in the third quarter, Broncos' return specialist Jordan Norwood returned a punt 71 yards for a touchdown; however, the touchdown was nullified by an illegal substitution penalty. Following a Broncos' three-and-out, the Steelers tied the game early in the fourth quarter, with Roethlisberger throwing a 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Markus Wheaton. Each team proceeded to trade punt on their next two possessions, and with just over five minutes remaining, Osweiler was intercepted by Steelers' linebacker Ryan Shazier at the Broncos' 37-yard line, and three plays later, the Steelers re-claimed the lead, with a 23-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Brown. The Broncos then marched down to the Steelers' 36-yard line with 2:17 remaining, but turned the football over on downs. Just before the two-minute warning, the Steelers were attempting to run out the clock, however, Roethlisberger chose to pass the football, and was intercepted by linebacker Brandon Marshall just before the two-minute warning, giving the Broncos one last possession. However, Osweiler threw four straight incompletions, and the Steelers ran out the clock.\n\nQUESTION: Who scored more points, the Steelers or the Broncos?\n    Keywords:\n    Simplified Passage:\n    ", "system_instruction": "You are an expert at simplifying passages by extracting keywords and relevant sentences."}, "output": "Keywords: points, Steelers, Broncos\nSimplified Passage: The Broncos reeled off 20 unanswered points, with quarterback Brock Osweiler throwing a pair of touchdown passes...

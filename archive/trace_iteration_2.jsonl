Determine the population size immediately before the last reset: Since the population grows 5 per minute, after 26 minutes, the population increased by 26 * 5 = 130. So the population immediately before the last reset was 137 - 130 = 7.\n4. Determine the population size after the resets: Since the population resets every hour, there were 8 resets.  Each reset sets the population to 10. So, the population added by resets is 8 * 10 = 80.\n5. Calculate the initial population by accounting for population lost in resets:  If there were no resets, the population after 506 minutes would have been 137 - 80 = 57. This population grew for 506 minutes from the initial population. 506 minutes is 8 hours and 26 minutes. 8 resets added 80 to the population. Without resets, population after 506 minutes would be 137-80 = 57. Initial population: 57 - 506 * 5 = 57 - 2530. Something is wrong.\nLet $P_0$ be the initial population. After the first hour (60 minutes), the population is reset to 10. So, the population at 60 minutes is 10.\nAfter the second hour, the population is reset to 10. So, the population at 120 minutes is 10.\nIn general, after $n$ hours, the population is reset to 10.\n\nThe population at 506 minutes is 137. This means there were 8 resets.\nFrom 480 minutes to 506 minutes (26 minutes), the population grew from 10 to 137. The amount added during those 26 minutes is $137-10 = 127$. So the population grew $127$. But also, the population grows by 5 per minute. So population grew by $26 \\times 5 = 130$. So the population at reset after 480 minutes is $137 - 130 = 7$, contradiction. The population grows 5 per minute, but is set to 10 at the end of the hour. So let $P(t)$ be the population after $t$ minutes where $t$ is in the interval $[60k, 60(k+1))$ then $P(t) = 10 + 5(t - 60k)$. So $P(506) = 10 + 5(506 - 60(8)) = 10 + 5(506 - 480) = 10 + 5(26) = 10 + 130 = 140$. This contradicts the value given of 137.\n\nSince the problem gives population after 506 minutes = 137, we can't assume that the population resets to 10.\nLet $P_0$ be the initial population.\nLet $P(t)$ be the population after $t$ minutes.\nThen $P(t) = P_0 + 5t$ for $0 \\le t < 60$.\nThen it resets. After each hour, the population resets to 10.\nSo, let's say $t = 506 = 8 \\times 60 + 26$.\nThen $P(506) = 137$.\nLet the initial population at $480$ be 10. So the population grew by 26 minutes, then $P(506) = 10 + 5(26) = 140$. This is $137$.\nThe final population is $10 + 5(26) - 3 = 137$.\nLet $P_0$ be the population.\nThen after 60 minutes $P_1 = P_0 + 60(5)$. Then $P_1$ is reset to 10.\n\nAfter the 8th hour, reset to 10.\n$137 = 10 + 5 \\times 26 = 10 + 130 = 140$ not equal to 137.\nThere is a mistake. It seems it should be growing 5 per minutes with no resets.\nThen it should be 137 = $P_0 + 5(506)$.\n$137 = P_0 + 2530$. Then $P_0 = 137 - 2530 = -2393$, impossible.\n\nThe population grew from 480 to 506 minutes. That's 26 minutes. So after 26 minutes, 10 + 26*5 = 140 = 137? It doesn't make sense.\n\n```\n1. Calculate the number of full hours elapsed: 506 // 60 = 8\n2. Calculate the number of minutes elapsed after the last full hour: 506 % 60 = 26\n3. Determine the population size immediately before the last reset. After the 8th hour, the population is reset to 10. Let's say just before the last reset the population size was P. P - 10 = 5 * 60. In this instance, no resets occur\n4.  137 = x + 5 * 506; where x is initial population. 137 = x + 2530.  x = -2393\n5. This isn't right!\n```\nAnswer: There is an inconsistency in the problem.

Calculate the number of full hours elapsed: 506 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 8 hours and 26 minutes. So, there are 8 full hours.\n2. Calculate the number of minutes elapsed after the last full hour: 506 minutes - (8 hours * 60 minutes/hour) = 506 - 480 = 26 minutes.\n3. Determine the population size immediately before the last reset: Since the population grows 5 per minute, after 26 minutes, the population increased by 26 * 5 = 130. So the population immediately before the last reset was 137 - 130 = 7.\n4. Determine the population size after the resets: Since the population resets every hour, there were 8 resets.  Each reset sets the population to 10. So, the population added by resets is 8 * 10 = 80.\n5. Calculate the initial population by accounting for population lost in resets:  If there were no resets, the population after 506 minutes would have been 137 - 80 = 57. This population grew for 506 minutes from the initial population. 506 minutes is 8 hours and 26 minutes. 8 resets added 80 to the population. Without resets, population after 506 minutes would be 137-80 = 57. Initial population: 57 - 506 * 5 = 57 - 2530. Something is wrong.\nLet $P_0$ be the initial population. After the first hour (60 minutes), the population is reset to 10. So, the population at 60 minutes is 10.\nAfter the second hour, the population is reset to 10. So, the population at 120 minutes is 10.\nIn general, after $n$ hours, the population is reset to 10.\n\nThe population at 506 minutes is 137. This means there were 8 resets.\nFrom 480 minutes to 506 minutes (26 minutes), the population grew from 10 to 137. The amount added during those 26 minutes is $137-10 = 127$. So the population grew $127$. But also, the population grows by 5 per minute. So population grew by $26 \\times 5 = 130$. So the population at reset after 480 minutes is $137 - 130 = 7$, contradiction. The population grows 5 per minute, but is set to 10 at the end of the hour. So let $P(t)$ be the population after $t$ minutes where $t$ is in the interval $[60k, 60(k+1))$ then $P(t) = 10 + 5(t - 60k)$. So $P(506) = 10 + 5(506 - 60(8)) = 10 + 5(506 - 480) = 10 + 5(26) = 10 + 130 = 140$.

So the number of integers that are multiples of 2 or 5 is 24 + 9 - 4 = 29. Therefore, the number of integers relatively prime to 50 is 49 - 29 = 20.\n\n4. Count the number of m such that gcd(m, 100) = 4. We want gcd(m, 100) = 4, which means m = 4k, where gcd(k, 25) = 1. Also, since 0 < m < 100, we have 0 < 4k < 100, so 0 < k < 25. We need to find the number of k such that 0 < k < 25 and gcd(k, 25) = 1. The numbers that are not relatively prime to 25 are multiples of 5. The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20 (4 numbers). Therefore, the number of integers relatively prime to 25 is 24 - 4 = 20.\n\n5. Count the number of m such that gcd(m, 100) = 5. We want gcd(m, 100) = 5, which means m = 5k, where gcd(k, 20) = 1. Also, since 0 < m < 100, we have 0 < 5k < 100, so 0 < k < 20. We need to find the number of k such that 0 < k < 20 and gcd(k, 20) = 1. The numbers that are not relatively prime to 20 are multiples of 2 or 5. The multiples of 2 are 2, 4, ..., 18 (9 numbers). The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15 (3 numbers). The multiples of both 2 and 5 (multiples of 10) are 10 (1 number). So the number of integers that are multiples of 2 or 5 is 9 + 3 - 1 = 11. Therefore, the number of integers relatively prime to 20 is 19 - 11 = 8.\n\n6. Sum the counts: 40 + 20 + 20 + 8 = 88.\n\nAnswer: 88\n\nValidation: Correct.\n"}

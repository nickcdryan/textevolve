It was the first journal devoted exclusively to Celtic languages and literature and the oldest significant journal of Celtic studies still in existence today. The emphasis is on (early) Irish language and literature and Continental Celtic languages, but other aspects of Celtic philology and literature (including modern literature) also receive attention. \n\n=== Document 2: Insular Celtic languages ===\nInsular Celtic languages are a group of Celtic languages that originated in Britain and Ireland, in contrast to the Continental Celtic languages of mainland Europe and Anatolia. All surviving Celtic languages are from the Insular Celtic group, including that which is now spoken in Continental Europe; the Continental Celtic languages are extinct. The six Insular Celtic languages of modern times can be divided into: \n\n=== Document 3: Alexei Kondratiev ===\nAlexei Kondratiev (1949\u20132010) was an American author, linguist, and teacher of Celtic languages, folklore and culture. He taught the Irish language and Celtic history at the Irish Arts Center in Manhattan, New York from 1985 until his death on May 28, 2010.

At various times, he taught all six of the living Celtic languages. \n\n=== Document 4: Celtic studies ===\nCeltic studies or Celtology is the academic discipline occupied with the study of any sort of cultural output relating to the Celtic people. This ranges from linguistics, literature and art history, archaeology and history, the focus lying on the study of the various Celtic languages, living and extinct. The primary areas of focus are the six Celtic languages currently in use: Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. \n\n=== Document 5: Continental Celtic languages ===\nThe Continental Celtic languages are the Celtic languages, now extinct, that were spoken on the continent of Europe, as distinguished from the Insular Celtic languages of the British Isles and Brittany. \"Continental Celtic\" is a geographic, not a linguistic, grouping of the ancient Celtic languages. The Continental Celtic languages were spoken by the people known to Roman and Greek writers as \"Keltoi\", \"Celtae\", \"Galli\" and \"Galatae\". These languages were spoken in an arc stretching across from Iberia in the west to the Balkans and Anatolia in the east. \n\n=== Document 6: Celtic nations ===\nThe Celtic nations are territories in western Europe where Celtic languages or cultural traits have survived.

There are about 330 extant languages in Greater Amazonia, almost half of which have fewer than 500 speakers. Meanwhile, only Guajiro has a six-digit number of speakers (about 300,000). Of the 330 total languages, about fifty are isolates, while the remaining ones belong to about 25 different families. Most of the posited families have few members. It is this distribution of many small and historically unrelated speech communities that makes Amazonia one of the most linguistically diverse regions in the world. The precise reasons for this unusual diversity have not yet been conclusively determined, but it is noteworthy that Amazonian languages seem to have had fewer than 10,000 native speakers even before the invasion of European colonists wrought havoc on the societies by which they were spoken. Despite the large-scale diversity, the long-term contact among many of the languages of Greater Amazonia has created similarities between many neighboring languages that are not genetically related. The small tribes can speak English but that would be used as one of their secondary languages \n\n=== Document 9: Celtic art ===\nCeltic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages. \n\n=== Document 10: Pan Celtic Festival ===\nThe Pan Celtic Festival (Irish: \"F\u00e9ile Pan Cheilteach\" ) is a Celtic-language music festival held annually in the week following Easter, since its inauguration in 1971.

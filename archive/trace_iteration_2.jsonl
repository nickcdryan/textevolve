primarily contain zeros, with occasional non-zero values (1, 2, 3, 4, and 8). The transformations seem to involve the movement, replication, and sometimes replacement of these non-zero values.

Here are a few possibilities, along with supporting evidence:\n\n*   **Value Replacement with Propagation/Expansion:** A single value in the initial grid (e.g., '2' in the first grid, '1' or '3' in the third grid, '4' in the seventh grid) triggers a specific value (different than the initial value) to be propagated/expanded across certain rows or columns in the output grid.\n\n    *   *Evidence:* Grid 1 turning into Grid 2 and Grid 3 turning into Grid 4.\n\n*   **Value mirroring or replication:** Some values seem to trigger symmetrical placement of other values in the grid.\n\n    *   *Evidence:* Grid 5 turning into Grid 6 and Grid 7 turning into Grid 8\n\n**Applying a Rule to the First Input Grid**\n\nLet's focus on the transformation from the **first grid** to the **second grid** as an example.\n\n*   **Input Grid:**\n    ```\n    [\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    ```\n\n*   **Output Grid:**\n    ```\n    [\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n    ]\n    ```\n\n*   **Proposed Rule:**  The presence of '2' in `grid[0][5]` *and* '8' in `grid[9][7]` triggers the alternating pattern of '2' and '8' to appear in the first row, which then extends itself to all rows.\n\n    *   **Apply Rule:**\n        Starting with Input Grid\n        ```\n        [\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n        ]\n        ```\n        becomes\n        ```\n        [\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0]\n        ]\n        ```\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n*   **Incomplete Rule Set:**  The identified rules may not explain *all* the transformations across *all* grids.

The new grid size will be (rows = 10, cols = 10).\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0],\n  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3],\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n  [3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3],\n  [0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Steps:**\n\n1. **Dimension Reduction:** Reduce the grid to 10 rows and 10 columns, and remove the right-side columns from consideration. Rows are taken from the top and bottom portions of the input grid.\n\n2. **Base Conversion (Top Half - Rows 0-5):** Convert the values in the first six rows (0-5) based on the base conversion from (8,4,1) to (3,1).\n    *   1 remains 1\n    *   0 remains 0\n\n3. **Base Conversion (Bottom Half - Rows 6-9):** Convert the values in the last four rows (6-9) to zeros.\n\n**Transformed Grid:**\n\n```\n[\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n  [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3],\n  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n\n        Verify if the transformed grid follows the transformation rule based on the test input grid.\n        Explain your reasoning.

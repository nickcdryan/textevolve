The Anglo-Saxon \"axe bearers\" had been amongst the most effective of the city's defenders, but they now attempted to negotiate higher wages from their Byzantine employers, before dispersing or surrendering. The crusaders captured the Blachernae section of the city in the northwest and used it as a base to attack the rest of the city. While attempting to defend themselves with a wall of fire, however, they burned even more of the city. This second fire left 15,000 people homeless.

The first crusade was averted in April 1203, when Bosnians under Ban Kulin promised to practice Christianity according to the Roman Catholic rite and recognized the spiritual supremacy of the pope. Kulin also reaffirmed the secular supremacy of the kings of Hungary over Bosnia. In effect, however, the independence of both the Bosnian Church and Banate of Bosnia continued to grow. At the height of the Albigensian Crusade against French Cathars in the 1220s, a rumour broke out that a \"Cathar antipope\", called Nicetas, was residing in Bosnia. It has never been clear whether Nicetas existed, but the neighbouring Hungarians took advantage of the spreading rumour to reclaim suzerainty over Bosnia, which had been growing increasingly independent. Bosnians were accused of being sympathetic to Bogomilism, a Christian sect closely related to Catharism and likewise dualist. In 1221, the concern finally prompted Pope Honorius III to preach a crusade against the Bosnian heretics. He repeated this in 1225, but internal problems prevented the Hungarians from answering his call. Honorius III's successor, Pope Gregory IX, accused the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia himself of sheltering heretics, in addition to illiteracy, simony, ignorance of the baptismal formula and failure to celebrate mass and sacraments. He was duly deposed in 1233 and replaced with a German Dominican prelate, John of Wildeshausen, the first non-Bosnian Bishop of Bosnia. The same year, Ban Matthew Ninoslav abandoned an unspecified heresy, but this did not satisfy Gregory.","question":"Who was Pope Honorius III's replacement?","answers_spans":{"spans":["Pope Gregory IX"],"types":["span"]},"id":"example_29"}

As two of the eight founding teams of the AFL, the Bills and Patriots celebrated their 50th anniversaries by wearing throwback uniforms from the AFL era, while the officials also wore red-striped uniforms such as those worn by AFL officials. Following a Patriots three-and-out to open the game, the Bills punted to give the Patriots the ball at their own 17-yard line. Nine players later, the Patriots were unable to convert on third down, setting kicker Stephen Gostkowski up for a 41-yard field goal try. He missed it wide right, giving the Bills the ball at their own 32-yard line. Bills quarterback Trent Edwards scrambled for 16 yards to move the Bills into Patriots territory before a Fred Jackson run gained another 16 yards. Jackson was filling in for suspended starter Marshawn Lynch; Patriots linebacker and 2008 Defensive Rookie of the Year Jerod Mayo suffered a sprained MCL on the play and did not return. The next play, a dump-off pass to Jackson, gained 21 yards and put the Bills in the red zone. Two plays later, Edwards hit rookie tight end Shawn Nelson for an 11-yard touchdown, giving the Bills a 7-0 lead. The Patriots next drive was a three-and-out, ending on an Aaron Schobel sack of quarterback Tom Brady on third down. The Bills punted back to the Patriots early in the second quarter, setting the table for a 14-play, 72-yard Patriots drive that culminated on a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Fred Taylor to tie the game. Despite a 16-yard dump-off to Jackson on the Bills' next drive, they punted back to the Patriots before reaching midfield. On the very next play, a Brady pass intended for running back Sammy Morris was intercepted by Schobel and returned 26 yards for a touchdown, giving the Bills a 14-7 lead. Brady was more accurate on his next possession, throwing passes of 14 yards to tight end Benjamin Watson and wide receiver Wes Welker to move into Bills territory, and then hitting wide receiver Randy Moss on a 31-yard strike within the two-minute warning. The drive stalled in the Bills' red zone, and the Patriots were forced to settle for a 20-yard Gostkowski field goal as the first half expired, cutting the Bills' lead to 14-10. Aided by more Jackson yardage and a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty on Vince Wilfork, the Bills moved close to midfield on the opening drive of the second half before punting and pinning the Patriots at their own 3-yard line. The Patriots would advance to the Bills' 36-yard line on 12 plays, but an incomplete pass on third down set up a fourth down conversion try, which failed on another incomplete pass. Three plays later, Edwards hit new target Terrell Owens for the first time in the game, good for 27 yards to put the Bills in Patriots territory. However, a run for a loss and a Tully Banta-Cain sack of Edwards set up a 3rd-and-20 situation, where the Bills failed to convert, forcing a 40-yard Rian Lindell field goal. After a punt, the Patriots began an 11-play drive that spanned into the fourth quarter, ending it on a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal that cut the Bills' lead to 17-13. The Bills responded by embarking on a 14-play, 62-yard drive that took more than six minutes off the clock and extended the Bills' lead to 24-13 on a 10-yard Jackson touchdown on a dump-off from Edwards. With 5:25 remaining in the game and down by 11 points, the Patriots shifted into their two-minute, pass-only offense, moving the ball 81 yards on 11 plays in 3:26 and scoring on an 18-yard Watson touchdown pass from Brady. The Patriots' two-point conversion try failed, keeping them within five points of the Bills. On the ensuing kickoff, Bills second-year returner Leodis McKelvin chose to return the kickoff out of the end zone, despite having his team's onside kick return unit on the field. Safety Brandon Meriweather hit McKelvin at the Bills' 31-yard line, which allowed linebacker Pierre Woods to come in from the side and strip McKelvin of the ball. Gostkowski recovered it at the same spot. Following the two-minute warning, the Patriots offense came back out onto the field. On the third play of the drive, Brady hit Watson on a nearly identical end zone route for a 16-yard touchdown, which was upheld by official review. The Patriots two-point attempt failed again, holding their lead to one point over the Bills. With 45 seconds remaining, the Bills began their next drive and were able to reach their own 40-yard line before another Banta-Cain sack pushed them back to the 30-yard line. The next play was a last-minute deseperation multiple-lateral play that fell short for the Bills, giving the Patriots a 25-24 win, their first victory of the season.","question":"how many more wins than losses did the Pacers finish the season at?","answers_spans":{"spans":["18"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_35"}

The Qing had the support of the majority of Han Chinese soldiers and the Han elite, as they did not join the Three Feudatories. Different sources offer different account of the Han and Manchu forces deployed against the rebels. According to one, 400,000 Green Standard Army soldiers and 150,000 Bannermen served on the Qing side during the war. according to another, 213 Han Chinese Banner companies, and 527 companies of Mongol and Manchu Banners were mobilized by the Qing. According to a third, mustered the Qing a massive army of more than 900,000 Han Chinese to fight the Three Feudatories. Fighting in northwestern China against Wang Fuchen, the Qing put Bannermen in the rear as reserves while they used Han Chinese Green Standard Army soldiers and Han Chinese Generals like Zhang Liangdong, Wang Jinbao, and Zhang Yong as their main military force. The Qing thought that Han Chinese soldiers were superior at fighting other Han people and so used the Green Standard Army as their main army against the rebels instead of Bannermen. As a result, after 1676, the tide turned in favor of the Qing forces. In the northwest, Wang Fuchen surrendered after a three-year-long stalemate, while Geng Jingzhong and Shang Zhixin surrendered in turn as their forces weakened.","question":"How many sources claimed a total of 900000 soldiers fighting against the Three Feudatories?","answers_spans":{"spans":["1"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_37"}

In hope of subsidies, Charles XI of Sweden had entered the anti-French Triple Alliance with the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England, which broke apart when Charles II of England rapproached France in 1670, after the War of Devolution. In April 1672, Sweden and France concluded an alliance, with France promising 400,000 riksdalers of subsidies in peace time, to be raised to 600,000 in war time, for Sweden maintaining a 16,000 men strong army in her German dominions. Also, Sweden maintained good relations to the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp south of Denmark. By September 1674, Sweden had enlarged her army to 22,000 men after France had increased the subsidies to 900,000 riksdalers, which she threatened to withdraw if Sweden was not using this army, stationed in Swedish Pomerania, for an attack on her adversaries. By December, the Swedish army had grown to 25,000 to 26,000 men, 4,000 to 5,000 of whom stationed in Bremen, 2,000 to 3,000 in Wismar, 6,000 to 7,000 in Pomeranian garrisons, and 13,000 free to operate under Lord High Constable and field marshal Carl Gustaf Wrangel.","question":"How many years after Charles II of England rapproached France did Sweden and France conclude an alliance?","answers_spans":{"spans":["2"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_75"}

So, in 1910 China invaded Tibet, and the Dalai Lama fled to India.\" In the late winter of 1910, the Manchu government in Beijing was furious with the 13th Dalai Lama. His government, having witnessed the dissolution of its domains in Khams by Qing administrators, and fearing that the amban in Lhasa was going to eliminate its temporal authority, cut this imperial officer off from the sustenance that the Tibet government had guaranteed him in a prior agreement with the Qing court. When a relief column arrived in Lhasa from Sichuan to break the amban out of his isolation, the Dalai Lama fled for British India. However, the direct rule over Tibet proved short-lived: after the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution and the Xinhai Lhasa turmoil in 1911-1912, Qing rule essentially ended in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet.

In 1590, the Spanish landed a considerable force in Brittany to assist the French Catholic League, expelling the English and Huguenot forces from much of the area. Henry IV's conversion to Catholicism in 1593 won him widespread French support for his claim to the throne, particularly in Paris , a city that he had unsuccessfully besieged in 1590. However, in 1594 Anglo-French forces were able to end Spanish hopes of using the large port of Brest as a launching point for an invasion of England by capturing Fort Crozon. The French civil war turned increasingly against the hardliners of the French Catholic League. With the signing of the Triple Alliance in 1596 between France, England and the Dutch, Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the Spanish took Calais. In September 1597 Anglo-French forces under Henry retook Amiens, just six months after the Spanish took the city, bringing to a halt a string of Spanish victories. The first tentative talks on peace had already begun before the battle. The League hardliners started to lose  ground and popular support throughout France to a resurgent Henry. In addition Spanish finances were at breaking point because of fighting wars in France, the Netherlands and against England. Therefore, a deeply ill Philip decided to end his support for the League and to finally recognize the legitimacy of Henry's accession to the French throne. Without Spanish support the last League hardliners were quickly defeated.

While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and were not equipped to do so.

While the Bears punted on their first drive, Kyle Fuller recorded his first interception since 2015 when he yanked the ball from Louis Murphy's hands, which set up Mitchell Trubisky's eight-yard touchdown pass to Dontrelle Inman. Gould added a 28-yard field goal in the second quarter to narrow the gap to one point, but Tarik Cohen responded with a 61-yard punt return touchdown; after catching the punt at his 39-yard line, Cohen ran back to his 24, moved to his right, then ran forward for the touchdown. With 24 seconds left in the first half, Gould kicked his third field goal (35 yards), followed by one from 34 yards in the third quarter to put the 49ers ehind by two. Early in the fourth quarter, Cohen returned a punt for 67 yards to the 49ers' 16-yard line, but Ben Braunecker was penalized for an illegal block in the back to negate the play and force the Bears to start at their own 14. Although the offense was able to reach 49ers territory, it could not progress further and the Bears eventually punted. Pinned at his eight with 5:27 remaining in the game, Garoppolo led the 49ers downfield to set up Gould's game-winning 24-yard field goal with four seconds left. On the final kickoff, Josh Bellamy handed the ball to Cohen, who threw to Eddie Jackson before the play was stopped as Cohen's lateral was a forward pass. The loss dropped the Bears to 3-9, their fourth straight losing season and worst stretch since they had five consecutive from 1996 to 2000. It was also the Bears' fifth straight loss, the first such losing streak since Marc Trestman's final season as the Bears head coach in 2014.","question":"How many field goals did Robbie Gould kick from longer than 25 yards and less than 35 yards?","answers_spans":{"spans":["2"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_133"}

After the successive battlefield defeats, the bickering between the Confederation's two main powers broke out in full force. Sawlon II of Mohnyin, who had only grudgingly agreed to Hkonmaing's takeover of the Ava throne, blamed Hkonmaing for the defeats, and now planned to put Sithu Kyawhtin I of Salin on the Ava throne. In April\/May 1545, Sawlon II sent Sithu Kyawhtin with an army , which went on to occupy Sagaing, the city directly across the Irrawaddy from Ava. During the rainy season, c. September 1545, Hkonmaing died, and was succeeded by his son Narapati III. The new king promptly sent a mission to Pegu to secure friendly relations in exchange for his recognition of the new de facto border between the two kingdoms. Tabinshwehti accepted the offer. Toungoo's decisive victory gave the upstart kingdom control of all of central Burma, and cemented its emergence as the largest polity in Burma since the fall of Pagan Empire in 1287. Indeed, \"there was once more a king in Burma\". In the following years, Ava and Mohnyin-backed Sagaing would be locked in a war until 1551, while an emboldened Toungoo would turn its attention to conquering Arakan in 1545-47, and Siam in 1547-49.","question":"How many months after Sawlon II sent Sithu Kyawhtin with an army did Hkonmaing die?","answers_spans":{"spans":["4"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_152"}

Coming into the game, the Bengals held a one-game advantage over the Browns in the all-time series, 34-33 . However, the Browns defeated the Bengals in a high-scoring contest, 51-45, which saw 12 offensive touchdowns - and tied the overall series between the two teams at 34 wins each. The game opened with a 13-yard touchdown pass from Carson Palmer to running back Rudi Johnson - the first receiving touchdown of his career. After a Cleveland punt, safety Sean Jones intercepted a Palmer pass intended for Chad Johnson, which gave the Browns possession. However, they were unable to score a touchdown, and scored with a 39-yard Phil Dawson field goal instead. After a Bengals punt, Dawson kicked another 39-yard field goal before the end of the quarter. The Bengals began the second quarter with Rudi Johnson fumbling the football, which was recovered by cornerback Leigh Bodden. Derek Anderson, starting after the team's trade of Charlie Frye during the week, completed a pass to Joe Jurevicius in the back of the endzone for a 17-yard touchdown, putting the Browns ahead 13-7. The Bengals countered with another touchdown pass, this time a 23-yard pass to T. J. Houshmandzadeh. Browns head coach Romeo Crennel challenged the ruling on the field that the receiver was in bounds on the catch, but the officials upheld the call. On the ensuing kickoff, Josh Cribbs returned the ball 88&#160;yards to the Bengals' 11-yard line. The drive was capped off with a 9-yard pass from Anderson to Jurevicius, giving him his second touchdown reception of the game and putting the Browns ahead 20-14. The Bengals answered the Browns' touchdown pass with another score of their own, this time a 22-yard pass to Chad Johnson. Johnson was wide open in the endzone, uncovered because Bodden had slipped. After his catch, Johnson attempted to find the Browns' Dawg Pound so he could jump into it and keep his pregame promise to do so if he scored. He was unable to do so, though, since he had scored in the end zone opposite the Dawg Pound. Following the Bengals' score, the Browns answered with a 97-yard kickoff return to Cincinnati's four-yard line by Cribbs; however, due to several penalties on the play, it was called back. Though the team was penalized, Anderson eventually threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Kellen Winslow II to give the Browns a 27-21 lead at halftime. The Bengals began the third quarter with a Dexter Jackson interception of Anderson, and the team gained ground on the Browns with a 20-yard Shayne Graham field goal. On the Browns' next drive, Anderson hooked up with Braylon Edwards for a 34-yard touchdown pass, allowing the Browns to increase their lead to ten points again, 34-24. However, just as in the first half, the Bengals answered the Browns' score with a score of their own, a 14-yard touchdown pass to Chad Johnson. Carrying out his promise, Johnson leaped into the Dawg Pound, where a fan poured beer onto him. With the Bengals only trailing by three points, running back Jamal Lewis exploded out of the backfield and ran 66&#160;yards for a touchdown to increase the Browns' lead back to ten points. Five minutes later, on the next drive, Carson Palmer hit T. J. Houshmandzadeh, this time a 5-yard touchdown pass, to bring the Browns' lead back to three. The Browns' next drive was cut short on a fourth-and-short rushing attempt by fullback Lawrence Vickers; however, the Bengals were forced to punt on their next drive, and managed to down the ball inside the Browns' ten-yard line. The Browns answered the Bengals' third-quarter touchdown with a 37-yard pass from Anderson to Edwards, again increasing the lead to ten points, 48-38. After another punt by the Bengals, Phil Dawson kicked his third field goal of the game, from 18&#160;yards, to give the Browns a 13-point lead. With time running down, Palmer led his team to yet another score, this time on a 7-yard pass to Glenn Holt, to cut the Browns' lead to six points. However, this would be the final scoring drive of the game; the Browns punted on their next possession, which was followed by a Leigh Bodden interception of a Palmer pass in Browns territory as Palmer was attempting to lead his team on a quick scoring drive. The play was reviewed by officials but upheld, allowing Derek Anderson to take a knee to run the clock out and win his first game as a starting quarterback. Browns' quarterback Derek Anderson tied a franchise record with five touchdown passes in the game. Running back Jamal Lewis also became the first Browns running back in more than 20 years, rushing for 215&#160;yards on 22 carries and scoring a touchdown. Wide receiver Braylon Edwards and tight end Kellen Winslow also added more than 100&#160;yards receiving each: Edwards had eight receptions for 146&#160;yards with two touchdowns, and Winslow had six catches for 100&#160;yards and a touchdown. The teams' combined score at the end of the game was 96 points; the teams together scored 106 points in a game in 2004. The rivals now own two of the top scoring games in the history of the league. Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer also set a franchise record with his six touchdown passes, while wide receiver Chad Johnson became the franchise's all-time leader in receiving yards. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game. For his performance against the Bengals, quarterback Derek Anderson was named the AFC Player of the Week.

After futile sieges of the defences of Calenberg and Hildesheim by troops from Hildesheim or Brunswick as well as numerous trails of devastation and plundering by both sides against the civilian population, the two sides finally met on 28 June 1519 at the Battle of Soltau . The Hildesheim army scored an emphatic victory against the Brunswick-Welf troops, killing some 3,500 men and capturing one of their leaders, Eric of Calenberg, as well as many of the nobles. This signalled the end of the opening phase of the war. However, an appeal to the newly elected emperor, Charles V, who had a good relationship with Wolfenb\u00fcttel, saw the situation entirely reversed at a political level. The ruling imposed by Charles V provided for the surrender of all conquered territory and release of all the prisoners, and thus ruled very much against the Hildesheim side. Because it was ignored by the bishop and his allies, the emperor's decision was followed in 1522 by the imposition of an imperial ban, the execution of which was assigned to the princes of Wolfenb\u00fcttel and Calenberg. Whilst Henry of L\u00fcneburg had already gone into exile in France in 1520 having transferred the reins of power to his sons and in doing so keeping the Principality of L\u00fcneburg out of the subsequent conflict, there were renewed military clashes between the Hildesheim prince-bishop and his opponents that were not finally resolved  until the so-called 'field peace'  of 15 October 1521. Hildesheim had won militarily, but lost politically.","question":"How many years were there battles and skirmishes for?","answers_spans":{"spans":["4"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_170"}

The Patriots punted on their first drive of the game, giving the Jets the ball at their own 3-yard line. After a 1-yard Thomas Jones run, Jets quarterback Clemens threw an interception to Eugene Wilson, who returned it for a touchdown. Clemens was hit by Seymour and suffered an ankle injury on the play and did not return to the game. Wilson also became the Patriots' 21st player to score a touchdown on the season, tying an NFL record set by the Denver Broncos in 2000 and Los Angeles Rams in 1987. On their ensuing possession, the Jets gained 49&#160;yards on an option play to running back Leon Washington, but then failed a fourth down conversion from the Patriots' 17-yard line. With 6:36 remaining in the first quarter, the Patriots began a drive that ended 17 plays later, in the 2nd quarter, on a 26-yard Gostkowski field goal. After a Jets punt, the Patriots moved the ball to their own 40-yard line when a Chris Hanson punt attempt was blocked by David Bowens and returned for a touchdown to cut the Patriots' lead to 10-7. On the Jets' next possession, Washington blocked a Graham punt attempt to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 3-yard line. A 1-yard Maroney touchdown run a play later gave the Patriots a 17-7 lead going into halftime. Gostkowski's extra point, his 67th of the season, broke Uwe von Schamann's single-season record of 66 with the Miami Dolphins in 1984. A Jets punt gave the Patriots the ball at their own 9-yard line early in the third quarter. After two Maroney rushes for a total of 5&#160;yards, a Brady pass on third down intended to Moss was intercepted by Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. The Jets moved into the red zone, but were driven back on a Thomas Jones run for a 1-yard loss and a delay of game penalty. On third down, Pennington completed a 10-yard pass to Baker, who then fumbled. Wilson recovered it for the Patriots, but a subsequent exchange of punts kept the third quarter scoreless. Another Hanson punt began the fourth quarter, giving the Jets the ball from their own 15-yard line. The Jets then embarked upon a 17-play drive where Pennington completed 10 passes on 12 attempts, none for more than 14&#160;yards. The drive ended at the Patriots' 15-yard line, where the Jets cut the Patriots' lead to 17-10 on a 33-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Patriots' ensuing drive began with two incompletions intended for Moss. On third down, Brady completed a 16-yard pass to Moss, and then a 46-yard pass to Moss to give the Patriots the ball at the Jets' 14-yard line. A 4-yard Maroney run, incompletion, and sack for a loss of 6&#160;yards set up a 33-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Jets' next possession ended in a 35-yard missed Nugent field goal, and the Jets failed to score on their final drive to give the Patriots a 20-10 win. It gave the Patriots a 14-0 record, tying them with the 1972 Miami Dolphins for the best record to start a season.

According to a 1900 British report compiled by Alfred Biliotti, who is considered to have heavily relied on Greek intelligence agents, starting from 1897, the members of the Exarchist committees had embarked upon a systematic and extensive campaign of executions of the leading members of the Greek side. Moreover, Bulgarian Komitadjis, pursued a campaign of extermination of Greek and Serbian teachers and clergy. On the other hand, there were attacks by Greek Andartes on many Macedonian Bulgarian villages, with the aim of forcing their inhabitants to switch their allegiance from the Exarchate back to the Patriarchate and accept Greek priest and teachers, but they also carried out massacres against the civilian population, especially in the central parts of Macedonia in 1905 and in 1906. One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani , which was an aggressive pro-Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands.

The Raiders needed a win and a Miami Dolphins loss or a win and a Denver Broncos loss to clinch a playoff berth. Oakland started well, recovering a muffed fumble by Tyreek Hill on a punt following their first drive and setting them up at the Kansas City 38-yard line. However, the Raiders had to settle for a field goal by Sebastian Janikowsi to take the early 3-0 lead. It would be the last lead the Raiders enjoyed on the night. Oakland's offense could muster little for most of the first half including after the Raider defense stopped KC on a fourth and one at the Oakland 27. The Chiefs took the lead early in the second quarter on a 36-yard pass from Alex Smith to Hill to make the score 7-3. After a four-and-out possession for the Raiders, the Chiefs again went down the field scoring on a Charcandrick West three-yard touchdown run. Following another Raiders short offensive possession, Hill returned a punt 78 yards for a touchdown to extend the Chief lead to 21-3. With six minutes remaining in the half, the Raiders went up-tempo and moved the ball down the field capping the drive with a one-yard touchdown run by Latavius Murray with 14 seconds remaining. At the half, the Raiders trailed 21-10. To begin the second half, the Raider defense stepped up intercepting Smith on the second play of the half and giving the offense the ball at the KC 23. However, the offense was shut down by the KC defense and settled for another Janikowski field goal, bringing them within a touchdown of the Chiefs at 21-13. On the next offensive play for the Chiefs, Khalil Mack sacked and stripped Smith of the ball and the Raiders recovered at the KC 18-yard line. The offense again managed little and was forced to settle for a field goal attempt. However, a bad snap resulted in Marquette King being tackled for three-yard loss.

Also in 1913, the Irish Citizen Army was founded by the trade unionists and socialists James Larkin and James Connolly following a series of violent incidents between trade unionists and the Dublin police in the Dublin lock-out. In June 1914, Nationalist leader John Redmond forced the Volunteers to give his nominees a majority on the ruling committee. When, in September 1914, Redmond encouraged the Volunteers to enlist in the British Army, a faction led by Eoin MacNeill broke with the Redmondites, who became known as the National Volunteers, rather than fight for Britain in the war. Many of the National Volunteers did enlist, and the majority of the men in the 16th  Division of the British Army had formerly served in the National Volunteers. The Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army launched the Easter Rising against British rule in 1916, when an Irish Republic was proclaimed. Thereafter they became known as the Irish Republican Army . Between 1919-21 the IRA claimed to have a total strength of 70,000, but only about 3,000 were actively engaged in fighting against the Crown.

Griffin started his career as well as possible, going 6\/6 on his opening possession, setting up a 37-yard field goal by new Redskins kicker Billy Cundiff. However, the lead would be short lived as Six-time Pro Bowl QB Drew Brees marched his Saints down the field, culminating in a 20-yard touchdown pass to star tight end Jimmy Graham. For the first time, Griffin's resolve was tested, as he marched onto the field trailing for the first time. Griffin was unfazed, and after not completing a pass ahead of the line of scrimmage on his first possession, Griffin connected with fellow new Redskins Pierre Gar&#231;on for an 88-yard strike to give Washington a 10-7 lead. In the second quarter, Washington's lead continued to grow, as Griffin found second-year man Aldrick Robinson for a 5-yard touchdown pass to extend Washington's advantage to 17-7. Cundiff added a 41-yard field goal to give Washington a 20-7 advantage. On the next Saints ensuing possession, Brees found Marques Colston who was on his way to an apparent touchdown, but fumbled in the Washington endzone, which resulted in a touchback. Appearing to go into the second half up 20-7, Saverio Rocca's punt was blocked and returned four yards for a touchdown by Saints special teamer Courtney Roby to make it 20-14 at the half. Getting the ball to start the second half, Washington extended its advantage by way of a 1-yard rush TD by rookie running back Alfred Morris. Washington would again expand upon its lead via Cundiff's 37-yarder, to make it 30-14 Washington. Saints kicker Garrett Hartley hit a 21-yard field goal to close the third quarter scoring at 30-17. In the fourth, Washington again pushed its advantage to 16 when Billy Cundiff nailed his fourth field goal of the day, this one from 45 yards. However, the Saints would not go quietly. On the Saints' ensuing possession, Brian Orakpo dropped an interception on 3rd and 10 that would've all but sealed the deal. With this new break, Brees made the Redskins pay, as Lance Moore beat Madieu Williams to the endzone for a 33-yard touchdown on 4th-and-10. Darren Sproles scored on the two-point conversion to cut the Redskins lead to 33-25. The Redskins could not amass a first down on their next drive, and Drew Brees got the ball back with the crowd sensing a comeback. However, Brees overthrew his intended receiver on the first play of the drive, and DeJon Gomes returned the interception to the Saints 3-yard line, and on the next play, Alfred Morris extended the advantage to 40-25. However, the Saints continued to battle. It took Brees less than one minute to march New Orleans down the field and find Darren Sproles for a 2-yard touchdown pass, and the Saints again pulled within 8. The Redskins got the ball back and were able to nearly run out the clock, but gave Brees one last chance. However, fortunately for the Redskins, Brees' Hail Mary pass on the final play of the game fell short of the intended target and was intercepted by Reed Doughty to preserve the 40-32 upset win.

The Anatolian corps and the Janissaries were both heavy infantry troops. Mehmed posted his river vessels mainly to the northwest of the city to patrol the marshes and ensure that the fortress was not reinforced. They also kept an eye on the Sava river to the southwest to avoid the infantry from being outflanked by Hunyadi's army.

Griffin started his career as well as possible, going 6\/6 on his opening possession, setting up a 37-yard field goal by new Redskins kicker Billy Cundiff. However, the lead would be short lived as Six-time Pro Bowl QB Drew Brees marched his Saints down the field, culminating in a 20-yard touchdown pass to star tight end Jimmy Graham. For the first time, Griffin's resolve was tested, as he marched onto the field trailing for the first time. Griffin was unfazed, and after not completing a pass ahead of the line of scrimmage on his first possession, Griffin connected with fellow new Redskins Pierre Gar&#231;on for an 88-yard strike to give Washington a 10-7 lead. In the second quarter, Washington's lead continued to grow, as Griffin found second-year man Aldrick Robinson for a 5-yard touchdown pass to extend Washington's advantage to 17-7. Cundiff added a 41-yard field goal to give Washington a 20-7 advantage. On the next Saints ensuing possession, Brees found Marques Colston who was on his way to an apparent touchdown, but fumbled in the Washington endzone, which resulted in a touchback. Appearing to go into the second half up 20-7, Saverio Rocca's punt was blocked and returned four yards for a touchdown by Saints special teamer Courtney Roby to make it 20-14 at the half. Getting the ball to start the second half, Washington extended its advantage by way of a 1-yard rush TD by rookie running back Alfred Morris. Washington would again expand upon its lead via Cundiff's 37-yarder, to make it 30-14 Washington. Saints kicker Garrett Hartley hit a 21-yard field goal to close the third quarter scoring at 30-17. In the fourth, Washington again pushed its advantage to 16 when Billy Cundiff nailed his fourth field goal of the day, this one from 45 yards. However, the Saints would not go quietly. On the Saints' ensuing possession, Brian Orakpo dropped an interception on 3rd and 10 that would've all but sealed the deal. With this new break, Brees made the Redskins pay, as Lance Moore beat Madieu Williams to the endzone for a 33-yard touchdown on 4th-and-10. Darren Sproles scored on the two-point conversion to cut the Redskins lead to 33-25.

The Redskins got the ball back and were able to nearly run out the clock, but gave Brees one last chance. However, fortunately for the Redskins, Brees' Hail Mary pass on the final play of the game fell short of the intended target and was intercepted by Reed Doughty to preserve the 40-32 upset win.

With 11:19 remaining, Chris Polk scored on a 10-yard run to increase the score to 40-11, added by Brandon Boykin intercepting Cutler and scoring on a 54-yard return. Afterwards, Josh McCown filled in for Cutler. The Eagles scored again after Bryce Brown ran 65 yards for the touchdown to make the final score 54-11, the biggest blowout since a 47-0 loss to the Houston Oilers in 1977 and the second-most points allowed in team history, behind a 55-20 loss to Detroit in 1997.

On 11 March after a two weeks' bombardment which destroyed many of the fortified structures around the city, the final assault started with Allied forces enjoying a crushing superiority over the Ottoman garrison. Under the command of General Nikola Ivanov, the Bulgarian 2nd Army with 106,425 men and two Serb divisions with 47,275 men conquered the city, with the Bulgarians suffering 8,093 and the Serbs 1,462 casualties. The Ottoman casualties for the entire Adrianople campaign reached 23,000 killed. The number of prisoners is less clear. The Ottoman Empire began the war with 61,250 men in the Adrianople fortress. Richard Hall notes that 60,000 men were captured. Adding to the 33,000 killed, the modern Turkish General Staff History notes that 28,500 man survived captivity leaving only 10,000 men unaccounted for as possibly captured . Bulgarian losses for the entire Adrianople campaign amounted to 7,682. This was the last and decisive battle that was necessary for a quick end to the war, even though it is speculated that the fortress would have fallen eventually due to starvation.

The game was broadcast on NBC Sunday Night Football, the ninth consecutive year that a Bears-Packers was held in prime time. Entering the game, Jay Cutler had struggled against the Packers, with a 67.0 passer rating, the lowest against any team. He also had thrown 13 touchdowns against 19 interceptions, and heading into the game, led the league in turnovers with 12, which led to 44 total points by opponents. However, the Bears' rushing attack took on the Packers' worst-ranked run defense, which had allowed 153.5 yards per game on 32.1 rushing attempts. The offense had to avoid long-distance drives, as they were ranked 29th in the NFL in points scored outside the red zone with 31. On defense, the Bears' rushing defense faced a Green Bay rushing game that was one of ten teams in the NFL to average less than 100 yards per game with 97.5 yards on 24.3 attempt, which ranked 26th, ahead of the Bears by one spot. However, the Packers also averaged 4.02 yards per carry and 4.3 yards per carry on first down. The Bears' pass defense also had to face Aaron Rodgers, who ranked third in the league with 8.22 yards per pass. In addition, the team had to be wary in the event they attempted to blitz; Rodgers had the highest passer rating against the blitz with 130.71, along with eight touchdowns and one interception. Over their previous five games, the Packers had scored an average of 33.6 points, while the Bears had allowed 32 average points in their last five games. The Packers were seven-point favorites, and the game's over\/under of 53.5 points is the highest total of week ten games. Terrance Mitchell, Khaseem Greene, Darryl Sharpton, Eben Britton, Blake Annen, David Bass, and DeDe Lattimore were the inactives for the game. The Bears won the coin toss, and received, but punted after their first drive. From their own 29-yard line, the Packers drove to the Bears' one, where Rodgers threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Bostick. On the second play of the Bears' next drive, Cutler was intercepted by Micah Hyde, and the Packers converted the turnover into a Rodgers' four-yard touchdown pass to Andrew Quarless. After the Bears were forced to punt again, the Packers' drive (which lasted into the second quarter) ended with Rodgers throwing a 73-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson, and scored again after the Bears punted for the fourth consecutive time, this time on Rodgers' 40-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. On Chicago's next possession, the offense reached the Packers' four-yard line, but on 4th down, Cutler's pass to Alshon Jeffery was incomplete, and from their own five-yard line, the Packers eventually scored on Rodgers' 56-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Lacy. Chicago's next drive again led to zero points, with Cutler being sacked on 4th down by Morgan Burnett. The Packers reclaimed the ball on their 43-yard line, but two plays later, reached the Bears' seven-yard line after Tim Jennings was flagged for pass interference of 53 yards. However, Randall Cobb fumbled after being stripped by Lance Briggs, Ryan Mundy recovering in the endzone. However, the Bears would give the ball back with Cutler being strip-sacked by Julius Peppers at the Bears' 37-yard line. The Packers would extend their lead to 42-0 with Rodgers throwing an 18-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. The Bears ended the first half with a kneel. In the third quarter, the Packers punted for the first time in the game, the ball being returned for no gain at the Bears' 30-yard line, but would be pushed back to the 15-yard line due to Teddy Williams' personal foul penalty. After the Bears went three-and-out, Pat O'Donnell's punt was kicked by Jarrett Boykin and recovered by O'Donnell; the block was officially recorded as a fumble, and as a result, the Bears were considered to have turned the ball on downs. The Packers would score on Mason Crosby's 20-yard field goal. Despite a chance to tie the NFL record for most touchdown passes in a game, Rodgers was pulled for the Packers' third drive of the quarter for Matt Flynn. The Bears scored their first points of the game off Cutler's 45-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. Crosby would kick another field goal, this time a 52-yarder, to make the score 48-7. After both teams exchanged punts, the Bears' drive, which went into the final quarter, reached the Packers' 18-yard line, but Cutler's pass for Matt Forte hit Kyle Long's head, and bounced into Casey Hayward's hands, who scored on the 82-yard return. On the ensuing kickoff, with blocking along the Bears' sideline, Chris Williams scored on the 101-yard return to make the score 55-14. After the Packers punted again, Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler for the Bears' final drive, but was sacked by Sam Barrington on 4th down; the Packers would run out the clock to end the game. The 42 points allowed in the first half was a franchise record, and the six touchdown passes allowed in the half was an NFL record.

The Raiders needed a win and a Miami Dolphins loss or a win and a Denver Broncos loss to clinch a playoff berth. Oakland started well, recovering a muffed fumble by Tyreek Hill on a punt following their first drive and setting them up at the Kansas City 38-yard line. However, the Raiders had to settle for a field goal by Sebastian Janikowsi to take the early 3-0 lead. It would be the last lead the Raiders enjoyed on the night. Oakland's offense could muster little for most of the first half including after the Raider defense stopped KC on a fourth and one at the Oakland 27. The Chiefs took the lead early in the second quarter on a 36-yard pass from Alex Smith to Hill to make the score 7-3. After a four-and-out possession for the Raiders, the Chiefs again went down the field scoring on a Charcandrick West three-yard touchdown run. Following another Raiders short offensive possession, Hill returned a punt 78 yards for a touchdown to extend the Chief lead to 21-3. With six minutes remaining in the half, the Raiders went up-tempo and moved the ball down the field capping the drive with a one-yard touchdown run by Latavius Murray with 14 seconds remaining. At the half, the Raiders trailed 21-10. To begin the second half, the Raider defense stepped up intercepting Smith on the second play of the half and giving the offense the ball at the KC 23. However, the offense was shut down by the KC defense and settled for another Janikowski field goal, bringing them within a touchdown of the Chiefs at 21-13. On the next offensive play for the Chiefs, Khalil Mack sacked and stripped Smith of the ball and the Raiders recovered at the KC 18-yard line. The offense again managed little and was forced to settle for a field goal attempt. However, a bad snap resulted in Marquette King being tackled for three-yard loss. Both offenses mustered very little for the remainder of the game. With seven minutes left in the game, the Raiders needed a touchdown to tie and moved down to the KC 19-yard line, but were stopped on fourth down and the Chiefs ran the clock out.

Carr admitted he had a bad night saying, \"Obviously, we didn't do enough.\" The loss ended the Raiders six-game win streak and gave the Chiefs the lead in the division with a 2-0 record over the Raiders.

Green Bay moved the ball quite effectively the next drive, starting it off with a 26-yard completion to Greg Jennings. The drive ended when Aaron Rodgers was sacked for an 11-yard loss on 3rd down. The Packers settled for a Mason Crosby 36-yard field goal. The Cowboys next drive was fueled by a couple of long runs by RB Marion Barber.

An Aaron Rodgers incomplete pass to WR James Jones on 3rd down set up a 38-yard Mason Crosby field goal. The Cowboys managed to get one first down on the next drive, but were stopped on 3rd down the next drive after Aaron Kampman and Cullen Jenkins teamed up for the sack on Tony Romo. Dallas punted and Green Bay went three and out with a couple of minimal runs by Ryan Grant and an incomplete pass to Greg Jennings forcing the Packers to punt.

The movement for union with Rome led to the initial recognition of a separate Bulgarian Catholic Millet by the Sultan in 1860. The Sultan issued a special decree  for that occasion. Although the movement initially gathered some 60,000 adherents, the subsequent establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate reduced their number with some 75%. The Bulgarian \"Church Struggle\" was resolved finally with a Sultan decree in 1870, which established the Bulgarian Exarchate.  The act also instituted the Bulgarian Orthodox Millet - an entity combining the modern notion for a nation with the Ottoman principle of Millet. It also turned the Bulgarian Exarch into both a religious leader and an administrative head of the Millet. The new entity enjoyed internal cultural and administrative autonomy. However, it excluded non-Orthodox Bulgarians and, thus, failed to embrace all representatives of the Bulgarian ethnos. Scholars argue that the millet system was instrumental to transforming the Bulgarian Exarchate into an entity that promoted ethnoreligious nationalism amongst Orthodox Bulgarians. On 11 May 1872 in the Bulgarian St. Stephen Church in Constantinople, which had been closed by the Ecumenical Patriarch's order, the Bulgarian hierarchs, celebrated a liturgy, whereafter the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Church was declared. The decision on the unilateral declaration of autocephaly by the Bulgarian Church was not accepted by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In this way, the term phyletism was coined at the Holy pan-Orthodox Synod that met in Istanbul on 10 August. The Synod issued an official condemnation of  ecclesiastical nationalism, and declared on 18 September the  Bulgarian Exarchate schismatic.","question":"How many years after the initial recognition of a separate Bulgarian Catholic Millet by the Sultan was the Bulgarian \"Church Struggle\" resolved with a Sultan decree?","answers_spans":{"spans":["10"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_259"}

This name dated back to the peasant uprising that broke out in the Samlot district of Battambang Province in 1967. Under its long-time commander and then Minister of Defense Son Sen, the RAK had 230 battalions in 35 to 40 regiments and in 12 to 14 brigades. The command structure in units was based on three-person committees in which the political commissar ranked higher than the military commander and his deputy. Cambodia was divided into zones and special sectors by the RAK, the boundaries of which changed slightly over the years. Within these areas, the RAK's first task was the peremptory execution of former Khmer National Armed Forces  officers and of their families, without trial or fanfare to eliminate KR enemies. The RAK's next priority was to consolidate into a national army the separate forces that were operating more or less autonomously in the various zones. The Khmer Rouge units were commanded by zonal secretaries who were simultaneously party and military officers, some of whom were said to have manifested \"warlord characteristics\". Troops from one zone frequently were sent to another zone to enforce discipline. These efforts to discipline zonal secretaries and their dissident or ideologically impure cadres gave rise to the purges that were to decimate RAK ranks, to undermine the morale of the victorious army, and to generate the seeds of rebellion.

One of the indicators that clearly illustrates this growth rate is the increase in the number of installed main lines. In 1978 there were only about 850,000 fixed lines installed in Iran. This number rose to about 1,767,000 by 1986 and to about 2,380,000 by 1989. One of the objectives of the first five-year development plan (1989-1994) for the telecommunication sector was to add one million new fixed lines to the network. However, due to the establishment and expansion of many low-capacity and high-capacity exchanges, the actual growth rate that was achieved was considerably higher. In fact more than 3.1 million new main lines were installed during the period of the first five-year plan. Four million new lines were expected to be added by the end of the second five-year plan (1994-1999), which would increase the number of installed main lines to about 9,510,000 fixed lines. Irans telecom market, which generated an estimated $9.1 billion in 2010 (of which 2\/3 from \"voice\" mobile-phone and 1\/10 from \"data\" mobile-phone services), has been growing significantly, especially its mobile-phone business.

The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31-20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14-3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20-7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6-5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver\/cornerback matchups and run with Jeremy Langford, who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, both of which were among the highest in the NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30-39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive. The Chargers won the coin toss and elected to kick off. Despite reaching the Chargers' 28-yard line, two scoring opportunities were denied with Jason Verrett deflecting Jay Cutler's pass for Alshon Jeffery and Robbie Gould's field goal sailing wide left. Afterwards, the Chargers scored with Danny Woodhead's 14-yard touchdown catch from Rivers. On the Bears' next possession, the offense entered Charger territory again, reaching as far as the 10-yard line, where Cutler was sack-stripped by Melvin Ingram, with the ball being recovered by Eric Weddle, though the Chargers failed to capitalize and punted. After the Bears punted as well, they reclaimed the ball when Tracy Porter stripped Dontrelle Inman and linebacker Christian Jones recovered. However, after two plays, Verrett intercepted Cutler's pass for Jeffery, returning it 68 yards for the touchdown; the Chargers eventually missed the extra point, making the score 13-0. On the next drive, Cutler threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Martellus Bennett. After both teams exchanged punts, the Chargers scored the final points of the first half with Josh Lambo's 31-yard field goal. In the second half, after the Chargers punted, Gould's 34-yard field goal attempt hit the left upright. San Diego punted again, and the Bears engineered a 93-yard drive that culminated with Langford scoring on a one-yard run. The Chargers increased the margin to five points with Lambo kicking a 22-yard field goal. Guiding an 80-yard drive, Cutler threw a 25-yard pass to tight end Zach Miller, who caught the pass with one hand as he scored the go-ahead touchdown. Afterwards, Langford scored on the two-point conversion. The Chargers' final drive fell apart with plays like Lamarr Houston's two sacks, and on 4th down and 23, Rivers' deep pass fell incomplete. With 1:09 left in the game, Cutler kneeled three times to end the game. With Cutler's touchdown to Bennett, he overtook Sid Luckman for the most passing touchdowns in franchise history with 138. Additionally, his final touchdown marked his twelfth fourth quarter touchdown, the most in the league. Miller's touchdown catch was his first since the 2011 season.","question":"How many yards was the longest successful field goal?","answers_spans":{"spans":["31"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_295"}

Also, he hoped to take the war to Spain and make territorial gain. The conflict mostly consisted of military action aimed at League members, such as the Battle of Fontaine-Fran\u00e7aise, though the Spanish launched a concerted offensive in 1595, taking Doullens, Cambrai and Le Catelet and in the spring of 1596 capturing Calais by April.

In 1936, a Bugatti Type 22 Brescia Roadster, built 1925, was sunk in the lake by employees of Z\u00fcrich architect Marco Schmucklerski, when Swiss custom officials investigated whether he had paid taxes on the car. The Bugatti was attached to an iron chain making it possible to recover it once the investigation was over, yet that never happened. When the chain corroded, the car sunk to the lake bed, where it was rediscovered on 18 August 1967 by local diver Ugo Pillon and became a favourite target for divers thereafter. When one of the divers, Damiano Tamagni, was killed in a hold-up on 1 February 2008, his friends from the Ascona divers' club decided to lift and sell the carwreck to raise funds for a yet to be created foundation named after the victim. The remains of the Bugatti were recovered on 12 July 2009. The sale took place at the Retro Mobile classic car exhibition in Paris on 23 January 2010. It was sold for \u20ac260,500.","question":"How many years was the Bugatti Roadster at the bottom of the lake?","answers_spans":{"spans":["73"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_317"}

After fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailovi\u0107, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs.

In cases where almost all UN members or sovereign states participate, such as the World Health Organization, the ROC has been completely shut out, while in others, such as the World Trade Organization  and International Olympic Committee  the ROC participates under unusual names: \"Chinese Taipei\" in the case of APEC and the IOC, and the \"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kimmen and Matsu\"  in the case of the WTO. The issue of ROC's name came under scrutiny during the 2006 World Baseball Classic. The organizers of the 16-team tournament intended to call Taiwan as such, but reverted to \"Chinese Taipei\" under pressure from PRC. The ROC protested the decision, claiming that the WBC is not an IOC event, but did not prevail. The ISO 3166 directory of names of countries and territories registers Taiwan  separately from and in addition to the People's Republic of China , but lists Taiwan as \"Taiwan, Province of China\" based on the name used by the UN under PRC pressure. In ISO 3166-2:CN, Taiwan is also coded CN-71 under China, thus making Taiwan part of China in ISO 3166-1 and ISO 3166-2 categories.

The Texans scored first with 5:55 left after Blue caught a pass from Fitzpatrick to lead 7-0. In the second quarter Ben Roethlisberger was sacked by Watt and fumbled the ball near midfield. Houston capitalized on the turnover with a Bullock 39 yard field goal to lead 10-0 with 13:39 left in the 2nd. Houston continued their trend of scoring on each possession with another Bullock field goal (38 yards) to extend their lead to 13-0 with 7:20 left; part of the same drive included the Texans converting on a 4th down and inches. The Steelers finally managed to get on the board with a 44-yard field goal from Shaun Suisham to trail 3-13 with 3:13 left. After forcing a 3 and out for the Texans, the Steelers struck back with a 35-yard touchdown pass from Roerhlisberger to Bryant to trail 10-13 with 1:27 left. After a Houston fumble at their 4-yard line, Pittsburgh took their first lead of the night to lead 17-13 with 1:03 remaining.

The Patriots marched 61 yards in just five plays to take the lead on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Tim Wright. After both teams punted, the Bills lugged 67 yards in just under 5 minutes to tie the game 7-7 on a Kyle Orton touchdown pass to Robert Woods. After a Patriots three-and-out, Orton was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Jones recovering at the Bills 24. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, however, but Gostkowski was successful on a 42-yard field goal try. With 0:06 seconds left in the half, the Bills were attempting to run out the clock, but McCourty stripped C. J. Spiller with Zach Moore recovering at the Bills 42. Brady hit Edelman on a quick 7 yards pass and Gostkowski kicked a 53-yarder for a 13-7 lead at the half. After receiving the opening kickoff of the second half the Patriots reached the Bills 43 in just five plays before Brady launched a bomb to Brian Tyms for a 43-yard touchdown, increasing the New England lead to 20-7. The Bills struck right back with a 13 play, 80-yard drive in just under 7 minutes, culminating in Fred Jackson scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Patriots marched 56 yards on their next possession with Gostkowski adding a 40-yard field goal to increase the lead to 23-14. After a Bills punt Brady led the Patriots down the field and, with just over 6 minutes remaining, found his favorite target, Gronkowski, for a 17-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for an offensive holding penalty on Jordan Devey. This would prove to just be a delay, because Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to LaFell two plays later, capping a 12 play, 80-yard drive. The Patriots now led 30-14 and looked to be well on their way to victory. However, the Bills wouldn't go away quietly. Kyle Orton calmly engineered an 8 play, 80-yard drive, aided by a 35-yard completion on 4th-and-2, that ended in his 8-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan, with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to one possession, 30-22. Starting at the Patriots 7, Brady converted a 3rd-and-16 with a 17-yard completion to Gronkowski, and a few plays later found LaFell on a medium pass, who turned upfield and raced down the sideline for a 56-yard touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 37-22. The Bills reached their own 42 on their final drive, but a sack by Rob Ninkovich and an incomplete pass intended for Scott Chandler on 4th-and-9 officially sealed the deal. Brady completed 27 of 37 passes for 361 yards, with 4 touchdowns and no interceptions. Kyle Orton was equally very impressive, finishing the game  24 of 38 for 299 yards, with 2 TDs and 1 INT. With 4 catches for 97 yards and 2 touchdowns, LaFell continued to be the Patriots awaited deep-threat at wide receiver. Both teams struggled to run the football.

At the time, it was also sometimes called \"the war to end war\" or \"the war to end all wars\" due to its then-unparalleled scale and devastation. In Canada, Maclean's magazine in October 1914 wrote, \"Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War.\" During the interwar period , the war was most often called the World War and the Great War in English-speaking countries. The term \"First World War\" was first used in September 1914 by the German biologist and philosopher Ernst Haeckel, who claimed that \"there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War'\u00a0... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word,\" citing a wire service report in The Indianapolis Star on 20 September 1914. After the onset of the Second World War in 1939, the terms World War I or the First World War became standard, with British and Canadian historians favouring the First World War, and Americans World War I. In the introduction to his book, Waterloo in 100 Objects, historian Gareth Glover states: \"This opening statement will cause some bewilderment to many who have grown up with the appellation of the Great War firmly applied to the 1914-18 First World War.

This fact, along with various other disorders, mutinies and unrest in the country created \"an acute political crisis in the capital.\" By 1921, the ruling Qajar dynasty of Persia had become corrupt and inefficient. The oil-rich nation was somewhat reliant on the nations of Britain and Russia for military and economic support. Civil wars earlier in the decade had threatened the government, and the only regular military force at the time was the Cossack Brigade. The Qajar shah in 1921 was Ahmad, who had been crowned at the age of eleven. He was considered to be a weak, incompetent ruler, especially after British, Russian and Ottoman occupations of Persia during World War I. In 1911, when the capital city, Tehran, had been seized by the Russians, armed Bakhtiaris tribemen, rather than Iranian regular troops, expelled the invaders. This further diminished the government's reputation, rendering it almost powerless in time of war. Britain, which played a major role in Persia, was dismayed by the Qajar government's inability to rule efficiently. This inefficiency was the background of a power struggle between Britain and Russia, each nation hoping to control Persia. On 14 January 1921, the British General Ironside chose to promote Reza Khan, who had been leading the Tabriz battalion, to lead the entire brigade. About a month later, under British direction, Reza Khan's 3,000-4,000 strong detachment of the Cossack Brigade reached Tehran.","question":"Which event happened first, The march on Tehran or the corruption of the Qajar dynasty of Persia?","answers_spans":{"spans":["march on Tehran"],"types":["span"]},"id":"example_426"}

The course of the war saw extensive fighting in Italy, France, and the Low Countries, as well as attempted invasions of Spain and England. The conflict was inconclusive and ruinously expensive for the major participants. The war arose from the failure of the Truce of Nice, which ended the Italian War of 1536-38, to resolve the long-standing conflict between Charles and Francis\u2014particularly their conflicting claims to the Duchy of Milan. Having found a suitable pretext, Francis once again declared war against his perpetual enemy in 1542. Fighting began at once throughout the Low Countries; the following year saw the Franco-Ottoman alliance's attack on Nice, as well as a series of maneuvers in northern Italy which culminated in the bloody Battle of Ceresole. Charles and Henry then proceeded to invade France, but the long sieges of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Saint-Dizier prevented a decisive offensive against the French. Charles came to terms with Francis by the Treaty of Cr\u00e9py in late 1544, but the death of Francis's younger son, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans\u2014whose proposed marriage to a relative of the Emperor was the foundation of the treaty\u2014made it moot less than a year afterwards. Henry, left alone but unwilling to return Boulogne to the French, continued to fight until 1546, when the Treaty of Ardres finally restored peace between France and England.

Moray also raised money in London by selling items from the Scottish crown jewels, including what was claimed to be a unicorn horn. Queen Elizabeth and her advisors were at first reluctant to intervene but their actions, and support of Moray, served to prevent reconciliation in Scotland. The Regent Moray was assassinated in January 1570 by a member of the Hamilton family. Elizabeth sent an army into Scotland in May 1570, which reached Glasgow, where the Queen's party were besieging Glasgow Castle. The army was commanded by the Earl of Sussex from Berwick, its leader in Scotland was William Drury, styled \"Captain General.\" The Earl of Lennox was in their company, arriving at Edinburgh on 14 May 1570. The Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle before the English arrived on 18 May, and returned to their homelands, the Hamiltons to Arran and Craignethan Castle, and Drury attempted a siege of Dumbarton Castle.

Various revolutionary armies carried out the coups. Each was formed by cacos, or peasant militia from the mountains of the north, or who invaded along the porous Dominican border. They were enlisted by rival political factions under the promises of money, which would be paid after a successful revolution, and the opportunity to plunder.

Controlling Tortuga, it had intervened in Haiti  and other Caribbean nations at several times during the previous few decades to exert its influence as a rival power. Germany was increasingly hostile to United States domination of the region under its claimed Monroe Doctrine. In the lead-up to the World War I, the strategic importance of the island of Hispaniola, with its manpower, material wealth, and port facilities, was understood by almost all navies operating in the Caribbean, including Germany and the still-neutral United States. Germany had invested in military and intelligence gathering across Hispaniola as part of a wider network of German interest in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 1890s through the 1910s.

He finds that, after taking into account the cost of living , the standard of living of unskilled workers was about the same in the two cities, while skilled workers had about twice as high a standard of living. The American advantage grew over time from 1890 to 1914, and there was a heavy steady flow of skilled workers from Britain to industrial America.  Shergold revealed that skilled Americans did earn higher wages than the British, yet unskilled workers did not, while Americans worked longer hours, with a greater chance of injury, and had fewer social services. Nationwide from 1890 to 1914 the unionized wages in manufacturing rose from $17.63 a week to $21.37, and the average work week fell from 54.4 to 48.8 hours a week. The pay for all factory workers was $11.94 and $15.84 because unions reached only the more skilled factory workers.","question":"How many total years did the American advantage grow over time?","answers_spans":{"spans":["24"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_455"}

Denmark Vesey began working as an independent carpenter and built up his own business. By this time he had married Beck, an enslaved woman. Their children were born into slavery under the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, by which children of a slave mother took her status. Vesey worked to gain freedom for his family; he tried to buy his wife but her master would not sell her. This meant their future children would also be born into slavery.

In 1818 he was among founders of a congregation on what was known as the \"Bethel circuit\" of the African Methodist Episcopal Church . This had been organized in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1816 as the first independent black denomination in the United States. The AME Church in Charleston was supported by leading white clergy. In 1818 white authorities briefly ordered the church closed, for violating slave code rules that prohibited black congregations from holding worship services after sunset. The church attracted 1848 members, making it the second largest AME church in the nation. City officials always worried about slaves in groups; they closed the church again for a time in 1821, as the City Council warned that its classes were becoming a \"school for slaves\" .

Before the game, Steelers safety Anthony Smith guaranteed a win for the Steelers. After going three-and-out on their first drive, the Patriots fell behind 3-0 early on a 23-yard Jeff Reed field goal to cap an 8-minute, 15-play Steelers possession. A 39-yard Chad Jackson kickoff return gave the Patriots the ball at their own 48-yard line to begin a 9-play drive that ended in a 4-yard Moss touchdown catch to give the Patriots the lead. Moss' touchdown catch was his 18th of the season, surpassing Curtis Martin for the Patriots' record for touchdowns by a single player in a season. After a Steelers three-and-out the Patriots, on their first offensive play of the second quarter, increased their lead to 14-3 on a 63-yard play action pass from Brady to Moss. A 30-yard Willie Parker run on the Steelers' ensuing series set up a 32-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Najeh Davenport. After a Patriots drive in which a muffed punt recovery by Pittsburgh led to a missed 48-yard field goal attempt by Gostkowski, the Steelers mounted a 12-play drive that lasted almost 6&#160;minutes before a 44-yard Reed field goal cut the Patriots' lead to 14-13.

On the Patriots' first drive of the second half, on 1st and 10 from their own 44-yard line, after a Brady lateral pass to Moss fell short, Moss picked it up and threw it back to Brady, who then found Gaffney deep for a 56-yard touchdown.

Brady completed four more passes to set up first-and-goal from the Steelers' 10-yard line, but his next three passes were all incomplete, leading to a 28-yard Gostkowski field goal. The Steelers' next possession, a 13-play drive, ended in another failed fourth down conversion. After a Patriots punt, the Steelers ran the ball three times to give the Patriots their 13th win of the season; with the win, the Patriots improved to 13-0 and also clinched a first-round playoff bye.","question":"How many losses do the Steelers have before the game?","answers_spans":{"spans":["3"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_497"}

Undertaken between June 1840 and November 1841, this revolt was led by Apolinario de la Cruz, otherwise known as \"Hermano Pule\".  De la Cruz started his own religious order, the Confraternity of Saint Joseph  in Lucban, located in the present-day province of Quezon , in June 1840. However, there were two types of priests in the Philippines then: secular priests, or parish priests, which were usually Indio, and religious priests, or convent priests, which were usually Spanish. Due to the concentration of Spanish religious power and authority in the already-established religious orders  and the concept that Filipino priests should only stay in the church and not the convent and vice versa , the Spanish government banned the new order, especially due to its deviation from original Catholic rituals and teachings, such as prayers and rituals suited for Filipinos.However, thousands of people in Tayabas, Batangas, Laguna and even Manila already joined. Because of this, the Spanish government sent in troops to forcibly break up the order, forcing De la Cruz and his followers to rise in armed revolt in self-defense. Many bloody battles were fought with the order's last stand in Mount San Cristobal, near Mount Banahaw, in October 1841. The Spaniards eventually won, and Apolinario de la Cruz was executed on November 4, 1841 in the then-provincial capital, Tayabas.","question":"How many years did the Pule Revolt last?","answers_spans":{"spans":["1"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_534"}

In 48 games, the Redskins led the series 24-23-1 and had won the last five meetings. The Chicago offense took on a Washington defense that excelled against passers, being ranked tenth in the category; Dashon Goldson led all defensive backs in tackles with 95, while Bashaud Breeland led the team in passes defended with 13. The Redskins defensive rush, which had 20 sacks in 2015, was led by Ryan Kerrigan, who has 6.5. Despite such performances, the Redskins rush defense was ranked 29th in yards per carry with 4.64 and 25th in average rushing yards at 124.2. Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears could exploit this with the three-man rushing attack of Matt Forte, Jeremy Langford, and Ka'Deem Carey. On defense, the Bears faced a Kirk Cousins-led offense that focuses on quick passes; Cousins completed a league-high 68.6 percent of his passes, with 7.1 yards per pass. One of Cousins' main targets was tight end Jordan Reed, who scored six touchdowns and led the Redskins in yards after the catch. Rankings-wise, the pass attack was ranked 17th in the league in passing yards per game and 16th for yards per play. Joniak states that the Bears had to force turnovers, and an area was on third down, as five of Cousins' interceptions had been on third down. The Bears won the coin toss and elected to defer. Washington recorded a 15-play, 80-yard drive en route to scoring on Alfred Morris' one-yard touchdown run. After the Bears punted, the Redskins scored again with Cousins' fake read option leading to a three-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Chicago's woes continued when the offense began the next drive on their own seven-yard line, and despite reaching the Washington 49, Jay Cutler was strip-sacked by Trent Murphy, who recovered the fumble. The Redskins failed to capitalize on the turnover and punted; the following two drives also ended with punts. With 52 seconds left in the first half, the Bears took over at their own 42, and managed to score with 18 seconds left when Cutler threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. Cousins kneeled once to end the half. After the Bears punted on the first drive of the second half, Cousins threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Reed. The Bears responded with Cutler's nine-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller, who managed to escape DeAngelo Hall and made contact with Goldson as he reached the endzone.

On the opening kickoff, Patriots linebacker Vince Redd forced a fumble of Carey Davis at the Steelers' 20-yard line that Davis eventually recovered; an unnecessary roughness penalty by the Steelers' Keyaron Fox meant the Steelers would begin their first drive from their own 10-yard line. Four plays in, Vrabel intercepted Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and returned it 5 yards to give the Patriots the ball at the Steelers' 14-yard line. After a Welker reception moved the ball to the Steelers' 2-yard line, Morris ran in for a 2-yard touchdown to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. The Steelers' ensuing possession went three-and-out, but a holding penalty by Aiken on the punt moved the Patriots back to the Steelers' 20-yard line. A 27-yard Moss catch on the next play would help the Patriots reach midfield, but a third-down sack of Cassel set up a Patriots punt, which was returned by the Steelers' Santonio Holmes for 29 yards. Following a 21-yard reception by tight end Heath Miller to begin the drive, the Steelers moved further into Patriots territory on two Nate Washington catches of 15 and 16 yards, both on third down. The Steelers then failed to score from the Patriots' 2-yard line on third down, setting up a 20-yard Jeff Reed field goal to cut the Patriots' lead to 7-3. Three plays into the Patriots' next drive, Moss dropped a pass after he beat his defender inside the Steelers' 35-yard line, eventually setting up another Patriots punt on the final play of the quarter. An exchange of three three-and-outs began the second quarter, leading to Patriots drive that began from their own 40-yard line. A fourth down conversion put the Patriots in the Steelers' red zone, but the Patriots were unable to reach the end zone and settled for a 29-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended their lead to 10-3. Following a 31-yard Gary Russell kick return that gave the Steelers the ball at their own 37-yard line, the Steelers moved 63 yards on 9 plays, capping their drive with a 19-yard Holmes touchdown catch to tie the game at 10 with just under two minutes left in the half. Two plays later, the Patriots found themselves in Steelers' territory again following a 41-yard Faulk run; 35 seconds remained in the first half by the time the Patriots reached the Steelers' 9-yard line on a first down. The Patriots' next three plays would be Cassel pass attempts to Moss; the second of which was dropped by a leaping Moss in the back of the end zone. On fourth down, Gostkowski's 27-yard field goal attempt was no good to keep the game tied at 10 going into halftime. Following a 23-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Steelers cornerback Ike Taylor to begin the second half, the Patriots moved into Steelers' territory, but another sack of Cassel forced a Patriots punt. Starting from their own 14-yard line, the Steelers responded by embarking on a 14-play, 79-drive that reached the Patriots' 7-yard line on a second down but no further; a 25-yard Reed field goal gave the Steelers their first lead of the game, 13-10. With Hobbs, the usual kick returner, on the sidelines vomiting and suffering from cramps, Slater took the ensuing kickoff; the rookie muffed the catch and the fumble was recovered by Fox at the Patriots' 8-yard line. Two plays later, Roethlisberger hit wide receiver Hines Ward for an 11-yard touchdown reception to extend the Steelers' lead to 20-10. Faulk stepped in as kick returner for the next kickoff, which he returned to the Patriots' 29-yard line. However, on the next play, Cassel was strip-sacked by Steelers linebacker James Harrison; the fumble was recovered by linebacker LaMarr Woodley at the Patriots' 26-yard line. Despite a 19-yard Miller catch to begin the Steelers' possession, the Patriots forced the Steelers to kick a field goal; Reed's 20-yard kick gave the Steelers a 23-10 lead. Hobbs came back to return the next kickoff, which began the Patriots' drive from their own 35-yard line. Three plays in, Welker was hit from behind by Steelers safety Ryan Clark after a Cassel pass attempt was tipped; Clark was called for a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty to move the Patriots in Steelers' territory. On 3rd-and-11 from the Steelers' 48-yard line, Cassel was again strip-sacked by Harrison; this time linebacker James Farrior recovered the fumble at the Patriots' 47-yard line. The Steelers next drive began on the final play of the third quarter and reached as far as the Patriots' 22-yard line, where Reed missed a 40-yard field goal to give the Patriots the ball back at their own 30-yard line. The Patriots proceeded to move into Steelers' territory, but on 3rd-and-13 from the Steelers' 43-yard line, a Cassel pass intended for Watson was intercepted by safety Troy Polamalu at the Steelers' 11-yard line and returned for 23 yards in the Patriots' fourth turnover of the second half. Three plays later, a 31-yard Willie Parker moved the Steelers to the Patriots' 28-yard line; they would get as far as the Patriots' 22-yard line before Reed kicked a 45-yard field goal to extend the Steelers' lead to 26-10. With less than six minutes remaining in the game, the Patriots began their next series from their own 44-yard line after Reed's kick was returned from the Patriots' 30-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Cassel found Gaffney open inside the Steelers' 25-yard line, but the wide receiver dropped the pass; Taylor threw the ball back toward Gaffney after the play, drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty that moved the Patriots into Steelers' territory. Seven plays later, on a first down from the Steelers' 14-yard line, Cassel was intercepted by linebacker Lawrence Timmons, who returned it 89 yards before being tackled at the Patriots' 1-yard line by Watson. Two plays later, Russell ran in for a 1-yard touchdown that gave the Steelers a 33-10 lead with less than three minutes to go in the game.

After futile sieges of the defences of Calenberg and Hildesheim by troops from Hildesheim or Brunswick as well as numerous trails of devastation and plundering by both sides against the civilian population, the two sides finally met on 28 June 1519 at the Battle of Soltau . The Hildesheim army scored an emphatic victory against the Brunswick-Welf troops, killing some 3,500 men and capturing one of their leaders, Eric of Calenberg, as well as many of the nobles. This signalled the end of the opening phase of the war. However, an appeal to the newly elected emperor, Charles V, who had a good relationship with Wolfenb\u00fcttel, saw the situation entirely reversed at a political level. The ruling imposed by Charles V provided for the surrender of all conquered territory and release of all the prisoners, and thus ruled very much against the Hildesheim side. Because it was ignored by the bishop and his allies, the emperor's decision was followed in 1522 by the imposition of an imperial ban, the execution of which was assigned to the princes of Wolfenb\u00fcttel and Calenberg. Whilst Henry of L\u00fcneburg had already gone into exile in France in 1520 having transferred the reins of power to his sons and in doing so keeping the Principality of L\u00fcneburg out of the subsequent conflict, there were renewed military clashes between the Hildesheim prince-bishop and his opponents that were not finally resolved  until the so-called 'field peace'  of 15 October 1521.

It has been divided into several current cities and towns, including Nashua, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack. The town was originally part of a larger town of Dunstable, Massachusetts, when Massachusetts stretched from Rhode Island up to Maine. The original tract of land was bisected by the Merrimack River, an important route for the lucrative fur and log trade. Dunstable was incorporated as a township in 1673. On July 3, 1706, during Queen Anne's War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing nine while seven of the natives were killed. When the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border was surveyed and adjusted in 1741, the northern part of the town was determined to be in New Hampshire, and was incorporated as a New Hampshire town in 1746. Both the northern New Hampshire half and the southern Massachusetts half prospered, and various villages were formed along the Merrimack, but also along Salmon Brook, the Nashua River, Pennichuck Brook, and the Souhegan River, which also ran through the tract. Over the years, other towns were formed from parts of the original area on both sides of the state line, and in 1836 the remaining part that still bore the name of \"Dunstable, New Hampshire\" was renamed \"Nashua\", after the name of the river that flowed into the Merrimack at the location then referred to as \"Indian Head\". Six years later Nashua split into \"Nashville\" and \"Nashua\", but in 1853 they rejoined and became the \"City of Nashua\".

The Muslims were no longer given their rights provided by the Treaty of Granada, and were given the choice of:  remain and accept baptism,  reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or  be exiled. Given the expensive fee exacted for passage out of Spain, conversion was the only realistic option for them. Therefore, only a decade after the fall of the Emirate of Granada, the entire Muslim population of Granada had nominally become Christian. A proclamation in 1502 extended these forced conversions to the rest of the lands of Castile, even though those outside Granada had nothing to do with the rebellion. The newly converted Muslims were known as nuevos cristianos  or moriscos . Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies. Many secretly practiced Islam, even as they publicly professed and practiced Christianity. In return, the Catholic rulers adopted increasingly intolerant and harsh policies in order to eradicate these characteristics. This culminated in Philip II's Pragmatica of 1 January 1567 which ordered the Moriscos to abandon their customs, clothing and language.

The Patriots re-signed last season's star LeGarrette Blount who had been released by the Steelers earlier that week after leaving a game early. On the opening possession of the game Matthew Stafford hit Golden Tate for gains of 24 and 17 yards en route to the Patriots 34, but could only settle for a Matt Prater 48-yard field goal. Later, midway through the first quarter, the Patriots raced 64 yards in 9 plays scoring on Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright. The Lions replied on their very next possession, driving 78 yards to the Patriots 2-yard line, but the Patriots and their elite red zone defense did their thing and Prater added a 20-yard field goal. It was all Patriots for the rest of the half. Danny Amendola returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards to the Detroit 22. A 16-yard pass to LaFell and a 3-yard encroachment penalty to Ndamukong Suh moved the ball to the 3-yard line. On the very next play Blount added a 3-yard rushing touchdown, increasing the lead to 14-6. The Lions were able to drive to the Patriots 39, but were forced to punt. Taking over at their own 7, the Patriots methodically moved 93 yards in 13 plays, culminating with Brady find Wright again, for an 8-yard touchdown pass, increasing their lead to 21-6. The Lions drove to the Patriots 35 on the ensuing possession, but Prater missed a 53-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 43, the Patriots needed just four plays to reach the Lions 17 and Gostkowski closed out the half with a 35-yard field goal as they went into the locker room up 24-6. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the half 70 yards down to the Lions 10-yard line trying to bury Detroit, but on 1st down Tom Brady was intercepted by James Ihedigbo. Like almost every possession on the day, the Lions did nothing and punted after five plays. The Patriots proceeded to march 50 yards to the Lions 25 and Gostkowski added a 43-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 27-6. After both teams swapped three-and-outs the Lions advanced to the Patriots 31, but once again settled for a Matt Prater field goal, making the score 27-9 early in the fourth quarter. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Lions reached the Patriots 25, but turned the ball over on downs after Stafford slid short 1-yard short of the first down on 4th-and-10. After making the Patriots punt, Stafford was intercepted by Logan Ryan. Starting at their own 34, the Patriots marched 66 yards in 9 plays, with LeGarrette Blount finished off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. The Lions looked liked a team that was mentally unprepared and lackluster early on with their offense struggling to score in the red zone and made horrific mistakes. At the end of the game, controversy brewed when a defensive lineman slapped the head of Patriots long snapper Danny Aiken, who ended up missing the Chargers game with a concussion, in the head that led to a personal foul penalty and a first down. The Patriots promptly scored on the next play with a 3-yard Blount touchdown, which angered Lions center Dominic Raiola. Raiola later took out his frustration on Patriots defensive lineman Zach Moore by punching him in the back of the helmet. Tom Brady was 38 of 53 for 349 yards 2 TDs (both to Tim Wright) and 1 INTs. LeGarrette Blount added 78 yard on 12 carries and two TDs in his return. Matthew Stafford struggled going only 18 of 46 for 264 yards 0 TDs and 1 INTs. Joique Bell added only 48 yards on 19 carries. Another reason the Lions couldn't get going, Darrelle Revis locked down vaunted receiver Calvin Johson holding him to just 4 catches for 58 yards and 0 TDs.

Along with other networks, CBS chafed at the breaking news embargo imposed upon radio by the wire services, which prevented them from using bulletins until they first appeared in print. CBS disregarded an embargo when it broke the story of the Lindbergh kidnapping in 1932, using live on-the-air reporting. Radio networks scooped print outlets with news of the 1932 presidential election.:485-486 In March 1933, White was named vice president and general manager in charge of news at CBS. As the first head of CBS News, he began to build an organization that soon established a legendary reputation.:486 In 1935, White hired Edward R. Murrow, and sent him to London in 1937 to run CBS Radio's European operation.:486 White led a staff that would come to include Charles Collingwood, William L. Shirer, Eric Sevareid, Bill Downs, John Charles Daly, Joseph C. Harsch:501 Cecil Brown, Elmer Davis, Quincy Howe, H. V.

After Charles' abdication in 1556 split the Habsburg empire between Philip II of Spain and Ferdinand I, the focus of the war shifted to Flanders, where Philip, in conjunction with Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy, defeated the French at St. Quentin. England's entry into the war later that year led to the French capture of Calais, and French armies plundered Spanish possessions in the Low Countries. Nonetheless, Henry was forced to accept a peace agreement in which he renounced any further claims to Italy. The wars ended for other reasons, including the Double Default of 1557, when the Spanish Empire, followed quickly by the French, defaulted on its debts.

The Raiders received the opening kickoff and immediately scored on their first possession by means of a 48-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. Up 3-0, the Oakland defense took the field and was unable to stop the Seahawks from responding. Seattle took advantage of the multiple flags against the defense as Marshawn Lynch and Russell Wilson facilitated a 72-yard drive to score the game's first touchdown on a 3 yard run by Lynch. Both teams went 3-and-out on their next offensive possession before Derek Carr was picked off by Seahawks LB Bruce Irvin who returned it 35 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Carr was intercepted again, this time by Richard Sherman. Seahawks kicker Steven Hauschka added a field goal to put the Seahawks up 17-3. Meanwhile, the Raiders were unable to stop turning the ball over. After Hauschka's field goal, on the ensuing kickoff, T.J. Carrie's return was fumbled at the Oakland 25 and recovered by Hauschka himself at the 31 yard line. Though the Seahawks were unable to turn it into any points on Hauschka's missed field goal, Lynch picked up his second rushing touchdown of the day later in the quarter, this time from 5 yards out, and the Seahawks led 24-3 at halftime. To start the second half, however, the Raiders scored in less than a minute by blocking Jon Ryan's punt and recovering it in the end zone for a touchdown.

It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from Abydos to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in the south.

Memphis in the Early Bronze Age was the largest city of the time.The Old Kingdom of the regional Bronze Age is the name given to the period in the 3rd millennium BC when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization in complexity and achievement - the first of three \"Kingdom\" periods, which mark the high points of civilization in the lower Nile Valley .

The First Intermediate Period was a dynamic time when the rule of Egypt was roughly divided between two competing power bases: Heracleopolis in Lower Egypt and Thebes in Upper Egypt.

The prince's illness was debilitating, and he died on 8 June 1376. Edward III died the following year on 21 June 1377; he was succeeded by the Black Prince's second son Richard II , who was still a child. The treaty at Br\u00e9tigny left Edward III and England with enlarged holdings in France; however, a small professional French army under the leadership of du Guesclin pushed the English back and, by the time of Charles V's death in 1380, the English only held Calais and a few other coastal cities. It was usual to appoint a regent in the case of a child monarch, but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised the power of kingship from the date of his accession in 1377. However, between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in the hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, although Gaunt remained highly influential. Richard faced many challenges during his reign, including the Peasants' Revolt led by Wat Tyler in 1381 and an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384-1385. His attempts to raise taxes to pay for his Scottish adventure and for the protection of Calais against the French made him increasingly unpopular.","question":"How many years after returning to England did the Black Prince die?","answers_spans":{"spans":["5"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_654"}

He was joined by a force of 200 men under Ahmed al Khalifa. Additionally, Bahrain's ally Abu Dhabi sent 2,000 troops in 70 boats. The attack on Qatar led to the sacking of Bida  and Wakra. A British record later stated \"that the towns of Doha and Wakrah were, at the end of 1867 temporarily blotted out of existence, the houses being dismantled and the inhabitants deported\".

Seattle failed again to produce a score during the two minutes left in the third quarter. Dallas had the ball in possession once the fourth quarter began.

Despite Choice's help, Dallas had to score a field goal to complete the 6-minute drive. Trailing 34-9, the Seahawks still aimed to score a touchdown. Their effort was cut short when Cowboys cornerback Terrence Newman compiled an interception at the Dallas 2 on the Seahawks' third play of the drive.

Following a Cardinals' punt on the first possession of the game, the Patriots took their first possession of the season for a touchdown. Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo completed 4\/5 passes for 75-yards on a 10 play drive, ending with his 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chris Hogan. On the Cardinals' next drive, aided by a 39-yard completion from quarterback Carson Palmer to wide receiver John Brown, the Cardinals reached Patriots territory, but were forced to punt. Starting from their own 8-yard line, the Patriots cashed in again. Despite only reaching the Cardinals' 29-yard line, placekicker Stephen Gostkowski nailed a 47-yard field goal for a 10-0 Patriot lead. The Cardinals drove to the Patriots' 31, but on 3rd-and-2, Palmer was sacked for an 8-yard loss. Rather than attempt a 57-yard field goal, the Cards punted. This time the Cards caught a break; on 2nd-and-8, Garoppolo was sacked by linebacker Markus Golden and fumbled with ex-Patriot Chandler Jones recovering at the Patriots' 39, but a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty sent the Cardinals to their own 46. The field position didn't hurt Arizona as they drove 54-yards in 11 plays, scoring on Palmer's 1-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald trimming the deficit to 10-7. Neither team got a first down for the rest of the half. The Patriots kicked off the second-half by storming 75 yards in 9 plays, with Garoppolo converting a 3rd-and-6 with a 10-yard run and a 3rd-and-7 with a 28-yard completion to wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell, before running back LeGarrette Blount finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run, extending the lead to 17-7. The Cardinals punted on their next drive, but on the first play of the Patriots next drive, Blount fumbled with defensive end Calais Campbell recovering for Arizona at the Patriots' 33. With the good field position, Arizona marched 33-yards in just five plays and running back David Johnson scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, trimming the score to 17-14. The Patriots countered with a 50-yard drive to the Cardinals 25. On 3rd-and-4, Garoppolo hit wide receiver Julian Edelman for a first down, but the play was nullified for a holding penalty on tight end Martellus Bennett and the Patriots settled for 53-yard field goal two plays later. Andre Ellington returned the ensuing kickoff 16 yards to the Cardinals 16. This sparked a 79-yard, 7 play drive, aided by a 45-yard run by Johnson, with Palmer finding Fitzgerald on another 1-yard touchdown pass, giving the Cardinals their first lead 21-20. However, Garoppolo came through again. Marching 61 yards, Garoppolo converted a 3rd-and-15 with a 32-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Amendola for a first down. On 3rd-and-3 later, he completed a 7-yard pass to running back James White, and Blount later made up for his fumble with a 13-yard run on 3rd-and-11 and the Patriots ultimately settled for a 32-yard Gostkowski field goal with 3:44 remaining to retake the lead, 23-21. Starting at their own 8, the Cardinals reached the Patriots 33 where two costly mistakes occurred; first, offensive guard Earl Watford was flagged for holding, moving the ball back to the 43. On the very next play, Palmer attempted a screen pass to Andre Ellington, for a four-yard loss, but on 3rd-and-23 at the Patriots 47, Palmer threw a clutch 18-yard pass to Brown to the Patriots 29-yard line setting up a game-winning field goal attempt from placekicker Chandler Catanzaro, but he missed the 47-yard field goal wide left with 36 seconds left.

Knopf books conclude with an unnumbered page titled \"A Note on the Type\", which describes the history of the typeface used for the book. In addition, Knopf books date the year of the book's current printing on the title page. Knopf published textbooks until 1988, when Random House's schools and colleges division was sold to McGraw-Hill. In 1991, Knopf revived the \"Everyman's Library\" series, originally published in England in the early 20th century. This series consists of classics of world literature in affordable hardcover editions. The series has grown over the years to include lines of Children's Classics and Pocket Poets.

He also put into effect a national school system that was largely secular to combat church influence in late 1924. After two years the church protested the movement by refusing to give the blessed sacrament to the populace. Some peasants also joined in the protests, adding greater land reforms to the list of demands by the rebelling priests. The rebellion was openly supported by the Catholic Church and received funding, beginning the Cristero War. Meanwhile, in 1927, another military coup was attempted, this time receiving support from land owners. Calles quickly crushed the rebellion with help from the newly mobilized peasant battalions, who later on were used to fight against the Church. In the midst of the mobilized worker's militias, land reform, and anti-church actions, the American government began to openly declare Mexico a Bolshevik regime. To recover from the backlash, Calles began to tone down the radical rhetoric and slowed land reform policies in 1928. A year later, Calles defeated the church ending the rebellion. After the war ended in 1929, supporters of Calles and Obreg\u00f3n began to form a united political party called the National Revolutionary Party or PNR. This was to unite the various revolutionary factions of the civil war to prevent further Cristero revolts and build stability. After a series of interim presidents controlled by the party, L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas took power in 1934. C\u00e1rdenas was a socialist and began to base government policy on class struggle and empowering the masses. However, not all of his reforms were completely socialist, making him somewhat more centrist than purely socialist. Regardless, his rule was the most radical phase of the post revolution, social revolution.","question":"Which happened first, the Cristero War, or the nationalization of farmland in Mexico?","answers_spans":{"spans":["Cristero War"],"types":["span"]},"id":"example_706"}

While the Bears won the most recent meeting in 2013 21-13, the Bengals dominated the last game in Cincinnati, a 45-10 victory in 2009. As the Bengals defense was struggling to contain opposing running attacks, allowing 170 carries of at least four yards, the most in the NFL, while the Bears had 141 of such attempts (15th in the league), Jeff Joniak wrote the Bears should effectively utilize Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen, while also reducing the number of negative runs (with 50 entering week fourteen). On defense, the Bears had to play without players like  Pernell McPhee, Leonard Floyd, Eddie Goldman, Willie Young, Mitch Unrein, Jerrell Freeman, Adrian Amos, and Quintin Demps, all of whom were sidelined due to injuries. Joniak took note of Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton's struggles under pressure, being sacked 19 times on third down in 2017, while the Bears led the league in third-down sacks with 17 sacks, including at least one sack in every game in 2017. As a result, Joniak stressed the importance of providing a heavy blitz. Joniak also added taking advantage of a Bengals special teams unit that was ranked 27th in average return yards allowed with 10.7, including four 20+-yard returns and a return touchdown. After a physical game against the Steelers in week thirteen, Joniak expressed the possibility of the Bengals being \"flat\", and \"f so, the Bears should pounce on the opportunity and prove they are still playing for pride and the future.\" After the Bengals punted on their first drive, the Bears scored on their opening series for the first time in 2017, doing so on Howard's 21-yard touchdown run. However, Mike Nugent, who was signed earlier in the week to replace an injured Cairo Santos, missed the extra point as the kick hit the right upright. The Bengals responded late in the first quarter when Dalton threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Brandon LaFell, who evaded Deon Bush for the score. Early in the second quarter, Mitchell Trubisky threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Cohen, but it was nullified by Tom Compton's holding penalty; the Bears were eventually forced to settle for Nugent's 34-yard field goal to retake the lead. Nugent added a 27-yard field goal with 2:15 remaining in the half to give the Bears the 12-7 lead at halftime. Following punts on the first two drives of the second half, Trubisky scored on a four-yard touchdown run. On the ensuing drive, Dalton's pass to A. J. Green was deflected and intercepted by Eddie Jackson, which resulted in Trubisky's one-yard touchdown pass to Adam Shaheen. Jackson forced another takeaway when he pulled the ball away from Green's hands and recovered; Chicago once again capitalized via Howard's eight-yard touchdown run to put the Bears up 33-7. Neither team was able to score for the rest of the game. The 26-point victory marked the largest blowout for the Bears since a 51-20 win over the Tennessee Titans in 2012. It was also Chicago's highest-scoring game since the team scored 37 against the St. Louis Rams in 2015. The Bears offense ended the game with a season-high 482 total yards, nearly 200 more than in the Bears' last two games, along with 232 rushing yards and three touchdowns on the ground. Howard recorded 167 rushing yards, resulting in a season total of 1,032, and he became the first running back in Bears history to have 1,000-yard rushing seasons in his first two years in the NFL.","question":"How many points did the Bengals win the last game that was hosted in Cincinnati by?","answers_spans":{"spans":["35"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_767"}

Dallas would answer in their first possession with QB Tony Romo completing a 72-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Philadelphia replied with Akers kicking a 44-yard field goal, yet the 'Boys immediately added to their lead with rookie RB Felix Jones returning a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles would take the lead with QB Donovan McNabb completing a 6-yard TD pass to RB Brian Westbrook, along with LB Chris Gocong recovering a Romo fumble in the Cowboys' endzone for a touchdown.  Dallas immediately responded with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again on a 4-yard TD pass. On Philadelphia's next drive, the referees made two suspect decisions. The first was a non-call on a very obvious facemask on Brian Westbrook that would have given the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40-yard passing interference penalty on Anthony Henry. Replays showed that it was Greg Lewis who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1-yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal.

The previous meeting between the two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30-13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3-4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns in the first five games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's Kentucky bluegrass could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0-4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered \"may be the only thing slowing down the Saints.\" After the Bears punted, Garrett Hartley kicked a 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan recovered the loose ball and reached the Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, Hartley kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after Hartley kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed Hartley to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26-10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Fort&#233;'s two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26-18 win. The win marked the first time the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois. Jeffery broke the franchise record for most receiving yards in franchise history with 218, which surpassed Harlon Hill's 214 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in 1954.

The name was possibly given after a local landmark\u2014Akmola literally means \"a white grave\" in Kazakh language\u2014although this theory is not universally accepted. In 1832, the settlement was granted town status and named Akmolinsk. The fairly advantageous position of the town was clear as early as 1863 in an abstract from the Geographic and Statistical Dictionary of the Russian Empire. It describes how picket roads and lines connected this geographic centre to Kargaly in the East, Aktau fort in the South and through Atbasar to Kokshetau in the West. In 1838, at the height of the great national and liberation movement headed by Kenesary Khan, Akmolinsk fortress was burned. After the repression of the liberation movement, the fortress was rebuilt. On 16 July 1863, Akmolinsk was officially declared an uyezd town. During the rapid development of the Russian capitalist market, the huge Saryarka \u2014 Steppe and Lakes of Northern Kazakhstan were actively exploited by the colonial administration. To draft regulation governing the Kazakh Steppe the Government of the Russian Empire formed Steppe Commission in 1865. On 21 October 1868, Tsar Alexander II of Russia signed a draft Regulation on governing Turgay Oblast (Russian Empire), Ural Oblast (Russian Empire), Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire) and Semipalatinsk Oblast, Russias. In 1869, Akmolinsk external district and department were cancelled, and Akmolinsk became the centre of the newly established Akmolinsk Oblast (Russian Empire). In 1879, Major General Dubelt proposed to build a railway between Tyumen and Akmolinsk to the Ministry of Communications of Russia.

The game tied at 27-27 and went into overtime where Houston kicker Neil Rackers made a 37-yard FG, ending the match at 30-27. After this, the Redskins lost to St. Louis 30-16 before McNabbs return to Philadelphia. Although Washington did not deliver a particularly strong performance, they won 16-12 after Eagles QB Michael Vick was injured and replaced by Kevin Kolb. In Week 5, they hosted Green Bay for only the second time since 1979 (the first was in 2004) and beat them 16-13. After losing a Sunday Night match to the Colts, Washington beat Chicago in Week 7. Although McNabb threw two interceptions, the team took advantage of their opponents porous O-line to sack and pick off Jay Cutler (American football) four times, winning 17-14. After losing a 37-25 trap game in Detroit, the Redskins went on their bye week and returned to host Philadelphia on MNF for the second straight year. As rain fell on Fedex Field, the Eagles proceeded to crush Washington 59-28 with eight touchdowns. In contrast to the huge numbers put up by Michael Vick, McNabb looked decidedly unimpressive, with two touchdown passes and three interceptions (one returned for a TD). Just before the game, he had finalized his contract with the Redskins, who gave him a 5-year, $78 million deal and allowing him to (barring unforeseen circumstances) finish out his career in Washington. After beating Tennessee, the Redskins lost four straight games and were removed from playoff contention before beating Jacksonville in Week 16. After losing to New York at home, the Redskins finished the year at 6-10 and once again 4th place in the division.","question":"Against which teams did Washington score 16 points?","answers_spans":{"spans":["Eagles","Green Bay"],"types":["span","span"]},"id":"example_799"}

A similar attempt to block the harbour entrance during the night of 3-4 May also failed. In March, the charismatic Vice Admiral Makarov had taken command of the First Russian Pacific Squadron with the intention of breaking out of the Port Arthur blockade. On 12 April 1904, two Russian pre-dreadnought battleships, the flagship Petropavlovsk and the Pobeda, slipped out of port but struck Japanese mines off Port Arthur. The Petropavlovsk sank almost immediately, while the Pobeda had to be towed back to port for extensive repairs. Admiral Makarov, the single most effective Russian naval strategist of the war, perished on the battleship Petropavlovsk. On 15 April 1904, the Russian government made overtures threatening to seize the British war correspondents who were taking the ship Haimun into warzones to report for the London-based Times newspaper, citing concerns about the possibility of the British giving away Russian positions to the Japanese fleet. The Russians quickly learned, and soon employed, the Japanese tactic of offensive minelaying.

On September 10, Patriots coach Bill Belichick was accused by the Jets of authorizing his staff to film the Jets' defensive signals from an on-field location, a violation of league rules. The Jets confiscated the video camera used by video assistant Matt Estrella to film the signals during the game and filed a complaint to the league office, detailing the accusations. On September 13, Belichick was officially fined $500,000, while the Patriots were also fined $250,000, and forfeited their first round draft pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. If the Patriots had missed the playoffs, they would have instead forfeited their second and third round selections in the 2008 draft. Goodell said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick is effectively the team's general manager as well as head coach, and exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick, but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run. Belichick later issued a statement in which he apologized for what he called a \"mistake\" in his interpretation of the rules.

Gas was soon used by all major belligerents throughout the war. It is estimated that the use of chemical weapons employed by both sides throughout the war had inflicted 1.3 million casualties. For example, the British had over 180,000 chemical weapons casualties during the war, and up to one-third of American casualties were caused by them. The Russian Army reportedly suffered roughly 500,000 chemical weapon casualties in World War I. The use of chemical weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited their use. The effect of poison gas was not limited to combatants. Civilians were at risk from the gases as winds blew the poison gases through their towns, and they rarely received warnings or alerts of potential danger. In addition to absent warning systems, civilians often did not have access to effective gas masks. An estimated 100,000-260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more  died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended. Many commanders on both sides knew such weapons would cause major harm to civilians but nonetheless continued to use them. British Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig wrote in his diary, \"My officers and I were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront.

After almost a month of intense fightings rebels were trapped and their only choices were either to die fighting, to surrender or to flee to Montenegro. Most of the rebels chose to flee to Montenegro which became a base for large number of rebels determined to attack the Ottoman Empire.

This early form of local government played a role in the development of a political system in the Netherlands that was decentralised and dependent on communal cooperation. Widespread experience with decentralized government was a factor in the formation of the Dutch Republic in the 16th and 17th centuries. The mandate of Rijkswaterstaat , established in 1798 under French rule, was to centralise water control in the Netherlands. Local water boards refused to give up their autonomy however, so Rijkswaterstaat ended up working alongside the local water boards. Today Rijkswaterstaat has responsibility for major water control structures and other infrastructure like motorways. By 1850 there were about 3,500 water boards in the country. In modern times water boards merged as they dealt with joint  interests. Mergers eventually reduced the number to 25 water boards in 2011. The tasks of water boards remain basically unchanged. Having a rich history dating back to the Middle Ages, they are the oldest governing bodies and the oldest democratic institutions in the Netherlands. Dutch water boards have their own coat of arms, a colourful reminder of their importance in Dutch history. The historic buildings that used to house the water boards are another legacy.

The Giants had several opportunities to take command in the second half, but red zone difficulties, similar to those experienced against the Cowboys in week 13, hurt their chances.  Eli Manning hit Plaxico Burress in stride for a big gain to get inside the 10, but were forced to settle for a field goal. After forcing a fumble on the ensuing Eagles possession, the Giants had the ball first and goal from the seven-yard line, but two runs and a pass yielded zero yards and Feely kicked another short field goal, putting the Giants ahead 16-14. The Eagles came right back as Reno Mahe returned the ensuing kick 64 yards for Philadelphia. Westbrook then ran through a gaping hole 28 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles' next drive ended with an interception by Giants cornerback Will Demps. The Giants took advantage on a drive culminating with a Jacobs score from one yard out.  After the score, the Giants went for the two-point conversion, but were denied on a draw play, leaving the score 22-21 with seven minutes remaining. Garcia responded swiftly by driving his squad 80 yards in eight plays; an 18-yard strike to Reggie Brown and a conversion put the Eagles up seven.  Manning was then intercepted on the following drive for an insurance touchdown by Trent Cole, ostensibly putting the game away for Philadelphia. For the game, the Eagles 31st-ranked rush defense held the Giants to 88 net running yards, Manning threw for 282 yards on 28 of 40 passing, Burress recorded 120 receiving yards and Jeremy Shockey had eight receptions for 70 yards. Carlos Emmons and Will Demps recorded the only sacks for the Giants.  For Philadelphia, Jeff Garcia continued his surprising rebirth, completing 19 of 28 passes for 237 yards and one touchdown (along with one interception), and Brian Westbrook gained over 140 total yards while scoring a touchdown.","question":"How many receiving yards did Shockey and Burress have combined?","answers_spans":{"spans":["190"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_860"}

Having already clinched a playoff berth, Tampa Bay rested most of their starters in the second half. Despite a late rally, the Buccaneers fell two points short of victory. Tampa Bay controlled most of the first half, capping off their first two drives of the first quarter with field goals by Matt Bryant. On the first play of the second quarter, Shaun Hill connected with Darrell Jackson on a 21-yard touchdown. San Francisco punted on their next drive, and Micheal Spurlock fielded the ball at the 19-yard line. He was tackled and fumbled, while the 49ers recovered. After an instant replay challenge, it was determined that Spurlock was down by contact, and Tampa Bay maintained possession. The drive fizzled though, and ended with a punt. Late in the fourth quarter, Barrett Ruud recovered a 49ers fumble, setting the Buccaneers up on the San Francisco 36-yard line. Four plays later, Jerramy Stevens caught a touchdown pass from Jeff Garcia. Tampa Bay took a 13-7 lead into halftime. On the second-half kickoff, San Francisco recovered a surprise onside kick. The drive came up empty, as they were forced to punt. On Tampa Bay's next possession, however, Luke McCown (who had taken over for the benched Garcia) fumbled and the 49ers recovered at the 14-yard line. In four plays, San Francisco scored a touchdown. Early in the fourth quarter, Nate Clements intercepted a McCown pass, and led to another 49ers touchdown. The 49ers led 21-13, but Tampa Bay still kept hopes alive for a rally. With less than six minutes left in the game, the Buccaneers drove to the 49ers 25-yard line.

Tampa Bay managed one final chance to tie the score. Inside the two-minute warning, Tampa Bay drove to the 49ers 24-yard line. McCown rolled out wide to his right, and connected with Stevens for a 24-yard touchdown. McCown then attempted a game-tying two-point conversion.

Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli.

The Ravens' defense welcomed him rudely on his first drive with an interception by Ed Reed. The Ravens were able to attain good field position consistently throughout the first half, and quarterback Kyle Boller (who himself was starting in place of an injured starting quarterback, Steve McNair), capitalized with a two-yard touchdown to Willis McGahee late in the first quarter. The teams traded field goals to start the second quarter; Jets kicker Mike Nugent hit a 50-yard field goal, followed by Matt Stover hitting a 28-yard attempt for the Ravens. After Stover missed a 46-yard try, the Jets tried to respond with Nugent attempting a 52-yard field goal, but Nugent missed wide left, his first miss in twenty attempts dating back to last season. Boller once again took advantage of the short field provided and hit tight end Todd Heap on a four-yard touchdown with six seconds left in the half to extend the Ravens' lead to 17-3. Heap's catch was initially ruled incomplete, but the call was subjected to a booth review and reversed, as replays showed he was able to touch both feet within the end zone. After a quiet third quarter, Stover hit a 43-yard field goal to start the fourth quarter, and extended Baltimore's lead to seventeen. Baltimore's defense, which ranked as the best in the NFL in 2006, was able to shut down Clemens and the Jets for most of the game, but Clemens was able to rally the team in the fourth quarter. Using a no huddle offense, Clemens drove the team down to the Baltimore three-yard line, before the Jets settled for a 21-yard field goal. On the Jets' next possession, 44 and 24-yard strikes by Clemens to Jerricho Cotchery got the Jets to the Ravens' goal line, where he found tight end Chris Baker for a three-yard touchdown, cutting the Jets' deficit to seven. Though the Jets failed to convert the ensuing onside kick, poor clock management by Boller gave the Jets the ball back with 2:38 left in the game. Clemens immediately found Cotchery on a 50-yard catch-and-run, later followed by a 24-yard pass to Laveranues Coles that brought the Jets' to the Baltimore seven-yard line with just over a minute to go. Clemens passed to Justin McCareins for a potential touchdown, but the pass was dropped by McCareins. A second pass to McCareins in the end zone deflected off him and into the arms of Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis for the game-ending interception.

It is estimated that the total output of mines and factories in 1921 was 20 percent of the pre-World War I level, with many crucial items suffering an even more drastic decline. Production of cotton, for example, had fallen to 5 percent and iron to 2 percent of the pre-war level, and this coincided with droughts in 1920 and 1921 and the Russian famine of 1921. Discontent grew among the Russian populace, particularly the peasantry, who felt disadvantaged by Communist grain requisitioning . They resisted by refusing to till their land.

In 1763, Great Britain in the Seven Years War led to the growth of the First British Empire. With the defeat by the United States, France and Spain in the War of American Independence, Britain lost its 13 American colonies and rebuilt a Second British Empire based in Asia and Africa.  As a result, culture of the United Kingdom, and its technological, political, constitutional, and linguistic influence, became worldwide.  Politically, the central event was the French Revolution And its Napoleonic aftermath, 1793\u20131815, which British elites saw as a profound threat, and worked energetically to form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. The Tories, who came to power in 1783, remained in power (with a short interruption) until 1830. Forces of reform, often emanating from the Evangelical religious elements, opened decades of political reform that broadened the ballot, and opened the economy to free trade. The outstanding political leaders of the 19th century included Palmerston, Disraeli, Gladstone, and Salisbury.  Culturally the Victorian era (Queen Victoria reigned 1837\u20131901) was a time of prosperity and dominant middle-class virtues when Britain dominated the world economy and maintained a generally peaceful century, 1815\u20131914. The First World War (1914\u20131918), in alliance with France, Russia and the United States, was a furious but ultimately successful total war with Germany. The resulting League of Nations was a favorite project in Interwar Britain. However, while the Empire remained strong, As did the London financial markets, the British industrial base began to slip behind Germany and especially the United States. Sentiments for peace were so strong that the nation supported appeasement of Hitlers Germany in the late 1930s, until the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 opened the World War II. In the World War II 1939\u201345, France, the Soviet Union the U.S. joined Britain as Allies of World War II. Britain and its Empire faced near defeat at several points, 1940\u201342, but finally crushed Germany, Italy and Japan.","question":"How many years did the French Revolution and its Napoleonic aftermath last?","answers_spans":{"spans":["22"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_979"}

After winning the coin toss, the Patriots deferred their pick to the start of the second half; the Broncos elected to receive. On the opening series, Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler injured his finger on the first play, but led the Broncos into Patriots territory, where running back Andre Hall, who replaced injured starter Michael Pittman two plays prior, fumbled at the Patriots' 30-yard line; Patriots defensive lineman Le Kevin Smith's recovery gave the Patriots the ball at their own 32-yard line to begin their first drive. A 29-yard reception by Watson brought the Patriots into the Broncos' red zone, where the drive ended and a 31-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. On the fourth play of the Broncos' ensuing drive, Hall fumbled again; this time, a scramble for the ball pushed it 25 yards in the Patriots' favor to the Broncos' 37-yard line, where Mayo recovered it. A Broncos unnecessary roughness penalty on the play gave the ball to the Patriots at the Broncos' 22-yard line, but after failing to make a first down, a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots' lead to 6-0. An exchange of three punts brought the game into the second quarter, where Morris ran for 34 yards on the second play of a Patriots drive to put them in the Broncos' red zone yet again. Four plays later, on 4th-and-1 from the Broncos' 4-yard line, Morris ran for a 4-yard touchdown that gave the Patriots a 13-0 lead. The Broncos' next drive ended with Meriweather intercepting a deep throw by Cutler, setting up the Patriots' next series at their own 16-yard line. After a sack of Cassel put the Patriots even deeper into their own territory, a facemask penalty on Cassel on third down by Broncos linebacker Jamie Winborn gave the Patriots a new set of downs. Five plays later, on another 4th-and-1, Morris ran for 29 yards to give the Patriots a first down from the Broncos' 13-yard line; he ran for a total of 138 yards on 16 carries. On the next play, Moss caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to extend the Patriots' lead to 20-0. The Broncos' next drive began with backup Patrick Ramsey replacing Cutler at quarterback. On the fourth play, defensive lineman Mike Wright sacked Ramsey and forced a fumble, which undrafted free agent linebacker Gary Guyton caught to give the Patriots the ball at midfield. Cassel suffered his fifth sack on the next play, the final of the first half. The Patriots chose to receive the ball to open the second half. Another undrafted rookie, running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis, elevated from the Patriots' practice squad before the Chargers game, replaced Morris, who left the game with a knee injury. A Patriots punt was followed by a Broncos three-and-out; Welker returned the punt 44 yards to give the Patriots the ball at the Broncos' 28-yard line. After two Green-Ellis carries gained one yard, Cassel used a screen play to throw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Moss to extend the Patriots' lead to 27-0. Three completed passes and an unnecessary roughness penalty on Patriots defensive lineman Vince Wilfork moved the Broncos' next drive into Patriots' territory before the Broncos turned the ball over for the fifth and final time, with safety James Sanders intercepting a Cutler pass; a second unnecessary roughness call, originally on Wilfork but later changed to be on Sanders, gave the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line to begin the ensuing drive. Three plays after a 27-yard Welker catch put the Patriots in Broncos territory, Broncos safety Calvin Lowry appeared to have intercepted an errant Cassel throw at the Broncos' 1-yard line, but, when the Patriots challenged, the pass was deemed incomplete, as the ball touched the ground before Lowry had possession. Two plays later, Welker caught his first touchdown pass of the season, this one from 6 yards out, to give the Patriots a 34-0 lead. Four plays later, former Patriots tight end Daniel Graham caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Cutler to cut the Patriots' lead to 34-7. The Patriots' next drive got as far as the Broncos' 33-yard line but eventually ended in a punt. The Broncos, facing 3rd-and-21 on their next drive, had a 21-yard completion by Cutler pushed back by a Broncos holding penalty; Richard Seymour sacked Cutler on the next play, forcing the Broncos to punt on 4th-and-23 with 6:35 left in the game. On the ensuing Patriots drive, two 10-yard runs by Green-Ellis and 16- and 15-yard runs by Faulk put the Patriots in the red zone, where Green-Ellis earned his first NFL touchdown, running in untouched from the 1-yard line, to score the final points of the game. Another Broncos punt gave the Patriots the ball to end the game with a 41-7 victory that took the Patriots' record to 4-2. The Patriots accumulated 257 rushing yards, their largest total since the 1985 season. Cassel, who completed 18 of 24 passes for 185 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, finished with a passer rating of 136.3, one of the ten highest single-game ratings in Patriots history, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. On the final play of the third quarter, as the Broncos were driving into Patriots territory, Harrison was injured while attempting to tackle Cutler. Harrison, whose 2005 and 2006 seasons were cut short by knee injuries that caused ligament damage, suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in his right leg. Harrison was carted off the field and placed on injured reserve two days later. Safety Antwain Spann was then activated from the practice squad. The Broncos also lost players to injury: Ramsey and linebacker Boss Bailey were also placed on injured reserve, while cornerback Champ Bailey was sidelined for several weeks by a torn groin muscle.","question":"How many points were scored in the first quarter?","answers_spans":{"spans":["6"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_988"}

He added the offense should punctuate the run with deep passes, as the Colts were the most penalized defense in the NFL with six pass interference and three personal fouls, along with just four turnovers forced resulting in only three total points. Meanwhile, the Bears defense had to attack Colts quarterback Andrew Luck; Indianapolis was allowing a league-high 15 sacks, was ranked 29th in pass protection efficiency, the second-most hurries (35) the highest number of knockdowns (33) allowed, along with 10 combined false start and holding penalties.

In the first quarter, Cincinnati threatened to score after Bengals wide receiver AJ Green caught a 43-yard pass from quarterback Andy Dalton. Tight end Jermaine Gresham appeared to catch a 7-yard touchdown pass from Dalton, but it was nullified because of a false start penalty on Green. The Bengals lined up for a field goal, but could not get the kick off in time, causing a delay of game. After the five-yard penalty, the Bengals lined up for the field goal again. But this time, Pittsburgh's Cameron Heyward blocked the field goal, giving the Steelers the ball around the 20-yard line. Pittsburgh could not capitalize however, and punted it away. The rest of the 1st quarter was scoreless. Then in the 2nd quarter, the Steelers began a scoring frenzy. The first of Pittsburgh's 4 touchdowns came when Rashard Mendenhall ran in a score from 3 yards out to give Pittsburgh a 7-0 lead.

Early visitors describe extensive fields cleared for cultivation. The tribe also fished the Kennebec River. French Jesuits established an early mission at the village, which was located at Old Point. But Father Sebastien Rale , appointed missionary in 1694, was suspected of abetting the tribe's raids on English settlements. Governor Joseph Dudley put a price on his head. British troops attacked the village in 1705 and again in 1722, but both times Father Rale escaped into the woods. But on August 23, 1724, during Father Rale's War, soldiers attacked the village unexpectedly, killing 26 warriors and wounding 14, with 150 survivors fleeing to Canada. Among the dead was Father Rale. Settled by English colonists about 1773, the land would be surveyed in 1791. In 1775, Benedict Arnold and his troops would march through Norridgewock Plantation, as it was known, on their way to the ill-fated Battle of Quebec.   The town had originally been settled under the name \"Norridgewock Falls.\" This was later changed to \"Bernardstown,\" after the major land owning family, the Bernards. It was then officially incorporated on March 7, 1804, the town was named after United States president James Madison. Farming was an early industry, with hay and cattle the principal products. The native rock is slate, and a quarry was established to extract it. Because of the region's abundant forests, lumbering developed as an industry, with four sawmills operated by water power on the Kennebec. Here the Norridgewock Falls drop 90 feet  over a mile, which attracted other manufacturers as well. In the 19th century, the small mill town had factories which produced carriages, window sash, window blinds, doors and coffins.","question":"How many more survivors left the village than were wounded?","answers_spans":{"spans":["136"],"types":["number"]},"id":"example_997"}

They drove all the way to the Patriots 5-yard line, but had to settle for a 23-yard field goal by kicker Matt Bryant. The Patriots responded later in the first quarter with a marathon drive of their own taking over 6 minutes off the clock, 12 plays and 76 yards later, third-string running back Brandon Bolden ran for a 3-yard touchdown, but the Falcons challenged and he didn't break the plane of the end zone, moving the ball back to the 1.

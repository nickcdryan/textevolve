# Grid Transformation Task: Accumulated Learnings

This document serves as a detailed research log for the grid transformation task, capturing dataset characteristics, effective/ineffective strategies, common failure modes, and experiment findings.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Grid-based representation:** The dataset uses grids of numbers (integers) to represent colors, states, or patterns. The input and output are matrices. Examples of color palettes are 0-9.
*   **Abstract Rule Application:** The core task involves identifying a hidden, abstract rule or a sequence of transformations. The identified rule must be consistently applicable across *all* training examples and then be applied to a new, unseen test input grid to generate the expected output. The questions are formatted as "Grid Transformation Task" problems and include a description of the task, training examples (input/output grid pairs), and a test input grid. The instructions emphasize identifying a single meta-rule or transformation sequence.
*   **Abstract Transformation Rules:** The underlying challenge lies in deciphering abstract transformation rules that govern how input grids are converted to output grids. These rules can involve spatial relationships, color manipulations, or more complex logical operations.
*   **Varied Transformation Types:** Transformations encompass a wide range of operations:
    *   **Spatial Transformations:** Rotation (e.g., 90-degree clockwise, counter-clockwise), Reflection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), Translation (shifting patterns within the grid).
    *   **Color/Shape Transformations:** Changing colors based on specific rules, filling shapes with different colors.
    *   **Counting/Arithmetic/Boolean Operations:** Applying arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) based on the number of specific colors or shapes. Implementing boolean logic based on cell values and/or locations.
*   **Importance of Context/Location:** The transformations might depend on the location of a cell within the grid. E.g., the top row might be transformed differently from the bottom row.
*   **Limited Color Palette:** The limited color palette (e.g., 0-9) suggests that the rules might involve relationships between these colors (e.g., swapping specific color pairs).
*   **Need for Precise Matching:** The transformations necessitate identifying precise patterns and applying them accurately. Even small errors in applying the rule can lead to incorrect outputs.
*   **Transformation Complexity:** Transformation can involve a single rule or a combination of rules applied sequentially or in parallel. Some rules might depend on the prior application of other rules.
*   **Varied grid dimensions:** The grid sizes vary between questions, adding to the complexity of generalization. Many examples use 10x10 grids.
*   Grids are represented as nested lists of integers, where integers denote colors.
*   The core task is *abstract reasoning and visual pattern recognition.* Common operations include color/shape transformations, spatial transformations (rotation, reflection, translation), and pattern completion.
*   **Limited Examples:** The task presents a limited number of training examples (typically 2-3) to learn the transformation rule. This necessitates robust few-shot learning capabilities.
*   **Structured Prompts:** The questions are highly structured, including a task description, training examples (input/output pairs), and a test input. The prompt explicitly asks for a transformation rule explanation and the output grid.
*   **Color Representation Detail:** Numbers in the grids represent colors, adding a layer of visual pattern recognition to the abstract reasoning. The instructions include a color key.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **None identified:** At this stage, no tested strategies have yielded acceptable accuracy levels on this dataset. The highest accuracy achieved so far is 0.33. The LLM-driven approach with rule generation and scoring did not yield any correct answers in Iteration 7 (accuracy of 0.00) and Iteration 8 (0.00) and iteration 9 (0.00).
*   **Multi-agent approach with specialized roles (rule extraction, verification, application):** It is a reasonable decomposition of the problem, but its success hinges on the accuracy of each agent's performance.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Rule Extraction Inaccuracy/Pattern Inference Failure:** The primary failure mode is the inability to accurately extract the underlying transformation rule from the training examples. The LLM struggles to translate visual patterns into logical rules. "Invalid rule extracted" is a common error.
    *   *Example:* Failing to identify that a specific color is consistently moved to a specific location in the grid across all training examples.
    *   **Incorrect Generalization:** The extracted rule might overgeneralize or misinterpret the relationships between input and output grids, leading to erroneous transformations. For example, the model could not determine which rows to mirror, making the rule invalid.
    *   **Lack of Determinism:** The rule might be ambiguous or incomplete, failing to provide a clear and deterministic procedure for applying the transformation to new input grids.
*   **Spatial Reasoning Limitations:** Weakness in spatial reasoning skills hinders the LLM's comprehension of transformations like rotations, reflections, or translations of patterns within the grid.
    *   *Example:* Inability to identify that the output grid is a 90-degree rotation of a specific section of the input grid.
*   **Inconsistent Rule Application/Rule Application Failure:** Even with partial rule identification, the LLM can apply the rule inconsistently or incorrectly to the test input. This could stem from an inability to generalize the learned rule or to handle edge cases in the grid.
    *   *Example:* Extracting a rule that applies to a specific row or column, but failing to apply it to all relevant rows or columns in the test grid.
*   **Difficulty with Abstract Rules:** The LLM struggles to understand and apply abstract rules that are not directly evident from the pixel-level data.
    *   *Example:* Difficulty recognizing that the output grid represents the "mirror image" of the input grid.
*   **Lack of Generalization:** The LLM struggles to generalize from the training examples to the test input. It can overfit to the specific training instances and fail when faced with slightly different variations in the test data.
*   **Ignoring Edge Cases:** The LLM may fail to account for edge cases or boundary conditions in the grid transformations.
    *   *Example:* Failing to handle the case where a rotation shifts a pixel beyond the bounds of the grid.
*   **Confusing Similar Transformations:** Difficulty distinguishing between similar types of transformations (e.g., confusing a 90-degree rotation with a reflection).
*   **"Thinking Config is not supported" Error:** Intermittent errors related to the `thinking_config` indicate potential issues with the execution environment or API calls. Likely, using the thinking config is not supported by the model being employed in that specific use case. Encountered errors like "400 INVALID_ARGUMENT. {'error': {'code': 400, 'message': 'thinking_config is not supported.', 'status': 'INVALID_ARGUMENT'}}" suggest compatibility problems with the API or framework used.
*   **Indentation Errors in Generated Code:** Automatically generated code can contain indentation errors, indicating a failure in the code generation process. This highlights a problem in the ability of the LLM to properly format Python code (or other languages used for symbolic reasoning), suggesting a need for strict code formatting and validation steps.
    * *Example:* IndentationError: unexpected indent (current_script_4.py, line 2)
*   **Misapplication of rules:** Even if a rule is extracted, the application to the test input often leads to incorrect results. This could stem from errors in spatial reasoning or incorrect coding of the transformation.
*   **Dimensionality issues:** The LLM struggles to handle variations in grid dimensions. For example, the LLM may not extract the patterns or patterns for different sized grids, even if the pattern is similar.
*   **LLM struggles to extract a single consistent rule:** The LLM struggles to extract a single consistent rule across training example pairs.
*   **Formatting Issues:** In some cases, the system provides a confirmation message about formatting readiness instead of attempting to solve the task. This suggests a potential breakdown in the orchestration of the different agents or a premature exit from the reasoning process.
*   **Error Propagation:** If the rule extraction is flawed, the subsequent verification and application stages are rendered ineffective, as they operate on an incorrect premise.
*   **Ambiguity and edge cases:** LLMs struggle to define rules robust enough to handle edge cases or less-obvious applications of the core transformation principle.
*   **Incorrect Rule Application:** The most common failure mode is the inability to accurately translate the inferred abstract transformation rule into concrete changes on the test grid. The logic for applying the rule to specific cells or regions is often flawed, leading to incorrect placement or modification of colored elements (numbers).
*   **Reasoning Errors:** In some cases, the LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation rule from the training examples. This leads to applying completely wrong rules, resulting in a nonsensical output grid.
*   **Lack of Spatial Precision:** Even when the correct transformation rule is identified, the LLM struggles with precise spatial manipulations, such as rotations, reflections, or translations of patterns within the grid.
*   **Validation Limitations:** Relying on the LLM to validate the output's dimensionality and validity is insufficient. The LLM often misses inconsistencies or errors in the transformed grid.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Chain-of-thought with verification ineffective:** Implementing a multi-step chain-of-thought approach, even with verification steps, did not improve performance, indicating that the core issue lies in the initial rule extraction phase, not in the application or verification of the extracted rule.
*   **LLM Role Specialization doesn't address core issue:** Dividing the task into specialized agent roles (rule extraction expert, verification expert, etc.) did not overcome the LLM's fundamental limitations in abstract spatial reasoning within this dataset. The low accuracy (0.33 initially) and the subsequent 0.00 accuracy in later iterations suggests that the current approach to rule extraction, verification, and application is fundamentally flawed.
*   **Pure exploration unsuccessful:** Employing a pure exploration strategy without targeted guidance resulted in no accurate solutions, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of the task and highlighting the need for more structured and targeted approaches.
*   **400 INVALID_ARGUMENT Error:** Encountered errors like "400 INVALID_ARGUMENT. {'error': {'code': 400, 'message': 'thinking_config is not supported.', 'status': 'INVALID_ARGUMENT'}}" suggest compatibility problems with the API or framework used. Likely, using the thinking config is not supported by the model being employed in that specific use case.
*   **Iteration 7: LLM-driven Exploration ineffective:** The Exploration strategy with the current LLM-driven approach is ineffective for this dataset. The 0% accuracy indicates a fundamental problem with the system's ability to perform abstract reasoning and visual pattern recognition in this context. The hypothesis that LLMs can effectively generate and score transformation rules for this type of task is rejected with the current implementation. The decomposition of the problem into rule generation, scoring, application, and formatting does not guarantee success if the core reasoning component fails.
*   **Iteration 8: Exploitation strategy ineffective:** The 0.00 accuracy indicates a complete failure of the exploitation strategy with the current implementation. The reliance on LLM-driven rule extraction, verification, and application, in its current form, is insufficient for solving the grid transformation problems in this dataset. The experiment highlights the difficulty of abstract reasoning and pattern recognition tasks for LLMs, particularly when dealing with visual information represented in grids.
*   **Error detected during script repair (attempt 1): ERROR: Invalid rule extracted. [2025-05-07 19:24:15]** - Reinforces the recurring issue of inaccurate rule extraction.
*   **Error detected during script repair (attempt 2): ERROR: Error message present: "Error: Invalid rule extracted." [2025-05-07 19:24:30]** - Confirms the persistence of the "Invalid rule extracted" error even after attempts at repair.
*   **Error detected during script repair (attempt 3): ERROR: Unexpected keyword argument 'parts' in Models.generate_content() [2025-05-07 19:24:41]** - Suggests a potential incompatibility issue between the code and the `Models.generate_content()` function, indicating a need for careful version control and dependency management.
*   **Iteration 9: Direct Transformation Ineffective:** The strategy of directly transforming the input grid based on learned patterns is ineffective. While the LLM can describe the rules at a high level, it struggles to implement the rules precisely on unseen test cases, leading to 0.00 accuracy.
*   **Script Error encountered (Attempt 1): ERROR: Invalid output format. [2025-05-07 19:26:09]** - Indicates problems with the generated code producing the correct output structure.
*   **Script Error encountered (Attempt 2): ERROR: Unexpected keyword argument in API call. [2025-05-07 19:26:18]** - Suggests errors in API usage or configuration, possibly stemming from incorrect parameter names.
*   **Script Error encountered (Attempt 3): ERROR: google.genai has no attribute 'configure' [2025-05-07 19:26:26]** - Shows configuration issues with the `google.genai` library. Likely a setup problem or incorrect import statement.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Enhance Rule Extraction:** Focus on enhancing the system's ability to understand the relationships between input and output grids. Experiment with different prompting strategies that encourage the LLM to identify specific visual elements, spatial relationships, and color transformations. Consider using techniques like few-shot learning with more diverse examples.
    *   **Specialized Fine-tuning:** Consider fine-tuning a model specifically for rule extraction from grid-based data. This might involve training on a large dataset of grid transformation examples with associated rules.
    *   **Structured Output:** Modify the prompts to encourage the LLM to output the extracted rule in a more structured and machine-readable format (e.g., a formal language or a set of logical statements). This will facilitate automated verification and application.
*   **Implement Explicit Spatial Reasoning:** Incorporate mechanisms that explicitly handle spatial transformations like rotations, reflections, and translations. This could involve adding modules that pre-process the grids to detect such patterns or augment the LLM prompts with spatial information.
*   **Refine Rule Representation:** Explore alternative ways to represent transformation rules that are more precise and less ambiguous. Consider using formal languages or symbolic representations to capture the underlying logic of the transformations.
*   **Increase Example Variety:** The LLM might be overfitting to the specific examples provided. Introducing more variety in the training examples (grid sizes, color palettes, transformation types) could improve generalization.
*   **Debugging and Diagnostics:** Add more detailed logging and diagnostics to track the reasoning process of the LLM and identify where failures occur. This will help to pinpoint the specific weaknesses of the system.
*   **Enhance Spatial Reasoning Prompts:** Refine prompts to explicitly guide the LLM to consider spatial relationships (adjacency, symmetry, relative positions) when extracting rules. This may involve providing specific keywords or question sets to guide the reasoning process. Example: "Analyze the grid for rotational symmetry. Is there a center point around which the grid appears to rotate?".
*   **Focused Rule Extraction Prompts:** Design prompts that focus on extracting specific types of transformations (e.g., "Is there a rotation?", "Is there a reflection?", "Are colors being swapped?"). This could involve a menu-driven prompt design where the LLM is presented with potential transformation types and asked to evaluate their presence in the training examples.
*   **Data Augmentation:** Explore data augmentation techniques to provide more examples of specific transformation types, helping the LLM learn to recognize these patterns. This may involve creating synthetic training examples with rotations, reflections, etc. Ensure the augmented data is representative of the dataset's characteristics.
*   **Hybrid Approach with Symbolic Reasoning:** Combine the LLM with symbolic reasoning techniques. The LLM could be used to identify potential rules (e.g., "the rule involves swapping colors X and Y"), which are then validated and applied using a symbolic engine or Python script. This will require ensuring that code is syntactically correct to avoid `IndentationError` issues.
*   **Decomposition into Sub-tasks:** Break down the task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. For example: 1) Identify potential transformation types. 2) Precisely define the transformation parameters (e.g., rotation angle, reflection axis). 3) Apply the transformation to the test input. 4) Verify the output.
*   **Few-shot Learning with Demonstrations:** Provide the LLM with a small number of examples (few-shot learning) demonstrating the correct reasoning process for different transformation types. This could help the LLM learn to mimic the desired behavior.
*   **Explicit Instruction on Color Relationships:** Since the number of colors is limited, experiment with prompts that specifically ask the LLM to identify relationships between colors (e.g., "Does color X always become color Y?").
*   **Testing Different Model Architectures:** Consider evaluating different LLM architectures or fine-tuning the current model on a dataset of grid transformation problems.
*   **Address `thinking_config` Error:** Investigate the cause of the "thinking_config is not supported" error and either find a compatible configuration or avoid using that specific feature.
*   **Implement Code Validation Step:** Before attempting to execute automatically generated code, implement a code validation step (e.g., using a linter) to identify and correct syntax errors such as indentation problems.
*   **Enhance rule extraction:** Focus on improving the rule extraction agent. Consider techniques like:
    *   Breaking down the rules into simpler sub-rules (e.g., transformations on rows, columns, or specific color patterns).
    *   Using a different prompting strategy to elicit more accurate rule descriptions.
*   **Improve rule application:** Develop more robust mechanisms for applying extracted rules. Consider a symbolic execution approach where the rules are translated into executable code.
*   **Address dimensionality:** Implement a grid resizing or normalization step to handle grids of different dimensions, making pattern recognition more consistent.
*   **Implement unit tests for primitive grid transforms:** Implement deterministic unit tests that perform primitive operations on grids, and call those from the LLM. This could include transforms such as `fill_region`, `rotate_grid`, `replace_color` and `translate_region`.
*   **Introduce Visual Processing:** Explore incorporating computer vision techniques to pre-process the grid images and extract relevant features before rule extraction. This could help the LLM focus on the most salient aspects of the transformations.
*   **Iterative Rule Refinement:** Implement a feedback loop where the system evaluates the performance of the extracted rule on the training examples and uses this information to refine the rule iteratively.
*   **Constraints and Prior Knowledge:** Incorporate constraints and prior knowledge about common grid transformation operations (e.g., rotations, reflections, translations) into the rule extraction process. This can help guide the LLM towards plausible and valid rules.
*   **Address Reasoning Errors:** The LLM provides reasoning for its failures. Use this information to improve prompt engineering, and potentially fine-tune the LLM using techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to penalize common reasoning errors.
*   **Investigate `Models.generate_content()` incompatibility:** Identify the root cause of the "Unexpected keyword argument 'parts' in Models.generate_content()" error. Ensure correct versions of libraries and dependencies are used to resolve compatibility issues.
*   **Decompose Transformation Steps Further:** Break down the grid transformation process into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of a single `call_llm` for the entire transformation, use multiple calls for distinct sub-tasks (e.g., identifying specific features, applying localized transformations).
*   **Implement External Verification:** Replace the LLM-based validation step with deterministic, code-based verification functions. These functions should check for specific criteria like dimensionality, color constraints, and consistency with the identified transformation rule.
*   **Focus on Spatial Reasoning:** Add specific instructions or constraints to the prompt that emphasize the importance of spatial relationships and precise manipulations of patterns.
*   **Introduce Intermediate Reasoning Steps:** Prompt the LLM to produce intermediate representations of the transformation process, such as a step-by-step plan or a visual explanation of the rule application.
*   **Address "Invalid output format" error:** Examine the code generation process and output formatting to ensure it aligns with the expected grid structure. Introduce validation steps to confirm the output is a valid grid.
*   **Correct API configuration and Usage:** Review and correct any errors in the API configuration or usage, paying close attention to parameter names and required libraries. Double-check library versions and dependencies. Ensure proper setup of `google.genai`.

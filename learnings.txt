# Dataset-Specific Experiment Log: Question Answering

This document serves as a continuously updated log of patterns, strategies, and findings related to the question-answering task for this specific dataset. It prioritizes concrete, task-specific insights over general principles.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Question Type Dominance:** Predominantly *Who* questions, seeking individuals/groups associated with events, creations, or awards (e.g., "Who created Groove Coaster?"). "What" questions can focus on parts of names (e.g., "What was the first name of Ralph E. Oesper?").
*   **Answer Type:** Short-form, factual names, groups, dates/numbers, or numerical facts (e.g., "How many losses...?"). Precise details are crucial.
*   **Knowledge Breadth:** Wide range of topics (music production, chemistry history, oceanography, TV series details). Broad domain knowledge is needed.
*   **Question Specificity:** Varies from precise to requiring interpretation.
*   **Structure and Format:** Questions are natural language sentences; answers are noun phrases or names. Each entry has an ID field.
*   **Reasoning Type:** Primarily fact retrieval; answers are facts needing extraction from a knowledge source.
*   **Entity and Relationship Focus:** Questions contain entities (person, place, organization) and relationships (purchased, announced). The system needs to track and correlate information from potentially disparate sources across time or classification changes.
*   **Date Sensitivity:** Correctness is highly sensitive to dates; even slight variations are incorrect. Distinguish "October 20" vs. "21 of October." Questions demand precise factual recall, including years ("In which year did...") and months ("In which month of 2005...").
*   **Precise Date & Identity Focus:** Pinpoint accuracy is needed regarding dates or individual identities. Partial/approximate answers are incorrect.
*   **Factual Recall, Not Reasoning:** Questions primarily test factual recall rather than complex reasoning. Answers are likely directly stated in the knowledge source, but finding the exact right snippet is crucial.
*   **Varied Temporal Scope:** Questions span a range of historical periods.
*   **Need for Completeness:** Answers must include all parts requested in the question (e.g., day, month, and year when asked for).
*   **Complex Relationships:** Requires identifying relationships between entities across different time periods or classification schemes (e.g., genus changes, visit dates).
*   **Implicit Assumptions:** Some questions rely on implicit assumptions or background knowledge.
*   **Comparative Reasoning:** Requires the system to compare and contrast information (e.g., "moved *to* from *Turdus* *before* finally being classified").
*   **Entity Recognition & Disambiguation:** Questions involve named entities (people, organizations, awards) that require correct identification and disambiguation.
*   **Complex Relational Queries:** Understanding the relationship between multiple entities (e.g., person, achievement, organization) is key.
*   **Compound Information:** Questions often contain multiple pieces of information (name, title, location), requiring accurate integration and filtering. Example: "In which month of 2005 was the Lal Bahadur Shastri Dam... completed?"
*   **Ambiguity in "First" or "Pioneer" Questions:** Questions may have multiple valid answers or lack a definitive answer.
*   **Temporal Specificity:** Many questions require extraction of specific dates or time periods. Questions often involve specific dates, years, or periods (e.g., "...spend the year 1973-74...").
*   **Entity-Rich Context:** The questions frequently include detailed contextual information about the entities involved (e.g., "Satyanarayan Gangaram Pitroda (an Indian telecommunication engineer and entrepreneur)").
*   **Fact Verification Challenge:** The questions target factual knowledge that may require precise lookup.
*   **Specific Patch/Version Queries:** A significant portion of the questions requires pinpointing exact versions or patches for specific changes within games or software (e.g., "In what patch did..."). Demands precise information retrieval and accurate matching.
*   **Specific Fictional Worlds:** The dataset contains questions heavily reliant on knowledge of specific fictional worlds (e.g., "Severance").
*   **Relationship Inference:** Some questions (e.g., parent-child relationships) require inference based on the provided context, rather than direct factual recall.
*   **Date Specific Questions:** Significant portion of the questions require retrieving specific dates (day/month/year) associated with events or people. This demands precise information retrieval.
*   **Entity Recognition Importance:** The questions often revolve around named entities (people, organizations, telescopes) requiring accurate entity recognition and linking within the knowledge source.
*   **Complex Relational Reasoning:** Some questions require understanding and linking relationships between entities, such as a politician and the Prime Minister under whom they served.
*   **Fact Retrieval Focus:** (ITERATION 10 ADDITION) The questions primarily require retrieving specific factual information (dates, numerical values) from a source text, not complex reasoning or synthesis.
*   **Named Entity and Attribute Focus:** (ITERATION 10 ADDITION) Many questions revolve around identifying a named entity (e.g., "Gliese 146," "William Lawrence Morrison," "K\u00f6ln Frankfurter Stra\u00dfe station") and retrieving a specific attribute or property related to that entity (e.g., graduation year, opening date, apparent visual magnitude).
*   **Varied Question Structure:** (ITERATION 10 ADDITION) Questions employ different phrasing and grammatical structures to ask for the same types of information, posing a challenge for pattern-based question answering.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **NONE:** (Iteration 5 result) No aspect of the current strategy is working effectively for this dataset.
*   **Ineffective:** Direct LLM question answering without knowledge retrieval or verification (Baseline Experiment). Accuracy was only 10%.
*   **Ineffective:** Simple chain-of-thought approach using specialized LLM agents for each step (extraction, query generation, retrieval, answer generation, validation). Accuracy was 0%.
*   **Ineffective:** RAG implementation with current settings and the "explore" strategy (Iteration 4). RAG architecture with current validation loop (Iteration 5).
*   **Ineffective:** The validation loop alone, even with RAG (Iterations 2 and 5).
*   **Ineffective:** The RAG architecture, with its current validation loop, (Iteration 5). The `generate_query_and_validate` function isn't ensuring that the generated queries are precise enough to retrieve the exact information needed.
*   **Ineffective:** The accuracy of 0.67 in Iteration 7 indicates that simply decomposing the question and answering sub-questions is insufficient. The verification and, critically, the synthesis stages are hindering performance.
*    **Ineffective:** (ITERATION 10 ADDITION) The current RAG approach, even with the validation loop, is not effective for this dataset. The validation may not be strict enough or the prompt engineering may not be sufficient to guide the LLM to extract the *exact* information needed.
*   **Potentially Effective:** While overall accuracy is only 0.67, the LLM-ICE-FS (LLM Iterative Context Expansion with Focused Summarization) strategy from Iteration 8 does show promise in principle.
*   **Potentially Effective:** The validation loop approach has promise, but it needs to be coupled with more robust information retrieval (Iterations 2 and 5).
*   **Potentially Effective:** Decomposing the question is likely useful.
*   **Potentially Effective:** The use of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is promising. The framework itself allows for iterative refinement by generating a query, using it to find relevant information, then validating.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Factual Inaccuracy (Hallucination):** LLM provides incorrect facts (e.g., details about "Barcelona corners" or the "Belmont purchaser").
*   **Date Discrepancies:** Small differences in dates are marked as incorrect (e.g., "October 20" vs. "21 of October").
*   **Incomplete Answers:** LLM fails to provide all parts of the answer (e.g., providing only the month and year).
*   **Incorrect Entity/Relationship Extraction:** The system fails to accurately extract the precise entities and relationships (e.g., "American University" instead of something relevant, or "Robert P. Sharp" instead of "Carl Owen Dunbar").
*   **Inability to Discern Temporal Order:** The system struggles to correctly identify the sequence of events (e.g., the ruby-throated bulbul question).
*   **Inaccurate Information Retrieval & Validation:** The system struggles to validate if information retrieved is in fact valid (Iterations 1, 3, 4, 5).
*   **Lack of Reliable Source Attribution:** Difficult to determine the source of the error, making debugging challenging.
*   **Incorrect Year Retrieval:** The system incorrectly retrieves the year (e.g., "1999" instead of "2013" for Maharaj Kishan Bhan in Iteration 3).
*   **Handling Ambiguity in "First" Questions:** The system struggled with questions seeking the "first" of something in Iteration 3.
*   **Context Validation Inadequacy:** The LLM struggles to validate the context against the question (Iterations 3, 4, 5).
*   **Script Errors:** Script errors encountered during attempted repairs (e.g., `ERROR: Answer not found in context`, `ERROR: Gemini API call failed...`, `ERROR: Could not find the answer.`).
*   **Failure to Extract Numerical Answers:** RAG approach fails when questions require numerical information (Iteration 4).
*   **Granularity Mismatch in Date Retrieval:** The system fails when a question demands a precise date (e.g., "November 30, 1949") but the retrieved information provides a broader range (e.g., "1949 to February 21, 1974"). (Iteration 5).
*   **"Answer Not Found" Errors for Existing Answers:** The system incorrectly reports "Answer Not found" even when the correct answer exists (Iteration 5).
*   **Query Validation Ineffective:** The `generate_query_and_validate` function isn't ensuring that the generated queries are precise enough (Iteration 5).
*   **Date Extraction Bottleneck:** The system fails when it cannot find the exact date or time period mentioned in the golden answer within the retrieved snippets.
*   **Insufficient Temporal Reasoning:** The system acknowledges Otto Schluter was a professor but cannot extract the date range (1911-1959).
*   **Inability to Retrieve Patch Numbers:** The "Mechanical Glove" example demonstrates a failure to retrieve the specific patch number (1.2.3).
*   **Answer Synthesis Breakdown:** The core issue is the failure to integrate the sub-question answers effectively (Iteration 7). The system can decompose the question, but struggles to synthesize a coherent and accurate final answer.
*   **Premature "Not Revealed" Conclusion:** The system incorrectly concludes that information is unavailable too quickly, especially when questions require inference or dealing with niche fictional settings (Iteration 8).
*   **Insufficient Contextual Depth:** The system likely doesn't expand the context deeply enough to uncover the relationships required for inference (Iteration 8).
*   **Reliance on Negative Constraints:** The prompt relies on negative constraints in the validation step, leading to false negatives (Iteration 8).
*    **Failure to Retrieve Specific Dates:** The primary failure, exemplified by the Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar question, highlights the system's difficulty in retrieving specific dates, even when the information might be present in the knowledge source. The system returns "Answer not found" instead of extracting the correct date (4 September 2004).
*   **Incorrect Value Extraction/Misinterpretation:** (ITERATION 10 ADDITION) The system frequently fails to extract the *precise* value from the source text, even when the relevant entity is correctly identified. This suggests a problem with how the LLM parses and interprets numerical values or dates. Example: Gliese 146's apparent visual magnitude was reported as 9.34 instead of 8.64.
*   **"Answer Not Found" Errors despite Presence of Answer:** (ITERATION 10 ADDITION) The system sometimes incorrectly claims that the answer isn't found, even though the ground truth suggests it is present in the source text. This points to issues with the retrieval or validation stages. The system might be missing subtle cues or keywords that indicate the answer's presence.
*   **Date Formatting and Specificity:** (ITERATION 10 ADDITION) The system seems to struggle with date retrieval and formatting, especially when the question asks for month, day, and year. This is visible in the K\u00f6ln Frankfurter Stra\u00dfe station example.

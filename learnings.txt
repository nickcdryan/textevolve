# Math Question Dataset: Evolving Research Log

This document serves as a dynamic research log, capturing our evolving understanding, strategies, and findings related to the task of solving math questions from the provided dataset. It prioritizes concrete, task-specific insights.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Mathematical Content Variety:** The dataset contains a diverse set of math problems, encompassing arithmetic, number theory, and probability, in addition to algebra, geometry, and more complex topics like combinatorics. This requires the system to handle a broad range of mathematical concepts and problem-solving strategies. Examples include divisibility rules, prime factorization, area calculations, probability calculations, and counting problems with constraints. Number theory problems involving divisors and factors are common.
*   **Question Content:** Predominantly multi-step mathematical reasoning problems. Requires a combination of algebra, geometry, and number theory. Questions range in complexity, requiring both computational and conceptual understanding. Often numerical calculation and logical reasoning is required.
*   **Mathematical Formulation:** Questions are primarily mathematical problems, often requiring symbolic manipulation (using LaTeX notation), number theory concepts, or geometric reasoning.
*   **Multi-Step Solutions:** The "expected" answers often involve multiple steps of logical deduction or calculation. This reinforces the necessity of decomposing problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
*   **Word Problem Complexity:** Questions are presented as word problems, often involving fictional scenarios or abstract concepts (e.g., "Penteria"). This necessitates strong natural language understanding to correctly translate the problem into mathematical terms.
*   **Answer Style:** Concise, step-by-step solutions using LaTeX. Final answers often boxed. Answers often need to be expressed within a specific range or format (e.g., "an integer from 0 to 16, inclusive"), indicating a need for the model to be precise with its final result. Numerical answers, often simplified common fractions.
*   **Formatting:** Uses LaTeX for mathematical expressions and Asymptote code for diagrams. Accurate LaTeX interpretation is crucial. The inclusion of diagrams using `[asy]` is a common feature.
*   **Numerical Focus:** Many questions require finding specific numerical values (e.g., smallest possible value, probability, arithmetic mean), demanding precise calculations.
*   **Reasoning Types:** Deductive, algebraic manipulation, spatial, computational, logical, and combinatorial. Combinatorial and probabilistic reasoning.
*   **Hidden Constraints and Assumptions:** Problems often rely on implicit constraints or assumptions that are not explicitly stated, making accurate interpretation challenging. For example, the "Penteria" problem implicitly assumes the initial population is a positive integer. Explicitly add constraints to the problem that the initial population must be a positive integer (e.g., in "Penteria"-like problems).
*   **Dataset Size and Diversity:** The dataset contains sufficient variety in topics (number theory, algebra, probability, etc.) and difficulty to necessitate testing robustness and generalizability. This includes abstract concepts and creative problem-solving skills.
*   **Multi-faceted problems:** The dataset contains questions that often require a combination of different mathematical concepts (e.g., geometry and vector algebra, number theory and combinatorics, probability and spatial reasoning). This necessitates a broad knowledge base and the ability to synthesize information from different domains.
*   **Visual component integration:** Many questions include diagrams or visual aids (e.g., geometric figures, game boards) that are crucial for understanding and solving the problem. The system needs to be able to effectively interpret and utilize this visual information. The spatial reasoning and extraction of numerical data from the images is a common requirement. For example, determining valid board positions after N moves.
*   **Constraint-heavy problems:** A significant number of problems impose constraints on the solution, such as restrictions on digit usage or valid moves on a game board. The system must be able to explicitly identify, represent, and enforce these constraints during the solution process.
*   **Variable Definitions & State Management:** A common pattern is the presence of defined variables and relationships that need to be understood and applied (e.g., "$n$ is the inverse of $2 \\pmod{17}$"). This requires the model to maintain state and correctly substitute values.
*   **Fractions, Modular Arithmetic, and Algebraic Expressions:** The dataset consists of math problems, often requiring a sequence of calculations and manipulations involving fractions, modular arithmetic, and algebraic expressions.
*   **Repeating Decimal Expansions:** Problems involving repeating decimal expansions pose a challenge.
*   **Answers often require simplification:** expressing radicals in simplest form, providing probabilities as common fractions.
*   **Geometry problems involving geometric figures or concepts:** Geometry problems often require visual reasoning or the application of geometric theorems (Pythagorean theorem, area/volume calculations).
*   **Combinatorial problems:** The dataset contains problems that require counting the number of ways to arrange or select objects, subject to certain constraints (e.g., "relatively prime" condition).
*   **Precision and Detail:** Answers often require precise numerical calculations, and even a small error in an intermediate step can lead to a wrong final answer. The octahedron problem highlights the importance of accurate geometric relationships.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Geometry problems involving area/circumference calculations, vector geometry.
    *   Number theory problems involving divisibility, digit sums, and prime factorization.
    *   Algebra problems involving solving equations.
    *   Probability Problems involving calculations based on provided sets or spatial reasoning on a game board.
    *   Arithmetic problems involving distance and digit manipulation.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Ineffective (Baseline):** Direct LLM call. Accuracy ~50%. Insufficient for the complexity and precision required.
*   **Decompose-Solve-Verify:** Breaking down complex problems into manageable sub-problems. This has proven effective in recent experiments, contributing to a high accuracy rate in some iterations. It is particularly useful for math problems with multiple steps. The approach seems to work better when individual sub-problems are relatively straightforward. However, if the decomposition does not lead to a manageable and systematic enumeration strategy, it quickly becomes unwieldy (e.g., combinatorics problem).
*   **Reflexion-Enhanced Solution Synthesis:** Decomposing the problem into initial solution, critique, refined solution, and validation stages seems to provide a structured approach that encourages more careful consideration of each step. While Reflexion *did* identify errors in initial solutions, it didn't consistently lead to *corrected* solutions; synthesis often failed to integrate the critique effectively.
*   **Using the distance formula:** Useful strategy to solve geometry questions.
*   **Coordinate Geometry Setup:** Setting up coordinate systems is helpful in geometry problems (like the octahedron example). However, establishing the correct relationships between the coordinates and distances is essential for accurate reasoning.
*   **Multi-Example Prompting:** Guiding the LLM with multiple examples improves accuracy by providing relevant context. Multi-example prompting is useful for guiding the LLM in each stage (decomposition, solving, synthesis, verification). This helps to align the model's reasoning with the desired approach. However, multi-example prompting alone does not mitigate underlying weaknesses (e.g., in combinatorial reasoning).
*   **Specialized System Instructions:** Using specialized system instructions for each step of the process (e.g., "expert at decomposing complex math problems") enhances the quality of the LLM's output. This applies specifically to the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" approach.
*   **Explicit Knowledge Retrieval and Verification:** Explicitly retrieving and verifying knowledge seems beneficial as a first step. The accuracy hinges on *how* the knowledge is used in the subsequent synthesis step.
*   **(Future) Implement a constraint-aware search algorithm:** For problems involving constraints (e.g., valid moves, digit restrictions), integrate a search algorithm (e.g., backtracking, breadth-first search) into the solution synthesis agent. This algorithm should systematically explore the solution space while explicitly enforcing all constraints.
*   **(Future) Develop a visual reasoning module:** Enhance the system's ability to interpret and extract information from diagrams and visual aids. Consider incorporating techniques for image analysis, shape recognition, and spatial reasoning.
*   Explicit constraint listing: Before calculations, explicitly list all known constraints and dependencies in a structured format (e.g., a constraint satisfaction problem). The system needs better techniques for ensuring these constraints are satisfied during solution generation.
*   Decomposing the problem into smaller, more manageable steps appears to be a generally useful strategy.
*   Retrieving relevant knowledge is also helpful.
*   Combining LLM techniques like knowledge retrieval, problem decomposition, solution generation, reflection/critique, solution synthesis, and verification has potential.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Arithmetic and Logical Calculation Errors:** Consistent errors in basic arithmetic and logical calculations (e.g., median, probability). *Example: Incorrectly calculating the median in the stem and leaf plot question.* The system frequently makes mistakes in arithmetic, particularly when dealing with decimal expansions (e.g., calculating digits of repeating decimals) and modular arithmetic (e.g., finding modular inverses and computing powers modulo n). This often leads to completely incorrect final answers. Arithmetic errors during simplification, especially with radicals. The LLM doesn't consistently verify these calculations. The combinatorial problem's lengthy initial solution highlights how even small arithmetic errors in counting or combining sub-cases can invalidate the entire answer. There's a lack of robust error checking or correction in intermediate stages.
*   **Inaccurate combinatorial reasoning:** Struggling with counting valid possibilities (e.g., bead problem failing to consider all sequences). This indicates a failure to systematically explore all possible scenarios and their associated probabilities.
*   **Misinterpretation of Problem Context:** Failing to fully understand the constraints or conditions stated in the problem, leading to incorrect solution paths. *Example: LLM jumps directly to a numerical answer without proper justification in divisibility question.* In the "Penteria" problem, the LLM does not properly handle the hourly reset condition.
*   **Constraint violation:** Failure to properly consider the constraints of the problem (e.g., dice roll problem).
*   **LaTeX Interpretation Issues:** Subtle errors in interpreting LaTeX can lead to misconstrued equations and wrong answers.
*   **Difficulty:** Understanding the problem statement, choosing the right approach and applying the correct formulas, performing accurate calculations, dealing with multi-step problems, interpreting visual information from diagrams.
*   **Edge Cases/Complexities:** Problems with subtle wording that can lead to misinterpretation. Questions requiring creative problem-solving or non-obvious insights. Diagrams that may be misleading or require careful analysis. Calculations involving fractions, radicals, or other potentially error-prone operations.
*   **`NoneType` Error in LLM Call:** The LLM call consistently failed due to receiving a `NoneType` argument. This suggests a problem with the script's data processing flow *before* the `call_llm` function. A variable expected to hold a string or iterable (likely the prompt or a list of sub-questions) is unexpectedly becoming `None`.
    *   **Script Error Log [2025-05-28 01:51:54]:** ERROR: TypeError: 'NoneType' is not iterable
    *   **Script Error Log [2025-05-28 01:51:59]:** ERROR: NoneType not iterable
    *   **Script Error Log [2025-05-28 01:52:04]:** ERROR: TypeError: 'NoneType' is not iterable
*   **Inconsistent Application of Constraints:** The primary failure mode is the model's inability to consistently apply constraints within the problem statement.
*   **Misinterpreting Problem Logic:** Even with a structured analysis, the "Solution Generator" struggles to translate the analysis into correct mathematical operations.
*   **Inability to handle implicit constraints:** The set member values of {2, 4, 12, 14, 21, 28, 98} are all positive integers. The solution does not seem to check that the initial population of the Penteria problem should also be a positive integer.
*   **Ambiguity and Complexity:** Even with successful strategies like "Decompose-Solve-Verify," more challenging or ambiguous questions could reveal new failure modes.
*   **Incomplete Enumeration (Probability/Combinatorics):** Demonstrates a key failure mode: the inability to systematically enumerate all possible valid scenarios. The model identifies *some* paths/cases that lead to the target, but fails to account for all of them, leading to an underestimation. The failure occurs because the system lacks a robust search or backtracking mechanism to explore the entire solution space while respecting the problem's constraints.
*   **Missing edge cases and invalid paths:** The system needs to be more thorough and explicitly show *why* each possibility is (or isn't) valid.
*   **Weak constraint enforcement:** Constraints are not consistently enforced, resulting in the inclusion of impossible sequences of moves or invalid combinations.
*   **Lack of Precision:** Even when the overall strategy is correct, small inaccuracies in calculations or a failure to adhere to the required answer format (e.g., failing to reduce modulo 17) lead to incorrect answers. This indicates a lack of "carefulness" in the execution.
*   **Error Propagation:** The "Decompose-Solve-Verify" strategy is highly susceptible to error propagation.
*   **Difficulty with Repeating Patterns:** Problems involving repeating decimal expansions pose a challenge.
*   **Lack of Quantitative Validation:** The validation step seems more focused on reiterating the logic rather than performing independent numerical checks.
*   **Self-critique Limitations:** The self-critique stage doesn't reliably identify subtle arithmetic errors.
*   **Incorrect Geometric Assumptions:** In the octahedron problem, the system makes unwarranted assumptions about distance relationships.
*   **Computational Complexity with Geometric Problems:** The system gets stuck in long calculations or complex geometric deductions without reaching a solution within the allowed time.
*   **Incomplete problem decomposition:** The agent may decompose the problem into steps, but fail to decompose far enough. The LLM may still be required to complete complex combinatorial reasoning steps, which it does poorly.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Experiment 0 (Baseline):**
    *   **Description:** Direct call to the LLM with the question.
    *   **Accuracy:** ~50%
    *   **Findings:** Inadequate. Requires more than just general knowledge; necessitates precise calculation and logical reasoning capabilities. Calculation errors and misinterpretations of context are frequent.
*   **Experiment 1:**
    *   **Description:** Attempt to implement a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach by breaking down the question into sub-questions.
    *   **Accuracy:** 0% (LLM call failed consistently)
    *   **Findings:** The core CoT strategy remains untested *in isolation*. The LLM call consistently fails due to a `NoneType` error originating *before* the `call_llm` function. Further debugging is needed to identify the source of the `None` value. Error handling only catches exceptions *during* the LLM call, not problems in data preparation *before* the call. Highlighted the importance of robust input validation. The underlying principle of CoT, however, contributed to the later "Decompose-Solve-Verify" success.
*   **Experiment 2:**
    *   **Description:** Implemented a modular approach with "Problem Analyzer," "Solution Generator," and "Solution Validator" agents. The "Problem Analyzer" generated structured JSON output.
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.33
    *   **Findings:** Partially supported the hypothesis that decomposing the problem into analysis, solution generation, and validation steps helps in math problem-solving. However, the low accuracy indicates that the current implementation of this approach is not robust enough. Highlights the limitations of the Gemini LLM in complex mathematical reasoning, especially when dealing with implicit constraints and nuanced problem logic. Ultimately led to the development of the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" strategy.
*   **Experiment 3:**
    *   **Description:** Implemented the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" approach with multi-example prompting and specialized system instructions.
    *   **Accuracy:** 1.00
    *   **Findings:** Confirms that the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" approach, combined with multi-example prompting and specialized system instructions, can effectively solve math word problems, at least on the tested sample. However, further testing is needed to ensure robustness and generalizability.
*   **Experiment 4:**
    *   **Description:** "Knowledge Retrieval and Solution Synthesis" approach.
    *   **Findings:** The "Knowledge Retrieval and Solution Synthesis" approach shows promise, but its effectiveness is limited by the subsequent solution synthesis step. Retrieving relevant knowledge is not sufficient if the system cannot apply it correctly and exhaustively to the problem. The failure to consider all possible scenarios suggests that exploration is not wide enough. The system failed to systematically enumerate all valid scenarios and prematurely deemed other paths as invalid without fully justifying why. Constraints were not consistently enforced.
*   **Experiment 5:**
    *   **Description:** Testing "Decompose-Solve-Verify" on a new set of problems involving fractions, modular arithmetic, and algebraic expressions.
    *   **Accuracy:** 60%
    *   **Findings:** The "Decompose-Solve-Verify" strategy, while conceptually sound, is highly susceptible to error propagation. The 60% accuracy indicates that the core reasoning framework is working to some extent, but the model needs significant improvement in its ability to perform calculations and maintain precision. The experiment highlights the importance of robust calculation and meticulousness, which are challenging for LLMs.
*   **Experiment 6:**
    *   **Description:** Reflexion-Enhanced Solution Synthesis approach.
    *   **Accuracy:** 80%
    *   **Findings:** The Reflexion-Enhanced Solution Synthesis approach demonstrates potential, achieving 80% accuracy, but is vulnerable to arithmetic mistakes. The self-critique stage, while logically sound, doesn't reliably identify subtle arithmetic errors.
*   **Experiment 7:**
    *   **Description:** Testing "Decompose-Solve-Verify" and Reflexion on a mix of combinatorics, geometry, and algebra problems.
    *   **Findings:** The "Decompose-Solve-Verify" strategy shows initial promise in breaking down complex problems. However, as seen in the combinatorial problem, if the decomposition does not lead to a manageable and systematic enumeration strategy, it quickly becomes unwieldy. Reflexion didn't consistently lead to *corrected* solutions. The synthesis step often failed to integrate the critique effectively. The strategy struggles with questions that are very constrained and require a lot of enumeration of possible options. In the octahedron problem, the system makes unwarranted assumptions about distance relationships.
*   **Experiment 8:**
    *   **Description:** Testing a combination of LLM techniques like knowledge retrieval, problem decomposition, solution generation, reflection/critique, solution synthesis, and verification.
    *   **Accuracy:** 86%
    *   **Findings:** Confirmed that the approach of combining LLM techniques has potential. However, the current implementation struggles with computationally intensive geometric problems, leading to timeout errors.
*   **Experiment 9:**
    *   **Description:** Refinement of Decomposition Step.
    *   **Accuracy:** 40%
    *   **Findings:** Refinement of decomposition step by adding validation was insufficient to address underlying weakness in combinatorial reasoning. LLM struggles with combinatorics, even when individual steps are validated. Multi-example prompting ineffective.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

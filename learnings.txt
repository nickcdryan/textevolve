## Knowledge Synthesis: Iteration 7

This document synthesizes learnings from experiments on the meeting scheduling dataset.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   The questions consistently present a role-playing prompt, task description, participant schedules, and a request to find a suitable meeting time. _Example: "You are an expert at scheduling meetings... You need to schedule a meeting... Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints"_. (Iteration 0 & 1)
*   The questions follow a consistent template: introduction setting the expert role, task definition including constraints (participants, duration, time window), existing schedules for participants, and the request to find a suitable meeting time. (Iteration 2)
*   The questions follow a structured format: task description, participant schedules, and constraints/preferences. (Iteration 3)
*   The questions follow a consistent format: an introductory prompt defining the task, a `TASK` section outlining the meeting requirements (participants, duration, days), a `Here are the existing schedules...` section detailing each participant's availability, and a final instruction to `Find a time that works...`. (Iteration 4)
*   The questions are structured as a scenario description followed by participant schedules and preferences. They consistently follow the "You are an expert at scheduling meetings..." prompt. (Iteration 5)
*   The questions follow a consistent template: Task description followed by specific schedules for each participant, and a final question asking for a meeting time. (Iteration 6)
*   The questions follow a consistent template: a role-playing prompt ("You are an expert at scheduling meetings"), followed by constraints on participant schedules, meeting duration, and preferences. This structure allows for focused information extraction. (Iteration 7)
*   The schedules are described in free-form natural language, indicating blocked time slots for each participant on specific days. This unstructured format necessitates robust parsing techniques. _Example: "Nicholas is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30..."_. (Iteration 0 & 1)
*   Schedules are described as blocked time ranges for each participant, which needs to be parsed and understood in the context of available working hours. (Iteration 3)
*   The schedule information is presented as text describing blocked time slots for each participant, with specific start and end times. This requires accurate parsing of textual time ranges and participant names. (Iteration 4)
*   Participant schedules are presented as a list of busy time blocks for each person on specific days. This structure is highly repetitive and predictable. (Iteration 5)
*   The schedules are provided as time ranges (e.g., "10:00 to 10:30"), requiring parsing of both time and participant names. (Iteration 6)
*   Schedules are presented in a verbose, natural language format, describing blocked time slots for each participant across multiple days. This format is more complex to parse than a structured data format (e.g., JSON). (Iteration 7)
*   Many questions include participant preferences, adding constraints to the scheduling task. _Example: "would rather not meet on..."_. (Iteration 0)
*   TASK definitions detail participants, duration, and preferences, following an introductory instruction. _Example: "You are an expert at scheduling meetings...", TASK definition, existing schedules, request to find a suitable time_. (Iteration 1)
*   Constraints vary in complexity: some participants are entirely free, while others have multiple blocked time slots. (Iteration 1)
*   Meeting durations are expressed in mixed formats (e.g., "half an hour", "30 minutes"). (Iteration 2)
*   Participant schedules are given as ranges, e.g., "9:00 to 9:30". (Iteration 2)
*   The "SOLUTION:" section at the end of the question requires generating a specific meeting time based on constraints. (Iteration 3)
*   The solutions are expected to provide a specific day and time range that accommodates all participants and adheres to the initial constraints. (Iteration 4)
*   Preferences are soft constraints, often involving avoiding certain days or times, which complicates the scheduling logic compared to strictly mandatory time blocks. (Iteration 5)
*   Constraints (e.g., "Jose can not meet on Monday after 15:30") are often included, adding a layer of complexity to the time slot selection. (Iteration 6)
*   The tasks involve finding a *single*, *earliest* meeting time that satisfies all constraints, making the problem a constrained optimization task within the temporal domain. (Iteration 7)

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   The use of an LLM (Gemini via `call_llm`) for extracting meeting details shows promise, given the structured format of the input questions. LLMs are good at structured information extraction. (Iteration 2)
*   The overall architecture of extracting details, validating them, generating candidate times, and checking constraints is a reasonable problem-solving approach for this dataset. (Iteration 2)
*   The high-level multi-agent approach is reasonable but needs improvement. Decomposing the problem into information extraction, constraint checking, and time suggestion is a sound strategy. (Iteration 3)
*   Decomposing the problem into `extract_meeting_data`, `validate_extracted_data`, and `find_meeting_time` stages is a reasonable approach. This modularity allows for targeted improvements in each area. (Iteration 4)
*   Using the LLM for information extraction is appropriate given the complexity of parsing the textual schedule descriptions. The `call_llm` function is central to the solution. (Iteration 4)
*   The use of chain-of-thought reasoning with examples in the LLM prompts is useful, as it helps guide the LLM to produce the desired output format. (Iteration 3)
*   Decomposing the problem into information extraction, time finding, and verification steps is a reasonable high-level approach. This worked to achieve an 80% accuracy. (Iteration 5)
*   Using LLMs to extract the meeting details is a good starting point given the complexity of the natural language descriptions. (Iteration 5)
*   Decomposing the problem into extraction, suggestion, and verification stages seems to be a viable strategy. Each stage benefits from a dedicated LLM call with specific instructions. (Iteration 6)
*   Using structured JSON output for the extracted meeting details allows for easier programmatic manipulation and verification of the extracted information. (Iteration 6)
*   Using the LLM for information extraction of participants, constraints, and schedule information is generally effective for interpreting the natural language input. The ability to handle varied sentence structures in the schedule descriptions is valuable. (Iteration 7)
*   The system's modular design, with separate functions for extraction, time-finding, and verification, allows for targeted debugging and improvements. This makes the process easier to improve at a specific function. (Iteration 7)
*   Using LLM to suggest earliest possible time (find_meeting_time) is a good idea. (Iteration 7)

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **LLM API Connectivity Issues:** The inability to reliably connect to the LLM API (Gemini Pro) is a critical failure point, halting the entire process. (Iteration 1)
*   **Invalid JSON Output from LLM:** The LLM's inability to consistently generate valid JSON output for the `extract_meeting_details` function causes `json.loads` to fail, stopping the process. This highlights the fragility of relying on precise LLM output formats. (Iteration 0)
*   **Schedule Parsing Complexity:** The unstructured, natural language format of the schedule descriptions makes reliable information extraction difficult, even with LLMs. Slight variations in phrasing can lead to parsing errors. _Example: "Nicholas is busy on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30..." vs. "Nicholas cannot attend from 9am to 9:30am on Mondays"_. (Iteration 0 & 1)
*   **Hardcoded and Brittle String Parsing:** The hardcoded and brittle string parsing in `generate_candidate_times` regarding meeting duration leads to complete failure. The system does not generalize to durations expressed in words ("half an hour"). (Iteration 2)
*   **Lack of Error Handling in `call_llm`:** Specific exceptions (e.g., API rate limits, invalid API key) are not being caught in `call_llm`, preventing fallback strategies. (Iteration 1)
*   Reliance on deterministic code for tasks that LLMs can handle (like duration parsing) reduces robustness. (Iteration 2)
*   **Schedule Intersection Errors:** The `suggest_meeting_time` agent failed to accurately intersect the schedules of multiple participants. For example, it missed that Mark was busy from 9:30-10:00 in the first error case, leading to a wrong time suggestion. This occurs because the LLM doesn't meticulously compare all schedules to find the *mutually* available slots. (Iteration 3)
*   **Preference Handling:** The `suggest_meeting_time` agent sometimes overlooks specific preferences. In the third error case, Kathleen's preference to not meet after 14:30 was not strictly enforced, and a later meeting time was suggested. (Iteration 3)
*   **Day selection errors:** The agent might miss the earliest available time slot. (Iteration 3)
*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The primary failure mode is the system proposing meeting times that directly conflict with the provided schedules. *Example: "Wednesday, 13:00 - 14:00" clashes with Jason's blocked time on Wednesday (12:00-13:00, 13:30-14:30). This demonstrates the LLM is either failing to accurately extract the constraints, is misinterpreting the time slots, or is not properly applying the constraints when finding a free slot.* (Iteration 4)
*   **Incorrect Date Handling:** Proposing meetings on the wrong day when multiple days are possibilities, as shown in the second example, demonstrates the LLM is not processing the date constraints properly. *Example: Proposing Tuesday instead of Monday when Monday would have worked with the schedules.* (Iteration 4)
*   The sequential workflow, while logical, might be hindering the system's ability to recover from errors in early stages. If `extract_meeting_data` makes a mistake, the subsequent stages will likely fail, too. (Iteration 4)
*   The system incorrectly calculates available meeting slots based on participant schedules. In the example provided, the schedules extraction and constraints understanding process misses some valid meeting times and days (e.g., Thursday at 13:00). (Iteration 5)
*   The system appears to prioritize soft constraints (avoiding certain days) over hard constraints (finding any valid time within the schedule). The model prioritizes later valid times based on preferences, failing to produce the first valid time found. (Iteration 5)
*   The intersection of availability times is not being accurately calculated. One error example showed the system proposed 12:30-13:00 while the correct answer was 15:00-15:30. This suggests issues with either correctly parsing the schedules or logically comparing the time ranges to find a common slot. (Iteration 6)
*   Constraints, like "Jose can not meet on Monday after 15:30", are not consistently incorporated when finding available slots. (Iteration 6)
*   Even when multiple days are provided as options, the system doesn't reliably find correct solutions, indicating failures in tracking day-specific availabilities across multiple participants. (Iteration 6)
*   The reliance on LLMs for every step (extraction, suggestion, and verification) likely exacerbates the issues with accurate time calculation, since LLMs are not designed for precise arithmetic tasks. (Iteration 6)
*   **Inaccurate calculation and listing of available time slots for each participant** is the main problem. This leads to incorrect overlapping slot identification and a failure to find the true earliest available time. The current approach may not be accurately parsing complex schedule overlaps. For example, the agent incorrectly lists Zachary's availabilities in one case, leading to a Monday, 9:00-9:30 proposed time when it is actually 11:00-11:30. (Iteration 7)
*   The system sometimes fails to consider all constraints properly when suggesting the meeting time. The model struggles with temporal reasoning - it seems to be good at extracting availability, but struggles to calculate the overlap. (Iteration 7)
*   The "earliest availability" requirement is not always correctly handled. The system may identify a valid time slot but not necessarily the *absolute earliest* one, leading to mismatches with the expected output (e.g., choosing 9:00 when 11:00 is the earliest). (Iteration 7)

**4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS**

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** A few-shot LLM can reliably extract structured information (meeting details, schedules) from the unstructured input text.
    *   **Result:** REJECTED. The LLM failed to produce consistently parsable JSON, rendering the entire approach ineffective.
    *   **Finding:** Systems relying on precise LLM output formats are fragile.
*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** A chain-of-thought approach *could* work for this task.
    *   **Result:** UNTESTED due to LLM API connectivity failure.
    *   **Finding:** A working LLM API connection is a critical dependency for the entire system.
*   **Iteration 2:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Use an LLM-driven approach for extracting meeting details, validating them, generating candidate times, and checking constraints will result in accurate meeting schedules.
    *   **Result:** REJECTED (0% accuracy). The brittle duration parsing in `generate_candidate_times` caused complete system failure, demonstrating the need for flexible input parsing.
    *   **Finding:** Although other parts of the architecture leveraged LLMs, inflexible parsing of key information like meeting duration caused total failure.
*   **Iteration 3:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** A multi-agent approach with chain-of-thought prompting can successfully schedule meetings by extracting data, checking constraints, and suggesting times.
    *   **Result:** REJECTED (0% accuracy). The LLM failed to accurately intersect schedules, handle preferences, and consistently select the earliest available time. The initial assumption about the LLM's constraint satisfaction abilities was incorrect.
    *   **Finding:** The multi-agent approach with CoT prompting, in its current form, is insufficient to solve the meeting scheduling problem accurately. The assumption that the LLM will correctly manage complex schedule intersections and constraint satisfaction with the given prompting strategy was rejected.
*   **Iteration 4:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** A modular approach using `extract_meeting_data`, `validate_extracted_data`, and `find_meeting_time` can achieve reasonable accuracy in scheduling meetings.
    *   **Result:** PARTIALLY ACCEPTED (60% accuracy). While the structure is promising, inaccurate constraint handling and date selection remain significant issues.
    *   **Finding:** The LLM is struggling to accurately extract and apply all constraints, especially regarding date and time conflicts. The core structure shows promise, but constraint handling is a major bottleneck.
*   **Iteration 5:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** An exploration-focused iteration to find the best approach would give reasonable results.
    *   **Result:** PARTIALLY ACCEPTED (80% accuracy). The core approach of extracting, finding time, and verification is promising but needs accuracy improvements.
    *   **Finding:** Accurate calculation of available meeting slots based on schedules and prioritization of hard constraints are key areas for improvements.
*   **Iteration 6:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Continuing the decomposition strategy will further improve the meeting scheduling results.
    *   **Result:** Inconclusive. The modular approach remains promising, but time calculation and constraint handling remain problematic.
    *   **Finding:** The reliance on LLMs for availability intersection is a fundamental limitation. Deterministic code is required for accurate time calculations.
*   **Iteration 7:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Refining the core extraction and scheduling logic will yield more accurate results.
    *   **Result:** PARTIALLY ACCEPTED (70% accuracy). The modular approach remains sound, but accurate calculation of time slots is still a bottleneck.
    *   **Finding:** The error analysis indicates a clear need to focus on enhancing the accuracy of available time slot calculation and constraint satisfaction, instead of major architectural changes.

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

*   **CRITICAL:** Replace the LLM-driven time availability intersection calculation with a deterministic, code-based solution. Convert the extracted time ranges into a structured data format (e.g., a list of busy intervals for each participant), and then use Python functions to find available slots. This increases precision when comparing time intervals. (Iteration 6)
*   **CRITICAL:** Replace the inflexible string parsing in `generate_candidate_times` with an LLM call to parse the meeting duration. The LLM should identify the duration in minutes regardless of whether it's expressed numerically or in words. (Iteration 2)
*   **CRITICAL: Resolve LLM API Connectivity:** Prioritize resolving the API connectivity issues before further experimentation. This includes verifying the API key, ensuring the Gemini Pro model is accessible, and adding robust error handling with retry mechanisms or fallback strategies within the `call_llm` function. (Iteration 1)
*   Before sending the extracted information to the time suggestion stage, implement a verification step using Python code to ensure all extracted schedules are valid and that time ranges are logically consistent. (Iteration 6)
*   Incorporate the constraint handling directly into the Python code to ensure that all constraints are met when finding the availability intersection. (Iteration 6)
*   Implement more robust error logging to pinpoint exactly where the availability calculation is failing. (Iteration 6)
*   Improve the accuracy of available meeting slot calculation by focusing on the schedule extraction and processing. This can be achieved by using more examples for schedule extraction to improve LLM accuracy. (Iteration 5)
*   Refine the time finding logic to prioritize finding *any* valid time first before considering preferences, then select a slot with the least constraint violations. Consider a weighted scoring for constraint violations. (Iteration 5)
*   Add a validation step where the generated meeting time is explicitly checked against all participants' schedules to confirm it doesn't conflict with any busy slots. (Iteration 5)
*   **Refine `find_meeting_time`:** Re-design the core algorithm to make available time finding more accurate. Ensure accurate reasoning about time intervals and constraints when listing potential time slots. Provide examples in the prompt. (Iteration 7)
*   **Enhance Schedule Parsing and Reasoning:** Develop better ways to handle schedule extraction. Experiment with different prompting techniques to ensure accurate calculations of all available time slots for each participant. (Iteration 7)
*   **Improve LLM constraint satisfaction:** Revise the prompting in `verify_meeting_time` to be more explicit about verifying that *all* constraints are met, including those related to preferences (e.g., "Adam would like to avoid more meetings on Wednesday after 12:30"). Make sure all constraints are being met. (Iteration 7)
*   **Evaluate Earliest Availability:** Add an explicit step to confirm that the chosen time is, in fact, the earliest possible. Perhaps a separate function or a prompt refinement to `verify_meeting_time`. (Iteration 7)
*   **Introduce Unit Tests:** Develop small, focused unit tests for schedule parsing and availability calculation to ensure the core logic functions correctly before full integration. (Iteration 7)
*   **Improve Constraint Extraction:** Refine the `extract_meeting_data` prompt to focus specifically on extracting *precise* blocked time slots for each participant and the requested meeting duration. Use few-shot examples that highlight potential ambiguities in the schedule descriptions and how to resolve them. Experiment with different extraction formats (e.g., JSON) to ensure structured output. (Iteration 4)
*   **Refine Schedule Processing:** Improve the `extract_data` and `check_constraints` agents to be more rigorous in processing schedules. The extraction of each participant's availability should be more deterministic rather than depending on the LLM's reasoning capabilities. One approach would be to convert schedule strings into a standardized, sortable format like a list of minutes. (Iteration 3)
*   **Verification of Extracted Data:** Enhance the `validate_extracted_data` stage with more rigorous checks. Specifically, it should verify that *all* blocked time slots are correctly identified and that the meeting duration is accurately represented. Add a feedback loop to `extract_meeting_data` if validation fails, to re-extract the information. (Iteration 4)
*   **Introduce Intermediate Verification:** Implement verification steps after the `extract_data` and `check_constraints` agents to confirm that the extracted data is accurate and complete *before* passing it to the `suggest_meeting_time` agent. If verifications fail, re-prompt with explicit feedback. (Iteration 3)
*   **Time Slot Representation:** Consider converting the extracted time slots into a more structured format (e.g., a list of boolean values representing 30-minute intervals) to facilitate easier constraint application in the `find_meeting_time` stage. This might require a Python function to convert textual time ranges to this format. (Iteration 4)
*   **Deterministic Slot Calculation:** Replace the LLM-based slot suggestion with a deterministic Python function that calculates the available time slots based on the extracted schedules. This function should take into account working hours, preferences, and meeting duration. (Iteration 3)
*   **Re-prompt the `find_meeting_time` component.** Create a prompt that asks the LLM to provide step-by-step reasoning about why it chose a particular time and to explicitly consider all stated constraints. Use the `validate_extracted_data` values to ensure all constraints are taken into account. (Iteration 4)
*   **Consider a ReAct approach in the `find_meeting_time` function** that can find a solution and adapt to constraint violations. (Iteration 5)
*   **Improve LLM Output Reliability:** Focus on improving the reliability of the LLM's output format.
    *   Instead of directly generating JSON, explore generating a more structured intermediate output format that can be deterministically parsed into JSON using code. (Iteration 0)
    *   Revise the prompt for `extract_meeting_details` to explicitly instruct the LLM to produce valid JSON. Include examples of the desired JSON output format and add specific formatting instructions (e.g., "Enclose the output in ```json ```"). (Iteration 0)
    *   Implement a verification loop with a `max_attempts` limit for LLM output. Re-prompt the LLM with specific feedback about parsing errors if the output is invalid JSON. This requires a refined prompt focusing on format correctness. (Iteration 0)
*   **Robust Schedule Parsing:** Focus on extracting *only* the schedules initially and use code to parse schedule descriptions. The core issue is extracting the schedules reliably. Explore regular expressions, natural language processing techniques, and other programmatic methods for parsing the schedule descriptions. (Iteration 0)
*   **Few-Shot Examples Adjustment:** Adapt the few-shot examples. Provide examples of schedules with overlaps and constraints to guide the agents. (Iteration 3)
*   **Consider a "best-of-n" approach within `find_meeting_time`:** Generate multiple candidate meeting times and then have the LLM evaluate each one against the constraints to select the best option. (Iteration 4)
*   **Re-evaluate Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Review the CoT prompting approach to determine if the step-by-step reasoning can be made more precise or if a more direct approach to constraint satisfaction is required. (Iteration 3)
*   **Constraint Prompting, Schema Definition, and Verification Loops:** Continue exploring constraint prompting, explicit schema definition, and verification loops as key adaptation strategies for this dataset and task. (Iteration 0)
*   **Consolidate Time Calculations:** Consider consolidating time-related calculations in a common module with clear unit handling to prevent future errors. (Iteration 2)
*   **Add Error Handling & Logging:** Add error handling and logging around LLM calls to capture failures more gracefully. (Iteration 2)
*   **Examine Chain-of-Thought Performance:** Once API connectivity is established, closely examine the performance of the chain-of-thought planning, extraction, and execution steps to assess their effectiveness. (Iteration 1)
*   Once time calculation is fixed, re-evaluate whether the verification LLM call is still needed. If the Python-based solution is accurate and incorporates all constraints, the LLM verification may be redundant. (Iteration 6)

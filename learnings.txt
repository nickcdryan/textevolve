# DATASET-SPECIFIC LEARNINGS & EXPERIMENT LOG

This document serves as a running log of our learnings, experiments, and findings specific to the question-answering task on this particular dataset of sports narratives and demographic data.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Passage Dependency:** Questions heavily reliant on the provided passage; external knowledge is rarely needed.
*   **Question Structure:** Questions consistently formatted as `PASSAGE:\n... \n\nQUESTION: ...`.
*   **Passage Content Variability:** Passages vary in content (sports - American Football, demographics, geography, nickel production, history, census data), length, and contain extraneous information. Requires differentiating between narrative descriptions and statistical data. Passages are generally self-contained snippets of text.
*   **Mixed Answer Types:** Questions require different answer formats: numerical values, proper nouns, and locations.
*   **Varied Question Complexity:** Questions range from simple fact retrieval to complex comparisons and calculations, often requiring multi-step reasoning.
*   **Dominant Topics:** Significant portion of questions related to sports (American Football specifically) and historical events, census and demographics. Questions often focus on scores and timing of events in sports games.
*   **Sports Game Summaries:** Passages often summarize sports games (likely American football), requiring model adaptability.
*   **Specific Factual Questions:** Many questions ask for specific factual details directly stated in the passage, such as player names, yardage, or point totals.
*   **Answer Types:** Typically concise and factual, directly extracted or derived from the passage, including proper nouns (player names, titles), numerical values (counts, yardage, rates, percentages), and dates. Expected answers are often concise.
*   **Question Types:**
    *   **Fact Extraction:** Directly retrieving information from the passage (e.g., "Who caught the final touchdown of the game?", "How many receiving yards...").
    *   **Counting/Aggregation:** Determining the number of occurrences of an event or entity (e.g., "How many running backs ran for a touchdown?", "How many total points were scored?"). Requires constraint awareness and accurate event tracking.
    *   **Calculation:** Performing arithmetic operations on values extracted from the passage (e.g., "How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?", "How many more housing units are there than households?"). Requires unit awareness.
    *   **Comparison/Difference:** Comparing values or entities described in the passage (e.g., "How many more TFR did Malays have in 2004 compared to Ethnic Chinese TFR in 2004?", "How many yards longer...", "Which player scored more field goals?"). Requires numerical reasoning.
    *   **Ordinality:** Questions may include ordinal terms like "second longest", requiring ranking and comparison.
    *   **Multiple Instances:** Question has multiple valid answers in the passage (e.g., "List all the countries...", "What touchdowns did Marc Bulger make?").
    *   **Score Tracking:** Questions that require tracking and aggregating scores based on individual plays or events described in the passage. Requires addition/subtraction of point values. "How many total points were scored?".
    *   **Implicit Numerical Reasoning:** Questions require *implicit* numerical reasoning or inference.
    *   **Temporal Reasoning:** Questions often involve temporal aspects, requiring understanding the sequence of events (e.g., "final touchdown," "first field goal"). Passages are often chronological. Involves calculating the duration between two events (e.g., "Was Peck in more films in the 1950s or 1960s?").
    *   **Complex Date/Event Identification:** Correctly pinpointing the exact start and end dates of events can be challenging due to varied phrasing and implied timelines.
    *   **Holistic Understanding for Final Score Calculation:** Some questions require a holistic understanding of the passage to determine the final score.
    *   **Role Identification:** Identifying roles or titles held by individuals, distinguishing between general and contextually specific roles (e.g., "Emir" vs. "Lord of Arabistan").
*   **Quantity-based Questions Dominate:** A significant portion of questions revolve around extracting numerical quantities and performing simple arithmetic. Example: "How many total passing touchdown yards did Dalton have?". Recent examples: "How many touchdown passes did Drew Brees throw that were less than 20 yards?", "Out of the Buccaneers first 4 games, how many had they lost?".
*   **Numerical Reasoning & Synthesis:** The questions often require multi-step numerical reasoning or combining multiple pieces of data from the text. Information is not always explicitly stated, requiring the model to make connections between different parts of the passage.
*   **Unit Sensitivity:** The presence of units of measurement (e.g., "yards," "percent," "months") is crucial for answer correctness. Unit Omission is a common failure mode. Questions often *imply* units (e.g., "How many months..." implies months).
*   **Precision Requirements:** Questions often require precise numerical answers. Precision Mismatch can occur.
*   **Synonyms and Paraphrasing:** The question might use different wording than the passage to refer to the same entity or event. Test robustness against paraphrasing.
*   **Multiple Occurrences:** An event (e.g., a touchdown) might occur multiple times; the question could be specific about which occurrence to consider (e.g., "first," "last," "second longest").
*   **Ambiguity in Expected Answer Granularity:** The "correctness" of an answer can be subjective. Example: providing "12 Dutch and 10 English" when the answer is expected to be "22".
*   **Explicit Information Assumption:** The questions assume the information needed to answer them is explicitly stated in the passage. Emphasis on direct information retrieval (named entities, numbers).
*   **Numerical Reasoning & Misdirection:** Questions frequently require numerical reasoning, often involving addition, subtraction, or comparison of numbers extracted from the provided text. The dataset also includes "trick" questions that introduce irrelevant entities.
*   **Complex Sentence Structure:** The passages often feature complex sentence structures.
*   **Entity Recognition and Coreference:** Questions frequently hinge on identifying specific entities (people, teams, locations) and resolving coreferences (pronouns referring back to those entities).
*   **Topic Variation:** Passages vary in topic (statistical data, filmographies, sports summaries), requiring adaptability from the model. Example: "How did Zhang enhance the economy?".
*   **Constraint-Based Questions:** Questions often include constraints on the type of events to count (e.g., "rushing touchdowns" vs. all touchdowns).
*   **Census-Style Data Passages:** A subset of the dataset includes census-style passages containing population statistics (number of people, households, families).
*   **Event-Based Questions with Dates:** Many questions are event-based, including dates. They require extracting numerical information tied to these events and then performing time-based calculations (e.g., years between events).
*   **Implicit Answers:** The answers are frequently embedded within longer sentences or clauses, requiring precise extraction rather than direct quoting.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** A common question type involves comparing numerical values or identifying the maximum/minimum of a property (e.g., longest distance, most frequent event). Examples: "Which player scored more field goals, Matt Stover or Phil Dawson?", "Which event happened first, the invasion Chugoku region or Battle of Sekigahara?".
*   **Ambiguous Temporal References**: Date and time references may be difficult to ground.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Multi-Stage Approach:** A multi-stage approach (question analysis, passage retrieval/extraction, answer generation, and verification) shows promise. Isolates errors and allows for targeted improvements. High accuracy (90% in Iteration 23, 1.0 in Iteration 28, 0.90 in Iteration 29, 80% in Iteration 30, 90% in Iteration 33) suggests breaking down the problem is effective. The current multi-stage chain-of-thought approach serves as a reasonable baseline. HOWEVER, Iteration 32 showed the basic implementation of a multi-stage design is insufficient without improvements to counting and conciseness. Despite the potential, iteration 34 showed that a multi-stage LLM approach with chain-of-thought prompting can have fundamental flaws.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting (LLM-focused):** Encouraging the LLM to explicitly show its reasoning steps can improve accuracy and allow for debugging.
*   **Example-Driven Reasoning (LLM-focused):** Providing the LLM with a few examples of questions and answers to guide its reasoning.
*   **Few-Shot Learning (LLM-focused):** Providing the LLM with a few examples of questions and answers to guide its reasoning. Few-shot examples in prompts can guide the LLMs to extract information, manipulate data, and derive answers.
*   **Answer Validation Prompt (LLM-focused):** Using a separate prompt to validate the generated answer, justifying its answer based on the passage. Important for questions that require calculations. `verify_answer` is an important step.
*   **Constrained Decoding (LLM-focused):** If the answer is known to be a number, use constrained decoding.
*   **Explicit Scoring Rule Definition:** Explicitly define the scoring rules for each type of play in prompt engineering.
*   **Leveraging Expert Roles:** Using LLMs with specific roles (question analyzer, passage extractor, etc.) helps to modularize the reasoning process. When guided with specific system instructions ("expert roles"), the LLM can effectively perform question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and verification.
*   **Keyword-Based Passage Extraction:** Using keywords from the question to extract relevant passages works well for narrowing down the information scope.
*   **Focused Passage Extraction:** Extracting only the most relevant portions of the passage helps to reduce noise and computational load.
*   **Error Handling:** Explicitly incorporating error handling within the code ensures that the system gracefully manages unexpected situations.
*   **Numerical Reasoning:** Numerical reasoning is crucial for questions that require the understanding of proportions or percentages, and extraction of numerical answers from a complex context.
*   **Overall Architecture Sound:** The architecture of question analysis, extraction, generation, and verification offers potential.
*   **Specialized LLM Agents:** Specialized agents with specific system instructions helps focus the LLM's reasoning at each stage.
*   **Modularity of Agents:** Using separate agents for each stage (question analyzer, passage extractor, answer generator, and answer verifier) helps to modularize the reasoning process and allows for targeted improvements in each stage.
*   **Specificity Identification:** Identifying the required granularity or specificity of the information being requested (e.g., general title vs. specific title).
*   **Effective Question Analysis:** The `analyze_question` step effectively guides subsequent steps in most cases.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Arithmetic Errors:** The system demonstrably fails at basic arithmetic. For example, incorrectly counts touchdown passes in one instance (actual "4", expected "3"). LLM consistently fails when arithmetic operations are required to derive the correct answer (addition, subtraction, etc.). "How many more housing units are there than households?". LLM correctly identifies the touchdown but fails to calculate the total points for the fourth quarter, even when knowing the point value of a touchdown. The LLM is strong at synthesizing a single answer, but not with performing multi-step logic or arithmetic.
*   **Incorrect Counting/Aggregation:** Even when the extraction is mostly correct, the final aggregation or counting step is often wrong. The example of Drew Brees' touchdown passes highlights this issue directly. The system struggles to accurately count specific events (e.g., rushing touchdowns) when the question requires distinguishing between different types of the same event (e.g., rushing vs. passing touchdowns). The system fails to accurately count touchdowns passes in one instance (actual "4", expected "3").
*   **Comparative Reasoning Errors:** Even when extracting the correct numerical data points for a comparative question, the system sometimes fails to make the correct comparison. As seen in the 'Stover vs. Dawson' example, the system provided correct field goal counts but chose the wrong player. The system sometimes fails to make the correct comparison (Stover vs. Dawson).
*   **Answer Extraction Failure:** The system correctly verifies that the answer is present within its intermediate representation but fails to output the *answer itself*, instead providing a "Verification: Correct" signal. This suggests a problem with the final stage of answer extraction from internal data structures. For example, with the question "From what distance were two touchdowns runs scored from?" and the expected answer "1-yard", the model verifies it *can* get the answer, but doesn't actually print it to the user. The multi-stage approach can successfully isolate and verify correct answers internally, but fails to output the *answer itself*, instead providing a "Verification: Correct" signal.
*   **Incomplete Answer Synthesis:** The system extracts *some* relevant information but fails to synthesize a *complete* and comprehensive answer to the question. Example: The question "What yard line did both teams score from?" expected "1-yard" but the system answered "1-yard and 8-yard lines," including extraneous information.
*   **Boundary Confusion:** The model seems to confuse the boundaries between what it can extract and what is necessary for a perfect answer. The model is not adept at taking the relevant extractions and trimming the fat to adhere to the answer found in the golden file.
*   **Numerical Reasoning Errors:** The system struggles with questions that require inference, comparison beyond single sentence lookup, or multi-step calculations. The system can extract numbers, but fails to reason about them. Example: Calculating 51.0% - 47.2% incorrectly.
*   **Inference and Synthesis:** The system struggles when the answer isn't directly stated but requires inference or synthesis of information from different parts of the passage. For example, calculating the total points scored in a game ("How many total points were scored?") requires summing the scores mentioned for each team.
*   **Incorrect Answer Type Handling:** The system frequently fails to identify the correct answer type. For example, instead of providing a numerical answer to a "How many..." question, it returns a verification status ("Correct").
*   **Over-reliance on Verification:** The system seems to prematurely stop at verification, without extracting the specific answer from the extracted passage. This leads to responses like "True" or "Correct" when a more detailed answer is required.
*   **Passage Understanding Deficiencies:** While the passages contain the answer, the system struggles to extract the correct information, even when it correctly identifies the relevant passage.
*   **Incomplete Numerical Extraction:** The system struggles to extract *all* relevant numbers required for calculations.
*   **Difficulty in Combining Numerical Data:** The system fails to correlate and aggregate information across the passage (e.g., "How many touchdown runs were made for the same yardage?").
*   **Missing Implicit Information:** Errors occur when the model fails to recognize and use implicit information.
*   **Confusion Between Implied and Explicit Information:** Difficulty with deriving at the right answer when implied by the text. *Example*: LLM assumes the Giants scored 0 points in the third quarter, when in reality they didn't.
*   **Incorrect Date Identification:** The system struggles to consistently identify the correct start and end dates for calculating time differences.
*   **Inaccurate Handling of Ordinality:** Inability to correctly answer questions involving ordinality (e.g., "second longest").
*   **Precision Mismatch:** Providing a range when a precise answer is expected is a frequent failure mode.
*   **Failure to Extract All Relevant Instances:** The system sometimes fails to identify all instances of events related to the question.
*   **Inability to Filter Extraneous Information:** Difficulty in filtering out irrelevant details from the passage.
*   **Missing Numerical Aggregation:** The system fails when questions require combining multiple numbers from the passage into a single answer. Example: "How many Dutch and English warships were blocking Spanish support?" expects the sum of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships (22), but the system returns "12 Dutch and 10 English".
*   **Lack of Calculation Awareness and Execution:** The system is not reliably detecting the need for any calculation. Example: "How many in percent from the census weren't African American?" requires subtracting the percentage of African Americans from 100%, but the system fails to perform this operation and gives 2.8% instead of 97.2%.
*   **Ambiguity Resolution:** Difficulty in disambiguating similar information or names within the passage.
*   **Incomplete Information Inference:** Failing to correctly infer the answer when it requires synthesizing information from multiple parts of the passage.
*   **Misinterpreting Data:** The system misinterpreted the question "How many total points were scored in the game?".
*   **Temporal Reasoning Errors:** The system struggles with precise temporal calculations, particularly when dealing with months and approximate time phrases (e.g., "roughly").
*   **Semantic Equivalence Failure:** The system fails to understand that the golden answer, a number, is semantically different from a quantity like "one month".
*   **Incorrect Information Extraction:** The system sometimes extracts and provides incorrect or unrelated pieces of information from the passage. The extraction process should be audited to verify its fidelity. The LLM may be extracting related, but not directly responsive, information from the passage.
*   **Inaccurate Question Analysis:** Incorrectly identifying the question type leads to extracting irrelevant information and generating wrong answers.
*   **Inability to Handle Temporal Reasoning:** The system struggles with questions requiring temporal reasoning or comparison, such as "Which happened later..." questions.
*   **Unit Omission:** The most prominent failure mode is the omission of units of measurement in the answer. Even if the numerical value is correct, the absence of the correct unit leads to a mismatch with the expected answer (e.g., "77 and 1" instead of "1-yard, 77-yard").
*   **Incorrect Ordering of Answer Components:** When multiple pieces of information are required in the answer, the system sometimes provides them in the wrong order.
*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** Demonstrates a lack of robust contextual understanding leading to formatting errors.
*   **Misdirection and Contextual Errors:** The system fails to correctly interpret the context and is easily misled by irrelevant information. *Example:* The question asking about "the Suns".
*   **Entity Confusion:** The system struggles to correctly link information to the correct entity when multiple entities are mentioned in the passage. *Example:* Questions about which group in the census is larger.
*   **Negation Interpretation:** The system struggles with questions involving negation (e.g., "How many percent are not non-families?"). It fails to correctly subtract the negated quantity from the whole.
*   **Contextual Numerical Extraction:** The system incorrectly identifies numbers due to a failure to determine context.
*   **Lack of Precise Understanding of Question Constraints:** The system struggles to incorporate the full constraints of the question. In the "rushing touchdowns" example, the system apparently counted *all* touchdowns instead of *only* rushing touchdowns.
*   **Lack of Numerical Synthesis:** The system struggles to synthesize numerical information presented in different forms within the passage (e.g., combining multiple percentage values to reach a total).
*   **Inability to Perform Basic Calculations:** The primary failure mode is the system's inability to perform basic arithmetic operations, particularly addition and subtraction, necessary to derive answers from the passage.
*   **Misinterpreting Expected Output Format:** The system can correctly extract the necessary numbers but fails when the question requires combining them into a single aggregated answer (e.g., summing multiple counts when the desired answer is a single total).
*   **Lack of Explicit Aggregation Logic:** The system lacks explicit instructions or constraints on how to combine or aggregate the extracted numerical information, especially when a single number is expected as the golden answer.
*   **Inadequate Question Analysis for Aggregation:** The `analyze_question` function doesn't reliably identify the need for aggregation or calculation when the question implicitly requires it.
*   **Contextual Misunderstanding:** The system may misunderstand the context of the question, leading to extraction of irrelevant information or incorrect calculations, especially if the question contains implicit references or requires understanding relationships between entities (e.g., understanding the "game" refers to the one in the passage).
*   **Incorrect Entity Association:** The system misinterprets the scope or target of the percentage, linking a numerical value to the wrong subject (e.g., Haiti's international commerce vs. Hispaniola).
*   **Reliance on Keyword Matching:** The system relies too heavily on keywords (e.g., "percent") without properly understanding the precise entity to which that value applies.
*   **Insufficient Contextual Reasoning:** The system struggles with drawing inferences and understanding implied relationships within the passage. Model seems to have trouble with multi-step reasoning, especially when arithmetic is involved.
*   **Synonym Usage:** Potential failure to extract passage or identify correct answer if the question and the passage contains different vocabularies although they mean the same.
*   **Verification Stage Ineffectiveness:** The verification stage may not be effective to the point of correcting numerical reasoning errors.
*   **Misinterpreting Negation:** The model fails when questions involve negation, providing the opposite of the correct answer (e.g., percentage of families instead of non-families). Highlights a flaw in the question analysis stage.
*   **Incorrect Event Association:** The model may fail to correctly connect an event from the passage with the required entity, suggesting extraction of the first encountered value instead of considering all possibilities (e.g., longest run for a touchdown).
*   **Lack of contextual awareness**: The example about the longest run suggests a failure to identify all touchdown runs from different players in the passage before selecting the longest.
*   **Complex Reasoning Failure:** Inability to perform complex reasoning, such as aggregating information, comparing values, or performing simple arithmetic.
*   **Hallucination:** The LLM invents an answer not supported by the provided text.
    *   **Title/Role Specificity:** Failing to prioritize contextually specific information over general information when answering title/role-based questions (e.g., answering "Emir" when "Lord of Arabistan" is more accurate).
    *   **Verbose/Non-Concise Answers:** The agent provides full sentences instead of the concise answers expected by the evaluation criteria. The model includes extraneous information that impacts semantic equivalence. For example, it provided the counts for each player instead of just naming the player with more field goals.
    *   **Comparative Analysis Failure:** Failing to perform explicit numerical comparison to determine a maximum value (e.g., incorrectly identifying the player with the longest touchdown play due to a lack of yardage comparison).

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **2025-05-19 14:27:04 - INITIAL DATASET ANALYSIS:** Comprehensive analysis of dataset characteristics, challenges, potential approaches, and implementation recommendations.
*   **ITERATION 0:** Initial multi-stage approach achieved 67% accuracy. Highlighted the need for improved handling of questions involving comparisons and ordinality. The system needs mechanisms for systematically extracting and processing multiple instances of events from the passage.
*   **ITERATION 1:** Achieved 1.0 accuracy using a multi-stage LLM approach with chain-of-thought prompting. Proved highly effective for the tested subset of the dataset.
*   **ITERATION 2:** Achieved 1.0 accuracy using a multi-stage LLM approach with example-driven reasoning. The modular approach is effective.
*   **ITERATION 3:** The multi-stage LLM approach struggles with questions that necessitate any form of numerical calculation or aggregation, even when the component numbers are correctly extracted from the passage. The system also exhibited a tendency to answer "The answer is correct" instead of providing the actual answer.
*   **ITERATION 4:** The initial hypothesis that a multi-stage LLM approach can effectively answer questions based on text passages is partially confirmed. The system achieves high accuracy on simpler questions but fails when arithmetic reasoning is involved (90% accuracy on simpler questions). Rejected the hypothesis that the current multi-stage approach is sufficient for all types of questions, as demonstrated by the failure to handle questions requiring score tracking and comparison.
*   **ITERATION 5:** The "exploitation" strategy does not adequately address the specific challenges of temporal reasoning and arithmetic calculation present in this dataset. The 80% accuracy indicates a ceiling is being reached with the current approach.
*   **ITERATION 6:** The multi-stage LLM approach shows promise in decomposing the problem but needs to be augmented with a dedicated arithmetic reasoning component to solve quantitative questions. Errors occur primarily in the "generate" and "verify" stages due to the lack of arithmetic capability.
*   **ITERATION 7:** Rejected the hypothesis that a multi-stage LLM approach with question analysis and answer verification would be sufficient for this dataset. The 40% accuracy indicates that the current implementation needs significant improvements. The system struggles with correct answer type identification, and prematurely stops at verification, without extracting the specific answer from the extracted passage. Passage understanding also remains deficient. The question analysis stage is likely a bottleneck.
*   **ITERATION 8:** The multi-stage approach shows promise (70% accuracy), but the LLM's inherent limitations in precise numerical reasoning and information extraction are the bottleneck.
*   **ITERATION 9:** Achieved 1.00 accuracy using a multi-stage approach. The system's ability to handle quantitative reasoning, as demonstrated by the sports question (calculating the difference in yards), is crucial for this dataset. `verify_answer` is an important step. The success indicates that the LLM, when guided with specific system instructions ("expert roles"), can effectively perform question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and verification.
*   **ITERATION 10:** Accuracy of 0.70. The use of multiple LLM-based verifiers is not sufficient to overcome the temporal reasoning weaknesses. The iterative refinement approach doesn't appear to adequately address the challenges posed by time-related questions in this dataset. The experiment highlights that while LLMs can extract facts, accurately calculating durations and dealing with nuances of time requires more specialized processing or fine-tuning.
*   **ITERATION 11:** Accuracy of 0.70. The results highlight that while the overall architecture of the system is reasonable, the individual components, particularly the answer generation and verification steps, need improvement. The reliance on LLMs for arithmetic and logical reasoning is a weak point.
*   **ITERATION 12:** Results highlight the need for explicit unit handling in both answer generation and verification. The single run underscores the LLM's struggle with output formatting (unit omission and incorrect ordering) and the limitations of the current verification stage in correcting these issues.
*   **ITERATION 13:** The Exploitation strategy highlights the limitations of the LLM in performing arithmetic and complex reasoning tasks directly. The initial question analysis and focused passage extraction are promising steps, but the LLM needs additional support for accurate calculation and contextual awareness.
*   **ITERATION 14:** Accuracy of 80%. The "Exploitation" strategy has revealed critical weaknesses in handling numerical reasoning and negated queries within this specific dataset. Confirms the potential of a multi-stage approach, but rejects the sufficiency of the current implementation.
*   **ITERATION 15:** Achieved 1.00 accuracy using a multi-stage LLM-driven approach with chain-of-thought reasoning. The decomposition into question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and verification, with specialized agents for each function, proved highly effective. Explicit error handling also contributed to the success.
*   **ITERATION 16:** Exploitation strategy, achieving 80% accuracy, reveals a critical weakness in precise counting and contextual understanding, especially for sports narratives and event-based questions. The "Calculation Needed" flag indicates the system recognizes the need for some form of numerical reasoning, but the subsequent calculation is often incorrect, and the verification stage is not robust enough to catch miscounting errors.
*   **ITERATION 17:** Reported 1.00 accuracy using a multi-stage approach. While promising, this result is questionable due to the lack of reported error cases. A 1.0 accuracy claim without supporting error analysis is unreliable. Further validation with comprehensive error logging is required. This iteration highlights the *critical importance* of tracking and analyzing failure modes to accurately assess system performance.
*   **ITERATION 18:** Hypothesis Rejected: The initial hypothesis that the multi-stage LLM approach could effectively handle quantitative reasoning based on the provided passages was rejected. The system demonstrated a significant weakness in performing even simple calculations. The experiment highlighted a key limitation of the LLM in its current configuration: a lack of capacity for basic numerical processing and synthesis, even when provided with all the necessary information within the passage.
*   **ITERATION 19:** Multi-stage approach yields 70% accuracy. The system demonstrates limitations in numerical reasoning (failing to perform subtractions) and inference (failing to synthesize information from different parts of the passage). Highlights that the system extracts information well, but struggles to process it.
*   **ITERATION 20:** The multi-stage approach has potential, but the "verify\_answer" stage is not robust enough to handle cases where aggregation or calculation is necessary.
*   **ITERATION 21:** Perfect accuracy on simple extraction tasks shows the multi-stage approach is effective when questions are relatively straightforward and require minimal reasoning or inference. The analysis points out that the most critical problem is the shallow reasoning and limited contextual understanding.
*   **ITERATION 22:** Achieved 80% accuracy. Primary failure is misinterpreting the scope of percentages and linking values to the wrong subject, showing weakness in semantic understanding and entity resolution.
*   **ITERATION 23:** Exploitation strategy, leveraging the multi-stage LLM approach, achieves a strong baseline (90% accuracy). Analysis confirms the modular approach to question answering can be effective, but highlights need for improvements in the final reasoning/calculation stage.
*   **ITERATION 24:** Achieved perfect accuracy (1.00) using a multi-stage LLM with chain-of-thought prompting. Due to the perfect accuracy, specific failure modes cannot be identified.
*   **ITERATION 25:** The exploitation strategy achieved an accuracy of 80%, indicating a good baseline for the performance of the approach. The primary issue lies in numerical reasoning and semantic understanding rather than the overall architecture of the chain-of-thought approach. Verification stage may not be effective to the point of correcting numerical reasoning errors.
*   **ITERATION 26:** The exploitation strategy achieved an accuracy of 80%, further solidifying this architecture's potential. However, key weaknesses persist in negation handling, event association, and contextual reasoning. The multi-stage approach is promising but sensitive to errors in the question analysis stage, which then propagate through the subsequent stages.
*   **ITERATION 27:** Multi-stage approach with specialized agents shows potential but struggles with complex reasoning (aggregation, comparison, arithmetic) and contextual grounding. The implementation is insufficient for complex reasoning.
*   **ITERATION 28:** Multi-stage LLM approach with chain-of-thought reasoning achieves 1.0 accuracy. Confirms effectiveness but highlights need for further testing with more complex and diverse examples, and implementation of robust error logging. Perfect accuracy suggests potential overfitting or insufficiently challenging test set.
*   **ITERATION 29:** Achieved 0.90 accuracy with the multi-stage LLM approach. The primary failure mode is incomplete answer synthesis where the system extracts some relevant information but fails to generate a complete answer. This highlights the need for refinement in the answer generation stage.
*   **ITERATION 30:** The exploitation strategy achieved an accuracy of 80%, indicating a solid base level of performance. The single identified failure case reveals a critical limitation: the system's inability to prioritize contextually specific information over general information when answering title/role-based questions.
*   **ITERATION 31:** The multi-stage approach can successfully isolate and verify correct answers internally, but fails to output the *answer itself*, instead providing a "Verification: Correct" signal. This is a final-stage extraction problem. Example: With the question "From what distance were two touchdowns runs scored from?" and the expected answer "1-yard", the model verifies it *can* get the answer, but doesn't actually print it to the user. Hypothesis rejected: a simple sequential LLM pipeline is insufficient for answer extraction.
*   **ITERATION 32:** Multi-stage approach yields 60% accuracy. Fails at accurate counting/aggregation, generates verbose/non-concise answers, and sometimes omits the numerical answer despite affirming correctness. Rejects the hypothesis that the current implementation improves accuracy and LLM answer generation.
*   **ITERATION 33:** Multi-stage approach yields 90% accuracy. Fails when a question requires comparative analysis to determine a maximum value (e.g., longest touchdown play).
*   **ITERATION 34:** Multi-stage LLM approach achieves 20% accuracy. Demonstrates arithmetic errors (incorrect touchdown counts), incorrect counting/aggregation, and comparative reasoning errors. Hypothesis rejected: A multi-stage LLM approach with chain-of-thought prompting is insufficient. The LLM appears to be strong at synthesizing a single answer, but not with performing multi-step logic or arithmetic.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Implement External Calculator/Counter:** Replace the LLM's arithmetic calculations with calls to an external, reliable calculator or counting function. This ensures accurate numerical processing after information extraction.
*   **Explicit Comparison Step:** For comparative questions, add an explicit comparison step that uses the extracted information and the external calculator to determine the correct answer based on numerical values.
*   **Fine-tune Extraction Stage:** Create a more targeted extraction stage. It's possible the LLM is extracting related, but not directly responsive, information from the passage. This can be validated by auditing the extraction prompts and results.
*   **Verify Reasoning Trace:** Focus on making the LLM provide a verifiable trace of its reasoning. Asking it to provide a "step-by-step" explanation of how it arrived at its answer is not enough; it needs to show its work, including the specific text snippets it used and the calculations it performed.
*   **Explicit Temporal Tagging:** Implement a stage that tags each event/fact in the passage with explicit temporal information (if present). This will help the system to ground the events to real or relative times.
*   **Focus on Comparative Analysis:** Implement a numerical comparison module within the `generate_answer` or `verify_answer` stage to handle questions requiring comparison of numerical values (e.g., longest, shortest, most, least).
    *   The system should extract the relevant numerical values from the passage, perform the comparison operation (e.g., find the maximum), and generate an answer based on the comparison result.
    *   Specifically, for questions asking "Which player had the longest touchdown play of the game?", the system should extract all touchdown plays and their yardages, compare the yardages, and return the player associated with the highest yardage.
    *   Consider adding unit tests specifically designed to test the system's ability to perform numerical comparisons.
*   **Focus on Answer Extraction:** Revise the `verify_answer` or a subsequent stage to ensure the *actual* extracted answer is returned as the final output, rather than just a verification signal. The most important part of this approach is extracting the actual verified answer that the model seems to already have.
*   **Debug the Final Stage:** Isolate and debug the final stage of the pipeline to determine why the answer is not being extracted and returned correctly.
*   **Enforce Concise Answer Generation:** Modify the prompt in the answer generation and verification stages to explicitly instruct the LLM to provide only the most essential information required to answer the question. For example, if the answer is a name, the prompt should say "Output only the name". If the answer is a number, the prompt should say "Output only the number".
*   **Post-Processing for Numerical Output:** Implement a post-processing step that checks for numerical answers and extracts the number, ensuring that *only* the numerical answer is returned when expected.
*   **Refine Answer Generation:** Focus on improving the answer generation stage by incorporating techniques to ensure completeness and accuracy. Include a post-processing step that filters the generated answer based on the question, using regular expressions or other text processing techniques to remove extraneous information. Focus on improving question understanding so the model can correctly interpret questions and determine which information needs extraction.
*   **Enhance Reasoning Capabilities:** Augment the "answer generator" agent with capabilities for performing calculations and comparisons. Implement a calculator module to perform arithmetic operations instead of relying on the LLM. Fine tune or prompt engineer the individual LLM agents to become more confident in their individual roles.
*   **Improve Counting/Aggregation Accuracy:** Refine the passage extraction and answer generation stages to ensure accurate counting and aggregation of events. Consider prompting strategies that explicitly emphasize the need for accurate counting. For example, prime the LLM with examples of correct counting from similar passages, or use a separate counting module that post-processes extracted information.
*   **Focus Verification on Numerical Accuracy:** Refine the verification stage to specifically check the numerical accuracy of the generated answer. This may involve comparing the generated answer to multiple extractions from the text or using a rule-based system to cross-validate the LLM's reasoning.
*   **Improve Question Analysis:** Refine the "question analyzer" to better identify question types that require specific reasoning skills (counting, comparison, arithmetic). Enhance the `analyze_question` function to better identify question types that require calculations or inferences and to identify and encode constraints within the question. Improve aggregation/calculation detection. Enhance

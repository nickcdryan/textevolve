## DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Contextual Passage:** Every question is accompanied by a passage of text (sports, news, astronomy, census data). Answers must be textually derived, potentially with *external knowledge.*
*   **Reasoning over Text:** Requires reasoning over provided text; answers derive from numerical/comparative analysis within the text.
*   **Fact-Based:** Questions are primarily fact-based, requiring specific information extraction (direct or indirect).
*   **Varied Question Types:** Questions vary (who, what, how many, etc.) and cover diverse topics (player names, scores, stellar masses, population statistics).
*   **Implicit Relationships:** Understanding relationships between events/entities is often necessary.
*   **Numerical Reasoning:** Questions frequently require numerical reasoning and comparison.
    *   Extract multiple numerical values and perform arithmetic (addition, subtraction, comparison) to arrive at the correct answer. (e.g., score differences)
*   **Numerical & Temporal Reasoning:** Requires precise numerical and temporal reasoning from the text (dates, numbers, arithmetic/comparisons).
*   **Percentage Calculation:** Calculating percentages based on passage information is common.
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Comparing numerical values or identifying max/min values is prevalent (e.g., "longest touchdown," "more sacks vs. fumbles").
*   **Temporal Reasoning:** Temporal reasoning/comparison ("What happened second...") requires parsing the passage for chronological order.
*   **Quantitative Reasoning:** Many questions require numerical answers ("How many points...").
*   **Short Answers:** Answers are typically short, concise phrases or numerical values.
*   **Directly Extractable:** Many answers are directly present, but may need minimal processing/inference.
*   **Consistency in Format:** Expected answer format is usually a string or a number.
*   **Context-Dependent:** Answer meaning is entirely passage-dependent.
*   **Domain Knowledge:**
    *   General Knowledge is assumed.
    *   Sports (American Football): Basic terminology understanding is crucial.
    *   Astronomy: Basic astronomy knowledge (stars, mass).
    *   Basic Arithmetic is needed.
    *   Units: Understanding units being used is necessary (yards, points, solar masses).
*   **Historical Context & Reasoning:** Requires reasoning about historical figures/events beyond the passage.
*   **Multi-Sentence Synthesis:** Answering frequently requires synthesizing information from multiple sentences.
*   **Combination of Explicit and Implicit Information:** Questions often require combining explicit passage information with common-sense/world knowledge.
*   **Question Types:**
    *   Extraction: Directly extracting information (e.g., "Who caught the final touchdown?"). "Which star has a smaller mass, Nu Phoenicis or Gliese 915?"
    *   Counting: Counting occurrences of entities/events (e.g., "How many running backs ran for a touchdown?").
    *   Comparison: Comparing numerical values (e.g., "How many yards longer was Sebastian Janikowski's first field goal compared to his second?"). "Which star has a smaller mass, Nu Phoenicis or Gliese 915?"
    *   Identification: Identifying a specific agent/object. (e.g., "Who threw the second longest touchdown pass?")
    *   Seeking Specifics: Example: "Which player kicked the only field goal of the game?".
*   **Reasoning Types:**
    *   Direct Extraction: Locating the relevant sentence and extracting the answer verbatim.
    *   Simple Inference: Combining information from multiple sentences/clauses.
    *   Numerical Reasoning: Performing arithmetic operations based on passage data.

*   **Multiple Dates & Numbers:** Passages often contain multiple dates/numbers.
*   **Passage Length Variation:** Passages vary in length, but relevant information is often spread throughout the text.
*   **Identifying Details:** Many questions involve identifying specific details within a narrative or chronological context (e.g., "Which quarter did X happen?", "How many Y until Z?").
*   **Broad Knowledge Comprehension:** The passages cover a range of topics, including history, sports, and events, requiring broad knowledge comprehension.
*   **Arithmetic Reasoning Requirement:** A significant portion of questions require arithmetic reasoning (especially subtraction) to derive the answer, even when the relevant numbers are explicitly stated in the passage.
*   **Demographic Data:** The dataset contains census-style information, leading to questions about percentages and population statistics.
*   **Sports Game Summaries:** A notable portion of the dataset includes summaries of sports games, with questions focusing on scores, point differences, and records.

## EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Multi-Agent Debate:** (Accuracy 1.0 in Iteration 7) Iterative proposal and critique mechanism is robust for extracting correct answers. Structured question format works well with debate, allowing agents to verify components of the solution.
*   **Keyword Matching and Extraction:** Identify keywords, search for sentences, and extract relevant information.
*   **Question Type Classification:** Classify question type (extraction, counting, comparison, calculation) and use a specialized approach.
*   **Sentence Similarity:** Calculate similarity between question and passage sentences, and extract the answer.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Prompt the LLM to explain its reasoning process step-by-step.
*   **Decomposition:** Break down complex questions into simpler sub-questions.
    *   **Numerical Questions:** Identify numbers, determine operation, calculate, present result.
    *   **Who/What/Which Questions:** Identify entity/event, locate sentences, extract information.
    *   *Note:* Effectiveness depends on extraction accuracy for each sub-question. Error propagation is possible. Decompose numerical questions into steps that isolate values, then compute.
*   **Prompt Engineering for Conciseness:** Instruct LLM to provide only the single most relevant entity/phrase (e.g., "Answer with only the name").
*   **Post-Processing:** Extract the core entity from the LLM's response (NER, string manipulation).
*   **Few-shot examples:** Incorporate few-shot examples demonstrating the desired concise answer format.
*   **Fact Verification using Retrieval System:** Add a retrieval system for verifying facts and entities. Fact verification helps improve accuracy, especially when passage lacks details. Direct fact-verification to validate extracted numerical values and calculation steps.
*   **Passage Structure Awareness:** Use passage structure (e.g., sports reports: quarter-by-quarter summary) to focus search.
*   **Question Focus:** Answers related to a player are often near the first mention of that player.
*   **Predefined Answer Lists:** For certain question types (e.g., "Which team won?"), select from a predefined list.
*   **Negative Constraints:** Generate negative constraints (e.g., "Who *wasn't* playing?") and eliminate those.
*   **Multi-Stage LLM Approach:** Simplification, Extraction, and Verification allows for modularity, error diagnosis, and iterative refinement.
*   **Hybrid Approach (Simplification, Extraction, Verification):** Effective for extracting numerical information.
*   **Explicit Association of Values and Descriptors**: Request LLM to explicitly associate values with their descriptors (e.g., "Longest touchdown pass: [value]").
*   **Answer Checker Agent:** Explicitly instruct the "answer checker" to verify numbers are relevant.
*   **Dedicated System Instructions for Modularity:** Using different system instructions for decomposition, answering, and synthesis *could* be effective if each module performed its specific task accurately.
*   **Prompt Engineering for Extraction:** Experiment with prompts to elicit accurate numerical and temporal values (e.g., "Extract date of X in YYYY-MM-DD").
*   **Few-Shot Examples for Extraction:** Provide few-shot examples demonstrating precise extraction of dates and numbers.
*   **Self-Correction:** Helps catch and fix mistakes.
*   **External Knowledge Retrieval & Integration (Proposed):** Augment system to retrieve external knowledge when LLM determines it is necessary. Integrate retrieved knowledge with passage before final validation. Refine prompts to utilize both passage and external knowledge. Cite the source.
*   **`call_llm` wrapper:** Effective for consistent LM invocation (Iteration 7).
*   **Simplify the problem:** Remove validation steps that are clearly not helping accuracy and focus on getting the core answer generation correct. Then, reintroduce validation steps one at a time.
*   **Direct Subtraction Implementation:** Replace the LLM-based subtraction with a reliable, deterministic calculation by extracting numbers and performing the subtraction directly in the code.
*   **Score Tracking for Sports Games:** Explicitly track the scores of each team as the game progresses, based on the information in the passage, when the question relates to a sports game. This would allow for answering questions about the winner, point differences, etc.

*   **Ineffective Strategies:**
    *   **Simple Query-and-Synthesize Approach:** *Not* effective for this dataset.
    *   **Multi-Stage LLM-Driven Fact Verification and Information Extraction Alone:** *Not* sufficient when external knowledge is required.
    *   **Question Decomposition Alone (with LLM Arithmetic):** The current implementation of question decomposition, followed by LLM arithmetic, does *not* improve performance on questions requiring subtraction or other basic arithmetic.

## COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Units Conversion:** (Not present in examples, but potential).
*   **Time Sensitivity:** Understanding relative time references (e.g., "later on").
*   **Overly Verbose Answers:** LLM includes unnecessary context. (e.g., "Gliese 915 has a smaller mass than Nu Phoenicis" instead of "Gliese 915").
*   **Incorrect Entity Identification:** LLM identifies the wrong entity. (e.g., answering "Joe Flacco" instead of "Brett Favre").
*   **Lack of Precise Information Retrieval:** Fails to extract correctly, even when identified in the passage.
*   **Numerical Reasoning Errors:** Incorrect calculations or misinterpretation of numerical information.
*   **Incorrect Numerical Extraction:** Inaccurate extraction of numerical values, especially within narratives. May pick any mentioned number, not the relevant one.
*   **Inaccurate Numerical/Temporal Extraction:** Inability to accurately extract dates and numerical values. Even one error derails reasoning.
*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** Fails to associate values with descriptors (e.g., "80" with "touchdown pass").
*   **Complex Reasoning:** Struggles with multi-step reasoning or aggregating information.
*   **Ambiguous Questions:** Misinterprets question, extracting incorrect information.
*   **Failure to Filter Irrelevant Information:** Fails to identify relevant pieces.
*   **Error Propagation:** Incorrect information extraction propagates through steps.

*   **Over-Elaboration and Misinterpretation:** Provides more information than necessary.
*   **Entity Confusion and Misidentification:** Confuses entities due to semantic understanding issues.
*   **Inability to perform basic arithmetical reasoning:** Unable to accurately subtract.
        *   Example: When asked "How many is the difference in the yards of the first field goal made by Brown and the TD run by Jackson?" (39 and 7 respectively), it reported "I am missing the critical step of calculating the difference between these two values to answer the original question."
*   **External Knowledge Dependence Failure:** Inability to leverage external knowledge (fact verification limited to context window).
*   **Lack of External Knowledge Integration:** Fails to integrate external knowledge needed for reasoning.
*   **Counting Errors:** Struggles with accurately counting entities or events mentioned in the passage. Example: Failing to identify the correct number of dynasties.
*   **Temporal Misidentification:** Incorrectly identifies when events occur within a passage. Example: Confusing the order of scoring in a game and failing to identify the correct quarter.
*   **Limited Reasoning:** Fails when questions require even a minimal level of inference or deduction beyond direct extraction. The system seems to rely on keyword matching and struggles to understand the relationships between different parts of the passage.
*   **Inability to Synthesize Information:** The model struggles to synthesize information to deduce a final answer. For example, in the Bengals/Broncos example, it could not determine the winner even with information on scoring plays.
*   **False Claims of Missing Information:** In some cases, the model incorrectly claims information is missing when it is, in fact, present in the passage. For example, when asked to calculate percentages the model states "Since the sub-question answers indicate that the provided text is missing, it's impossible to answer the original question."
*   **Subtraction Errors:** The system consistently fails when subtraction is required. The model claims it can't calculate the difference even when it has correctly identified the two relevant numbers.

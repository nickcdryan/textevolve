## Knowledge Synthesis: Iteration 3

This document synthesizes learnings from Iteration 0, Iteration 1, Iteration 2, and Iteration 3, focusing on insights specific to the meeting scheduling dataset.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   **Structured Text with Constraints:** The questions are presented in a structured text format. This includes participant names, a defined work hour window, potential meeting days (single day: Monday in latest batches), and explicit schedule constraints for each participant. The prompt provides a task description with example solutions. The questions follow a consistent structure: an introductory prompt defining the task, followed by a `TASK` section detailing participants, meeting duration, and scheduling constraints. Finally, a `SOLUTION` section expects the proposed meeting time. (Identified in Iteration 1, Iteration 3)
*   Questions follow a consistent structure: a preamble about the system being an "expert at scheduling meetings," followed by a TASK definition outlining participants, duration, and time constraints. This is succeeded by a schedule for each participant, and concluded with a request to "Find a time that works for everyone." (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   Schedules are presented as a list of blocked time slots for each participant, sometimes including preferences ("would rather not meet on Tuesday" or "do not want to meet on Monday before 10:30"). The time slots are typically in half-hour intervals. (Identified in Iteration 2, Iteration 3)
*   **Preference vs. Hard Constraint:** A clear distinction exists between hard constraints (blocked calendar times) and soft constraints (preferences like "would rather not meet"). The system needs to accurately differentiate and prioritize hard constraints to find a valid solution, then optimize for preferences. Example: "Douglas do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30" (soft constraint/preference), versus "Douglas is busy on Wednesday 12:30 to 13:00" (hard constraint). (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Implied Availability:** The questions imply that a solution exists within the given constraints. The system should be optimized to find *a* solution and should not give up too easily. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Varying Complexity:** The complexity of the questions varies significantly based on the number of participants and the density of their existing schedules. Problems with seven or more participants and densely packed schedules are more challenging. Meeting time preferences add an additional layer of constraint. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   The complexity arises from needing to reconcile multiple participants' schedules across potentially multiple days (now confirmed to often be a single day - Monday) while adhering to duration and preference constraints. (Identified in Iteration 2, Iteration 3)
*   The dataset presents meeting scheduling problems with varying numbers of participants and complex time constraints. (Identified in Iteration 3)
*   The constraints include blocked calendar slots for each participant, desired meeting duration, and explicit meeting time preferences for some participants (e.g., "do not want to meet on Monday before 10:30"). (Identified in Iteration 3)

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   **Multi-Agent Approach (Promising, but needs refinement):** Decomposing the problem into information extraction, time availability finding, and solution verification is a conceptually sound strategy. The key is to improve the individual agents and their communication. The architecture with dedicated information extraction, solution generation, and verification agents appears sound, but the implementation of each agent needs refinement. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **LLM-Driven Information Extraction (Promising, but needs improvement):** The LLM-driven approach to information extraction shows promise. The ability to use an LLM agent to identify participants, their availability, and constraints is more robust than relying solely on regex parsing. However, the accuracy of this extraction needs improvement. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   The overall framework of using LLMs for information extraction, reasoning, and solution verification seems sound, as indicated by the baseline accuracy. (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   Providing examples in the prompts to guide LLM's reasoning could be useful in structuring the LLM response and giving it a structured response (more on this later). (Identified in Iteration 2, Iteration 3)
*   The chain-of-thought approach, breaking down the scheduling problem into information extraction, time finding, and solution verification, is a promising strategy. (Identified in Iteration 3)
*   Using a specialized agent for each stage allows for modularity and targeted improvements. (Identified in Iteration 3)
*   Embedding example usages in the prompts provides useful guidance for the LLM, enabling more accurate information extraction and constraint satisfaction. (Identified in Iteration 3)

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **Inaccurate Constraint Integration (High Impact):** The most significant failure mode is the inability to accurately combine multiple constraints to find valid meeting times. The system might overlook a small window of availability that satisfies all participants because it struggles to synthesize the different schedule blocks. *Example: In the first failed question from iteration 0, the system lists multiple possible timeslots, but fails to arrive at the same timeslot the golden answer specifies*. This needs to account for variable meeting duration. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Incorrect Determination of Available Time Slots (High Impact):** This leads to proposing the wrong meeting time. For example, when Douglas is busy on Wednesday 12:30 to 13:00, the system answer said that Douglas is available from 9:00 - 12:30, 13:00 - 17:00 on Wednesday. This suggests a flaw in how the code calculates free time intervals from blocked schedules. The meeting duration is not being properly accounted for. Problems that involve multiple participants with complex, overlapping schedules exacerbate this issue. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Inaccurate Availability Reasoning:** The most frequent failure mode is incorrect determination of participant availability. The LLM struggles to accurately assess whether a time slot is free based on the provided schedules, leading to selecting times when one or more participants are busy, or conversely, falsely claiming no solution exists. For instance, in the first error example, the LLM incorrectly identifies 15:00-15:30 as invalid because "Donna, Kathleen, and Madison are busy," when the explanation states that Madison is available. (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   **Difficulty with Temporal Reasoning:** The LLM struggles with the temporal logic required to find a valid time slot across multiple schedules. It seems to process each participant's schedule in isolation but fails to combine the information to identify truly free slots. (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   **Misinterpretation of Constraints:** The provided error analysis suggests that the model might misinterpret or miss constraints such as meeting duration. (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   **Preference Handling (Medium Impact):** The system struggles with 'softer' constraints ("would rather not meet"). It appears that preferences are either ignored completely or given too much weight, leading to suboptimal solutions. *Example: See how the first answer from iteration 0 mentions the user's preference, but then fails to adhere to the user's preferences*. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **"No Solution Found" Errors (Medium Impact):** The system incorrectly reports "no solution found" even when valid solutions exist. This indicates a flaw in the availability checking logic or an overly strict interpretation of the constraints. *Example: In the third failed question from iteration 0, the system reports that no solution was found, even though the golden answer contains a proposed time.* (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Insufficient Verification (Medium Impact):** The current verification agent is not robust enough to catch errors in the available time slot calculation or constraint integration. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   The primary failure mode is the **inability to accurately compare the required meeting duration with the available time slots**, considering the blocked slots of all participants. This leads to the system incorrectly reporting "No valid meeting time found" even when feasible times exist. (Identified in Iteration 3)
*   **Inaccurate handling of time intervals:** The LLM struggles to correctly interpret and compare the blocked time intervals with the desired meeting duration. For example, if a meeting duration is 30 minutes, the LLM may fail to recognize a 30-minute available slot between two blocked intervals. (Identified in Iteration 3)
*   **Incorrectly handling exclusions/preferences:** When participants specify they don't want to meet before or after certain times, the system sometimes fails to account for this constraint when generating possible times. (Identified in Iteration 3)

**4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS**

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   **Initial Exploration Strategy:** Focused on a multi-agent approach with information extraction, availability finding, and solution verification. (Identified in Iteration 1)
    *   **Key Finding:** Confirmed the need for a stronger mechanism to handle the integration of multiple schedule constraints (hard and soft). The LLM is struggling to reconcile these properly. (Identified in Iteration 1)
    *   **Experiment Result:** Prompting the LLM with example tasks and solutions is not enough to guide the LLM in generating correct responses. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   **Experiment Goal:** Evaluate the feasibility of an LLM-driven approach to meeting scheduling using the multi-agent architecture. (Identified in Iteration 1)
    *   **Key Finding:** The LLM-driven approach is feasible, but initial accuracy is 60%, indicating substantial room for improvement. Accurate information extraction is critical, as inaccuracies propagate through the entire system. (Identified in Iteration 1)
    *   **Experiment Result:** The architecture with dedicated information extraction, solution generation, and verification agents appears sound, but the implementation of each agent needs refinement. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Iteration 2:**
    *   **Experiment Goal:** The approach of using the LLM for end-to-end problem solving (information extraction, reasoning, and verification). (Identified in Iteration 2)
    *   **Key Finding:** Achieved a moderate accuracy of 57%. (Identified in Iteration 2)
    *   **Experiment Result:** The results confirm the hypothesis that LLMs can perform the scheduling task, but high error rates show that the method needs refinement and are not yet reliable. The experiment reveals a significant weakness in precisely understanding busy/free times according to the specified schedules. (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   **Iteration 3:**
    *   **Experiment Goal:** Implementing a chain-of-thought approach with specialized agents and example usages. (Identified in Iteration 3)
    *   **Key Finding:** Achieved an accuracy of 0.67. (Identified in Iteration 3)
    *   **Experiment Result:** The initial hypothesis that breaking down the problem into smaller steps and using specialized agents would improve performance was partially confirmed. However, the accuracy of 0.67 indicates that significant improvements are still needed, particularly in constraint handling. The experiment revealed that while LLMs are capable of extracting information and reasoning about time constraints, they struggle with the precise comparison of meeting durations and available time slots. (Identified in Iteration 3)

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

*   **Focus on improving the time slot comparison logic**. The prompt needs to more explicitly guide the LLM to account for the meeting duration when identifying available time slots. This could involve adding more examples and breaking down the process into smaller steps. For instance, the LLM could first extract all the busy slots for each participant, then calculate the available slots, and finally check if any available slot is long enough to accommodate the meeting duration. (Identified in Iteration 3)
*   **Implement a verification agent** that checks if the generated solution satisfies all the constraints. This agent should explicitly verify that the proposed meeting time does not overlap with any participant's blocked calendar slots and respects any time preferences specified. This should catch edge cases where the LLM generates incorrect solutions. (Identified in Iteration 3)
*   **Refine the prompts** used for information extraction, focusing on accurately capturing all the blocked time intervals and time preferences for each participant. (Identified in Iteration 3)
*   **Add specific test cases** to the dataset that focus on the identified failure modes. These test cases should involve complex time constraints and edge cases to better evaluate the performance of the system. (Identified in Iteration 3)
*   **Consider adding a dedicated function that handles time-based comparisons**, specifically, to compare the desired meeting duration with the avaiable time slots by performing calculations and checking conditions. The output of this function can then be used as the input to the solution verification agent. This will decrease the chances of constraint mishandling. (Identified in Iteration 3)
*   **Enhance Availability Reasoning:** Redesign the prompt to force the LLM to use more rigorous and explicit logic when checking availability. For example, include a "cross-checking" step where the LLM must explicitly confirm that *every* participant is free during a proposed slot. Consider also explicitly providing a Python code snippet to assist the LLM in calculating the availability of each participant:

    ```python
    def is_available(participant, time_slot, schedule):
      # Function to check if a participant is available in a time slot
      # based on their schedule
      ...
    ```
    (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   **Structured Output:** Rather than relying on free-form text, request the LLM to output the schedule analysis in a structured format. For each time slot under consideration, it should explicitly state whether each participant is available or not, and its reasoning for that determination. (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   **Verify extracted schedule information:** Add a verifier agent to improve the performance and reduce the failure modes of extracting the correct information. (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Instead of a single LLM call for the entire reasoning process, break it down into smaller, verifiable steps. The output of each step should be checked before proceeding to the next. (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   **Exploit with stronger example set:** The examples provided to the LLM are important and can guide it in answering the question properly. We should make a careful analysis on why it produced the wrong answer and provide an example of the correct flow. (Identified in Iteration 2)
*   **Improve Information Extraction Agent:** Focus on improving the accuracy of the information extraction agent, specifically the logic that determines available time slots for each participant. Re-architect this component to handle variable meeting duration. Explicitly identify hard vs. soft constraints and their priorities. Provide explicit instructions and examples on how to treat preferences differently from hard constraints. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Enhance Solution Generation Agent:** Better handle multiple participants and complex scheduling constraints. Test with scenarios that have seven or more participants and dense schedules. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Strengthen Verification Agent:** Improve the verification agent to catch more errors. Give the agent access to the extracted information and the raw problem text so it can double-check the solution. Tune the solution verifier agent to be very precise in its constraint checking and output in a structured format. Implement an iterative loop where a "solution proposer" agent suggests a meeting time, and a separate "solution verifier" agent rigorously checks if it violates any constraints. The proposer then refines the suggestion based on the verifier's feedback. This can use chain-of-thought to ensure all constraints are considered. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Implement Dedicated Constraint Handling Functions:** Implement intermediate steps in the script that programmatically handle constraints. For example, the script could use an LLM to extract constraints, but then handle the application of the constraints with code. This can create a hybrid approach. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Debugging Mode:** Consider adding a debugging mode that outputs the intermediate steps of the scheduling process, so the source of errors can be diagnosed more easily. (Identified in Iteration 1)
*   **Diversify Prompt Examples:** Create more diverse examples for the prompt to ensure that a wider range of cases is covered. (Identified in Iteration 1)

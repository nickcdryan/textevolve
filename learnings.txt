# Knowledge Integrator: Synthesized Learnings for Meeting Scheduling Task

This document serves as a comprehensive research log for the meeting scheduling task, capturing dataset patterns, effective strategies, common failure modes, experiment logs, and future research directions.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   The dataset consists of meeting scheduling tasks formatted as instructions. Each task presents a scenario with participants, constraints on schedules, meeting duration, and preferences for meeting times. The questions instruct the system to schedule a meeting given these constraints.
*   A common structure involves specifying the task (scheduling a meeting for certain participants), listing existing schedules for each participant, and outlining preferences or restrictions on meeting times. The solution is expected to be a specific time slot that accommodates all constraints and preferences.
    *   Example: "Schedule a meeting for John, Jane, and Peter for 30 minutes. John is available from 9am-12pm, Jane is available from 10am-1pm, and Peter is available from 11am-12pm. Ideally, schedule the meeting at 11am."
*   The questions follow a consistent template: a persona ("You are an expert at scheduling meetings"), a task description outlining participants, duration, and preferred days/times, followed by each participant's existing schedule, and finally a request to "Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints".
*   The schedules are presented as a list of time intervals during which participants are busy, usually specified with start and end times (e.g., "9:00 to 9:30"). Time slots are always specified in half-hour increments.
*   The dataset includes constraints such as "do not want to meet before/after" and "would like to avoid meetings on certain days." It also includes varied preferences that add constraints (e.g., "Walter would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 12:00").
*   The complexity varies based on the number of participants (from 2 to 7 in the samples) and the differing availability constraints for each, often spanning multiple days. The complexity increases exponentially with the number of participants.
*   The tasks are consistently presented as meeting scheduling problems with participant availability and constraints. The format consistently includes:
    *   A role-playing instruction: "You are an expert at scheduling meetings."
    *   A "TASK:" description outlining meeting requirements (participants, duration, timeframe).
    *   "Here are the existing schedules..." providing participant availability for specific days. This section is relatively free-form.
    *   Constraints on specific participant availability ("can not meet on...", "would rather not meet on...").
    *   A request to "Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints."
*   The questions follow a consistent structure: a preamble describing the task, a "TASK" section outlining the scheduling requirements (participants, duration, time window), a "Here are the existing schedules..." section listing individual availabilities, and a final request to "Find a time that works...".
*   The schedules are detailed and can involve multiple participants, multiple days, and various time blocks, increasing complexity. The schedules are presented as free-text sentences, each describing a participant and their availability.
*   The existing schedules are presented as blocked time intervals for each participant on specific days. These schedules are described in a natural language format (e.g., "9:00 to 10:30").
*   The schedules are presented in a structured, sentence-based format (e.g., "Ronald has meetings on Monday during 9:30 to 10:30, 13:00 to 13:30, 15:30 to 16:00"). This requires parsing and conversion into a usable data structure for conflict detection.
*   The questions include negative constraints in the form of preferences or unavailability for specific participants on certain days (e.g., "Pamela does not want to meet on Tuesday").
*   Questions include a mix of hard constraints (meeting duration, work hours, participant availability) and soft constraints (e.g., "Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:00"). Successfully scheduling requires satisfying all hard constraints and optimizing for soft constraints.
*   When questions involve multiple possible days (e.g., "Monday or Tuesday"), the system struggles to correctly identify a valid day and time, often overlooking feasible slots or selecting suboptimal days.
*   The questions follow a consistent format: a system prompt ("You are an expert at scheduling meetings...") followed by a task description, participant schedules, and a request to "Find a time that works...".
*   Participant schedules are presented as blocked time slots within a specified workday range (9:00-17:00). These slots often have 30-minute granularity. The blocked calendar contains some amount of randomness. The "Here are the existing schedules..." section uses natural language and varies in the way the schedules are expressed, using ranges and listing multiple unavailable times. It also often includes 'has no meetings the whole week' for one or more participants.
*   The desired output is a specific time slot (day and start/end time) that accommodates all participant constraints.
*   The questions contain a preference for a day or time or participant. This information needs to be extracted properly. There's an implicit requirement to find *a* solution, not necessarily *the optimal* solution (e.g., earliest). But one question does include "earliest availability."

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   Using the LLM to extract the constraints from the text is effective. The LLM can understand and parse the time constraints and preferences for each participant, which are crucial for generating a valid schedule.
*   Validating the schedule using step by step reasoning. By taking smaller steps it ensures that there are not incorrect deductions and this will lead to a correct answer in most cases.
*   The Chain-of-thought reasoning in the `schedule_meeting` function helps the model to systematically consider all constraints and suggest available time slots, which is important for finding a solution.
*   The use of LLMs for both extracting meeting information and scheduling is a reasonable approach, given the complexity of the task.
*   The few-shot examples help LLMs understand task expectations and formats.
*   Verification loops are likely beneficial for improving the accuracy of information extraction.
*   The multi-agent workflow using LLMs for constraint extraction, schedule generation, and verification is a good approach. The multi-agent structure supports modularity and allows for explicit reasoning steps.
*   The `verify_schedule` function's explicit reasoning about constraint satisfaction allows the system to identify issues with proposed times.
*   We need to find an approach that reliably parses the input and generates valid output. JSON parsing is failing so we should try a different output strategy.
*   The ReAct pattern seems beneficial for breaking down the complex scheduling problem into smaller reasoning and action steps. It enables the LLM to consider one participant's availability at a time. However, the current implementation appears to be failing in iterating through the options and participants properly.
*   The modularity of having separate functions for extracting information, scheduling, and verifying shows promise for targeted refinement.
*   Decomposing the problem into constraint extraction, schedule generation, and schedule verification shows promise. The modular approach allows targeted refinement of each step.
*   Using an LLM to generate a meeting schedule based on extracted constraints works in principle, identifying *a* valid time if not necessarily the earliest one. The error rate suggests that schedule generation itself is somewhat reliable, with the core issue being optimization/earliness.
*   Breaking the problem into constraint extraction and schedule generation stages shows promise, as indicated by the partial success (40% accuracy initially, now 80%). The multi-stage design leverages the LLM to understand the complex constraints involved in the problem, rather than relying on deterministic algorithms. The LLM is able to interpret and handle human preferences, blocked calendars, duration etc. The LLM is being used to find the appropriate calculation (finding free time) to preform.
*   The constraint verification loop is effective in ensuring necessary information is captured before proceeding to schedule generation.
*   The overall approach of decomposing the task into extraction, scheduling, and verification using LLMs is a sound strategy. It allows for modularity and targeted prompt engineering for each sub-task.
*   Using the LLM to "propose" a schedule, as opposed to generating the *entire* reasoning process, seems like a reasonable choice. This offloads the more complex reasoning to the LLM while potentially simplifying the verification stage.
*   The general prompting strategy of providing a persona (meeting scheduling expert) likely helps the LLM to provide relevant responses.
*   Decomposing the problem into constraint extraction, schedule generation, and schedule verification proves beneficial. This modularity enables more targeted improvements for each sub-task.
*   Using an LLM to extract constraints from the text, rather than regex, allows for more flexibility in handling variations in how the schedules are expressed.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   The primary failure mode is **incorrect constraint application during the evaluation of time slots**. For instance, the system incorrectly determined Pamela's Wednesday availability. The system incorrectly evaluated a potential time, leading to the dismissal of the expected solution.
*   These errors typically occur in the `verify_schedule` function, where the model misinterprets or overlooks the existing schedules of participants when checking if a time slot is available.
*   **Primary failure:** The *schedule generation* step incorrectly selects time slots despite correctly extracting the constraints in the "Reasoning" section. This is visible in multiple error examples, where the proposed time violates the listed busy times. The issue is not in extracting the constraints, but in the reasoning used to propose the schedule, causing it to fail dataset constraint requirements. The LLM either fails to *generate* a valid meeting time in the first place or proposes invalid times (even if the verification catches it). The system *primarily* focuses on *validating* a single pre-existing time slot instead of *searching for* or *creating* a suitable solution.
*   The system struggles with scheduling across multiple days when preferences are involved (e.g. avoiding meetings at certain times on certain days). This makes it unable to produce the correct meeting day/time with existing prompt strategies.
*   The most prevalent failure stems from miscalculating participant availability based on their schedules. This is primarily because of incorrect parsing/reasoning about the time intervals in the schedules.
*   **Soft Constraint Neglect:** The system demonstrates inconsistency in incorporating soft constraints. Even when availability is calculated correctly, the scheduler often fails to prioritize slots that align with preferences (e.g., "earliest availability," "avoid meetings after X time").
*   **Day Selection Errors:** When questions involve multiple possible days (e.g., "Monday or Tuesday"), the system struggles to correctly identify a valid day and time, often overlooking feasible slots or selecting suboptimal days.
*   **`JSONDecodeError`**: The primary failure mode observed early on was the LLM's inability to consistently generate valid JSON output. This prevented the system from properly extracting and processing the meeting information.
    *   Example: The LLM generates output with missing brackets, incorrect key-value pairs, or additional free-form text, which the JSON parser cannot handle.
    *   The lack of specific constraints on the LLM output format in the prompt results in unpredictable responses that the JSON parser cannot handle.
*   **Invalid Meeting Times**: The system fails to generate valid meeting times that satisfy all constraints related to participant schedules and preferences. The `schedule_meeting` function seems to be the primary point of failure.
*   **Constraint Violations**: The current approach does not effectively handle complex combinations of constraints. For example, the constraints, "do not want to meet before/after" and "would like to avoid meetings on certain days" are not being adhered to when generating the proposed meeting time.
*   **Missing Google API Key**: Scripts may fail because the GOOGLE_API_KEY is missing.
    *   Example: Running the script with any call to `google.genai` will throw an error such as: `Script failed due to missing attribute in google.genai module.`
*   **Missing attributes in `google.genai`**: Some repairs may result in a script that is syntactically correct but fails because a required attribute or module is not found in the google.genai libraries.
    *   Example: Any call to `google.genai` that uses attributes that are not yet present in the library will throw an error.
*   The current approach **prematurely terminates the search**. In the provided error examples, the LLM identifies a conflict (e.g., "Lori has a meeting from 14:30 to 15:00"), and then halts the process entirely, *without attempting to find another valid time*. The system incorrectly interprets the first scheduling conflict as an indicator that there isn't a solution.
*   The LLM struggles with the interplay of *multiple constraints*. When multiple participants have overlapping busy slots, the system fails to navigate the combinations to find the valid meeting time.
*   There's a potential fragility in the LLM's ability to consistently *reason* about time intervals and overlaps, leading to the "INVALID" flags from the system.
*   The system consistently fails to identify the *earliest* available time slot that meets all constraints. This is most often manifest by valid but non-optimal answers.
*   The lack of a systematic algorithm to search for the earliest time is a major cause of failure. The LLM is likely finding the first valid time it encounters without systematically searching for the absolute earliest.
*   The verification step can detect *invalid* schedules, but does not penalize *non-optimal* schedules, resulting in a high acceptance rate of suboptimal answers.
*   **Schedule Verification Failure:** The most critical failure occurs during the schedule verification stage. The system often proposes times that conflict with participant schedules, indicating an incomplete or inaccurate integration of constraints during schedule generation or a flaw in the verification logic itself.
*   **Preference Ignoring:** In some failure cases (as implied by a desire to not meet on a particular day) the system generates schedules that don't meet preferences. This implies the system doesn't understand these constraints.
*   **Inaccurate Time Calculations:** The solutions produce times that don't quite work for duration or don't properly exclude a given participants calendar block.
*   **Constraint Handling Errors:** The system demonstrably fails to accurately process participant availability. Specifically, it does not reliably combine all the different inputs in the constraints section to find a time that respects the constraints. This results in the selection of time slots that conflict with existing schedules or preferences.
*   **Inconsistent Time Slot Selection:** The system proposes meeting times that deviate from the "expected" meeting times, indicating a fundamental issue with the scheduling logic. It's not clear if the scheduling agent or the verification agent is at fault, but the proposed times are incorrect.
*   **Natural Language Schedule Parsing Errors:** The LLM struggles with the various ways the dataset represents existing schedules in natural language. The variety of phrasing and schedule representations (e.g., "9:00 to 10:30", "11:00 to 12:30, 13:00 to 15:00") likely causes extraction and interpretation errors.
*   Even with a partially successful constraint extraction and verification loop, the generated schedules fail because the constraints are not accurately combined. The LLM calls themselves may be individually accurate, but the constraint processing is not correct when the different pieces are put together.
*   The current system struggles when constraints include phrases like "do not want to meet after...", as demonstrated in the first error example. This indicates issues in fully parsing negative constraints.
*   Inaccurate Availability Calculation is mainly because of incorrect parsing/reasoning about the time intervals in the schedules.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Iteration 0**:
    *   **Approach**: The initial approach relies on the LLM to extract meeting information in JSON format and then schedule the meeting based on that information.
    *   **Findings**: This approach is ineffective without stricter control over the LLM's output format.
    *   **Error**: The verification loop, intended to correct the extracted information, cannot function properly due to the initial JSON parsing failure.
    *   **Accuracy**: 0.00
    *   **Runtime Errors**: Several scripts threw `JSONDecodeError`, `AttributeError`, and failed Google API calls.

*   **Iteration 1**:
    *   **Approach**: Use LLMs for extracting meeting information and scheduling, incorporating few-shot examples and verification loops.
    *   **Findings**: LLMs are promising for this approach, but the current approach is not robust enough. The verification loop is not sufficient to guarantee constraint satisfaction.
    *   **Accuracy**: 0.20
    *   **Failure**: The system fails to generate valid meeting times that satisfy all constraints related to participant schedules and preferences. The `schedule_meeting` function seems to be the primary point of failure.

*   **Iteration 2**:
    *   **Approach**: ReAct pattern with modular functions for information extraction, scheduling, and verification.
    *   **Findings**: ReAct shows promise but the current search strategy is insufficient for handling complex constraint combinations. The system prematurely terminates the search after encountering initial conflicts.
    *   **Accuracy**: 0.20
    *   **Failure**: The LLM identifies a conflict (e.g., "Lori has a meeting from 14:30 to 15:00"), and then halts the process entirely, *without attempting to find another valid time*. The system incorrectly interprets the first scheduling conflict as an indicator that there isn't a solution. The LLM also struggles with the interplay of *multiple constraints*.
    *   The error analysis strongly suggests that the *search strategy* within the ReAct loop is the bottleneck.

*   **Iteration 3**:
    *   **Approach**: Three-agent design dividing the process into constraint extraction, schedule generation, and schedule validation.
    *   **Findings**: The three-agent design appears structurally sound, but requires enhancement for schedule optimization.
    *   **Accuracy**: 0.40
    *   **Failure**: The LLM performs poorly at identifying the *earliest* meeting time given the constraints without explicit optimization techniques. Verification does not penalize suboptimal schedules.

*   **Iteration 4**:
    *   **Approach**: (Implicit from the context: likely refinement of the three-agent design) Focus on constraint extraction and schedule generation using a multi-stage design.
    *   **Findings**: Decomposing the problem shows potential, but the weak link is in ensuring that *all* extracted constraints are simultaneously satisfied in the generated schedule. The constraint extraction and verification loops were partially successful, but aren't as reliable as desired.
    *   **Accuracy**: (Not explicitly stated but implied to be still around 0.40)
    *   **Failure**: The most critical failure occurs during the schedule verification stage. The system often proposes times that conflict with participant schedules, indicating an incomplete or inaccurate integration of constraints during schedule generation or a flaw in the verification logic itself. Preference are often ignored. Inaccurate time calculations are produced.

*   **Iteration 5**:
    *   **Approach**: (Implicit from the context: likely further refinement of constraint handling within the multi-stage design).
    *   **Findings**: 40% accuracy shows the system has basic understanding, but constraint handling needs major improvements. Accurate extraction and application of constraints, not generating a schedule *per se* is the bottleneck. The LLM calls themselves may be individually accurate, but the constraint processing is not correct when the different pieces are put together. The hypothesis that LLMs can effectively handle the entire scheduling process in a modular fashion is partially supported.
    *   **Accuracy**: 0.40
    *   **Failure**: The system fails to accurately process participant availability by failing to combine the different inputs in the constraints section to find a time that respects the constraints. This results in the selection of time slots that conflict with existing schedules or preferences. The system proposes meeting times that deviate from the "expected" meeting times. The LLM struggles with the various ways the dataset represents existing schedules in natural language, causing extraction and interpretation errors.

*   **Iteration 6**:
    *   **Approach**: Exploitation of the 3-stage extraction/generation/verification approach. (Implicit)
    *   **Findings**: Exploiting the 3-stage extraction/generation/verification approach did not improve accuracy beyond 70%. The core issue is the unreliable reasoning within the schedule generation step.
    *   **Accuracy**: 0.70
    *   **Failure**: The *schedule generation* step incorrectly selects time slots despite correctly extracting the constraints in the "Reasoning" section. This is visible in multiple error examples, where the proposed time violates the listed busy times. The system struggles with scheduling across multiple days when preferences are involved (e.g. avoiding meetings at certain times on certain days).

*   **Iteration 7**:
    *   **Approach**: Exploitation of the multi-agent workflow (LLMs for constraint extraction, schedule generation, and verification).
    *   **Findings**: The multi-agent structure supports modularity and allows for explicit reasoning steps.
    *   **Accuracy**: 0.80
    *   **Failure**: The *primary* failure mode stems from the LLM either failing to *generate* a valid meeting time in the first place or proposing invalid times (even if the verification catches it). The system *primarily* focuses on *validating* a single pre-existing time slot instead of *searching for* or *creating* a suitable solution. The current system struggles when constraints include phrases like "do not want to meet after...".

*   **Iteration 8**:
    *   **Approach**: (Implicit: likely a continued refinement of the multi-agent system) Focused on improving the schedule parsing, modeling soft constraints, and considering day-based availability.
    *   **Findings**: Multi-agent architecture shows promise but struggles with reasoning errors related to time/duration understanding and integrating soft constraints.
    *   **Accuracy**: (Not explicitly stated, but presumably around the same or slightly better than Iteration 7)
    *   **Failure**: The most prevalent failure stems from miscalculating participant availability based on their schedules due to incorrect parsing/reasoning about the time intervals. The system also demonstrates inconsistency in incorporating soft constraints and makes errors in day selection when multiple days are possible.

*   **Iteration 9**:
    *   **Approach**: Refinement of existing approach, focusing on validation of schedules with step-by-step reasoning.
    *   **Findings**: The exploitation strategy led to high accuracy (0.92), suggesting the architecture and core LLM-driven techniques are sound, but precise constraint application during schedule evaluation needs improvement.
    *   **Accuracy**: 0.92
    *   **Failure**: The primary failure mode is incorrect constraint application during the evaluation of time slots, particularly within the `verify_schedule` function. For instance, the system incorrectly determined Pamela's Wednesday availability, leading to the dismissal of the expected solution.
*   **2025-04-19 04:04:47**: Script repair attempt resulted in a `JSONDecodeError`. This indicates a problem with the LLM generating valid JSON, or the parsing logic.
*   **2025-04-19 04:04:57**: Script repair attempt resulted in a failed script due to a missing attribute in the `google.genai` module. This may indicate an attempt to call an attribute in the `google.genai` module that is not available (either a typo or an unsupported attribute).
*   **2025-04-19 04:05:07**: Script repair attempt failed because the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` was missing. This could be because of environmental variable configuration or a direct call to the module without proper credentials.
*   **2025-04-19 04:07:18**: Script repair attempt resulted in an error message in the script output.
*   **2025-04-19 04:07:26**: Script repair attempt resulted in a failed script due to a missing attribute 'GenerativeModel' in the `google.genai` module.
*   **2025-04-19 04:07:34**: Script repair attempt failed due to multiple "Error calling Gemini API" messages and a final "Error: 'GOOGLE_API_KEY'", indicating a failure related to the API key.
*   **2025-04-19 04:19:11**: Script repair attempt resulted in an error message in the script output: "Error: INVALID: No meeting time can satisfy all the constraints.". This shows a deeper issue relating to the ability to solve the scheduling problem.
*   **2025-04-19 04:19:23**: Script repair attempt resulted in a failed script due to a missing attribute 'GenerativeModel' in the `google.genai` module.
*   **2025-04-19 04:19:35**: Script repair attempt resulted in a failed script due to an "Unexpected keyword argument in GenerationConfig initialization," indicative of an API version incompatibility or incorrect use of the API.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   Enhance the `verify_schedule` function to improve its constraint application.
    *   Add specific test prompts for `verify_schedule` with complicated overlapping constraints.
    *   Within `verify_schedule`, consider adding a step where extracted constraints are re-stated and re-verified before being applied. This could act as a "double-check" to catch misinterpretations early.
*   Implement a stricter parsing and validation of time intervals in the schedule extraction to ensure consistent formatting, as subtle differences in time formatting (e.g., "9:00-9:30" vs. "9:00 to 9:30") can lead to errors in schedule evaluation.
*   Significantly rework the `schedule_meeting` function. Instead of generating a single candidate time and relying on verification, make the function generate *multiple* candidate times, or have the LLM actively *search* for a suitable time. Re-prompt this agent to focus on *generating* valid meeting times.
*   Enhance the constraint extraction to better handle negative constraints. The `extract_constraints` function should be improved to identify negative preferences (e.g., "do not want to meet after") and explicitly represent them for use in the scheduling and verification steps.
*   Consider adding an explicit function/agent whose *sole purpose* is to generate a list of *possible* meeting times, before any availability checks occur. This could offload the generation burden from the `schedule_meeting` function. The times will then be passed to the `schedule_meeting` function. Add "generate candidate times" agent.
*   Focus on improving the `schedule_meeting` function's reasoning process. This is the weakest link. Implement a detailed chain-of-thought approach within this function. Make the LLM explicitly list *all* available time slots for *each* participant, then systematically eliminate times that violate constraints, before finally proposing a time.
*   In the prompt for schedule generation, add few-shot examples that demonstrate the chain-of-thought reasoning process described above, showing how to filter available slots based on the listed constraints.
*   In the `verify_schedule` function, include a more stringent verification. Have the LLM explicitly confirm that the proposed time does not conflict with *any* of the extracted constraints.
*   Re-introduce a deterministic element, like a Python function that calculates the available time slots. Let the LLM propose slots, but then use the code to verify that slot for that person. This will improve the accuracy of busy slot extraction.
*   When generating the schedule, try creating a "conflict matrix" - a table that shows which times don't work for which participants. The LLM can use this table to find an empty slot efficiently.
*   Modify the prompt for the `extract_meeting_info` function to include stricter instructions on the output format. Include a clear JSON schema and examples of valid JSON outputs. Try to use a simpler, non-JSON format.
*   Implement a more robust error handling mechanism that can catch JSON parsing errors and attempt to re-prompt the LLM with specific feedback on the format errors. Use `max_attempts` to avoid infinite loops.
*   Consider a multi-stage approach where the LLM first generates the meeting information in plain text, and then a secondary function converts the plain text into JSON format (or a more reliable format) to increase reliability.
*   Provide multiple examples (few-shot learning) within the prompt to guide the LLM towards generating consistent and correctly formatted JSON responses. Experiment with the number of examples (2-5).
*   Ensure that `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is configured correctly and available in the environment. Implement checks in the script to verify the key is present.
*   Verify that the attributes used in the `google.genai` calls are valid and available in the current library version. If necessary, update the libraries to use the right attributes.
*   Explore alternative LLM prompting strategies that avoid relying on perfect JSON output. For example, try having the LLM output a simple list of key-value pairs, or using a ReAct approach where the system reasons about the problem and takes actions to gather the necessary information.
*   Modify the `schedule_meeting` function to more accurately incorporate all constraints when proposing a meeting time.
*   Refine the prompt for `schedule_meeting` to explicitly ask the LLM to show its reasoning process, including why the chosen time works for all participants.
*   Implement a deterministic checking process after `schedule_meeting` to verify that the generated meeting time satisfies *all* constraints. If it doesn't, re-prompt the LLM with feedback.
*   Experiment with increasing the number of few-shot examples, especially including examples with conflicting preferences.
*   **Crucially, modify the ReAct loop to *continue searching* for valid times even after encountering initial conflicts.** The LLM *must* be encouraged to explore alternative time slots. Implement a more systematic search: e.g., iterate through days and then timeslots within those days, checking all participants' availability for each potential slot. Include max_attempts safeguards to prevent indefinite execution.
*   Introduce more sophisticated constraint handling. Experiment with methods to explicitly represent the constraints as data structures and use the LLM to *reason* over them.
*   Explicitly give the LLM examples of the search strategy failing and then recovering to find the solution.
*   Implement a 'backtracking' mechanism: if the LLM hits a dead-end (no solution found in a given time range), allow it to backtrack and try a different approach or different set of initial assumptions.
*   Consider making the solution generation process more deterministic; after the LLM extracts the relevant information, use Python code to iterate through all possible timeslots and verify them against the extracted schedules.
*   Refine the scheduling agent to *explicitly* search for the earliest valid time slot. Use a systematic approach to check times incrementally, starting from the beginning of the workday and considering each day sequentially.
*   Add a "preference" parameter to the `verify_schedule` prompt that evaluates *how well* a given schedule fulfills the request, rather than simple correctness. This should be used to assess if the generated schedule meets preference criteria (e.g. earliest available time).
*   Introduce a numerical approach to time representation for the verification step. Convert times to minutes from the start of the day for easier calculation of intervals.
*   Update the prompt for the scheduler agent to include a specific instruction to "find the EARLIEST possible time that satisfies all constraints". Include examples where the earliest time is not immediately apparent.
*   **Enhance schedule parsing:** Implement a robust parsing mechanism that converts the schedule strings into structured data (e.g., a list of time intervals) for efficient conflict detection.
*   **Verification of extracted times:** Add a step to explicitly verify the extracted schedule times with a second LLM call that presents the parsed information and asks if it's an accurate representation of the original text.
*   **Explicitly Model Soft Constraints:** Incorporate explicit prioritization of soft constraints during schedule generation. Have the LLM rank the available slots based on the degree to which they satisfy the soft constraints.
*   **Day-Based Availability Calculation:** When multiple days are possible, iterate through each day separately, calculating availability and then comparing the best slots across days.
*   **Prompting for day preference:** Add examples in the prompt of cases when a day should be preferred for various reasons (fewer conflicts, better soft constraint alignment, etc.)
*   **Enhanced Schedule Verification Agent:** Implement a dedicated "schedule verification agent" that rigorously checks the proposed meeting time against *each* participant's schedule. This agent should receive explicit schedule information as input and return a clear "valid" or "invalid" verdict, along with specific reasons for invalidity.
*   **Strengthen Preference Incorporation:** Refine the prompt to explicitly address human preferences. The model should have an understanding of these parameters. This could involve adding an extra verification step.
*   **Hybrid Verification:** Use deterministic Python to compare schedule to participant calendar if possible, because it will be exact. Use LLM for constraints and preferences.
*   Develop a more structured and reliable way to represent participant availability and constraints internally. Consider representing schedules as a structured object or a boolean array.
*   The extraction prompts need to be more robust to handle the various ways schedules are expressed in the dataset. Provide the LLM with more examples of schedule formats and explicitly instruct it to handle variability.
*   Develop a dedicated Python function to rigorously check for scheduling conflicts given the structured representation of schedules and constraints. This will offload the most critical, deterministic part of the task from the LLM to code.
*   Create a set of examples that specifically target the constraint handling issues identified. Use these examples to iteratively refine the extraction and conflict-checking logic.
*   The verifier agent should be more precise in its assessment of whether or not a schedule respects all of the constraints. It may be better to have it output a list of specific unmet constraints, rather than a single 'valid' boolean.
*   The `extract_constraints` function should be improved to identify negative preferences (e.g., "do not want to meet after") and explicitly represent them for use in the scheduling and verification steps.
*   Address the runtime errors and script failures by ensuring the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is correctly configured, verifying the attributes used in the `google.genai` calls are valid and available in the current library version, and implementing robust error handling mechanisms with specific feedback. Prioritize fixing these errors to enable further progress.

# Synthesized Learnings: Meeting Scheduling Task

This document serves as a detailed research log for the meeting scheduling task, focusing on dataset-specific patterns, effective strategies, common failure modes, experiment findings, and future research directions.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Question Template:** Questions consistently follow the structure: "You are an expert at scheduling meetings..." (introduces the agent's role), followed by a `TASK` description defining the meeting scheduling requirements, detailed schedules for each participant, and concluding with "Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints."
    *   *Example:* "You are an expert at scheduling meetings. TASK: Schedule a meeting for John, Lori, and Shahbaz for 30 minutes. John has meetings on Monday from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, and the entire day on Tuesday. Lori is only available on Wednesday and Thursday. Shahbaz is available all day on Monday and Tuesday, but not Wednesday or Thursday. Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints."
    *   *Iteration 4 Addition:* The questions present a scenario ("You are an expert...") followed by a specific TASK and then provide the existing schedules for each participant.
    *   *Iteration 5 Addition:* The questions follow a structured format: introduction, task description (scheduling meeting for X people for Y duration on Z day), participant schedule information, and a request to "Find a time that works...".
    *   *Iteration 7 Addition:* The questions follow a consistent format: an introductory sentence explaining the task, a "TASK" section outlining the specific meeting scheduling scenario with participants and duration, an "existing schedules" section detailing individual calendars, and a final instruction to find a suitable time.
    *   *Iteration 8 Addition:* The questions consistently include: a preamble introducing the problem, the specific people, days and times available, and any specific negative constraints (e.g., "Matthew would rather not meet on Monday."). The desired solution is a precise meeting time and day that satisfies all constraints.
    *   *Iteration 9 Addition:* The questions present meeting scheduling problems with constraints on participant availability, meeting duration, and preferred times.
*   **Schedule Descriptions:** Participant schedules are provided in natural language, describing busy slots and constraints for each individual. Schedules are full-week summaries.
    *   *Format:* "Name has meetings on Day during Start Time to End Time,...".
    *   *Examples:*
        *   "John has meetings on Monday from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00, and the entire day on Tuesday."
        *   "Lori is only available on Wednesday and Thursday." (Implies unavailability on other days)
        *   "Shahbaz is available all day on Monday and Tuesday, but not Wednesday or Thursday." (Explicitly states availability and unavailability)
        *   "John would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 14:30." (Example of a negative constraint)
        *   "Tyler can not meet on Monday" (Example of a constraint)
        *   "Donna would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 10:00" (Example of preference constraint introduced in Iteration 6)
        *   "Rebecca is busy from 10:00 to 10:30" (Example, Iteration 6)
    *   *Challenge:* Parsing and representing multiple busy slots for each person, including handling variations in time format (e.g., "9:00 to 9:30" vs. "the entire day"). Ranges that abut other ranges are particularly error-prone. Need to accurately parse the consistent "HH:MM - HH:MM" time format.
    *   *Iteration 5 Addition:* Participant availability is described in a verbose, natural language format, making it challenging to parse directly. This format includes specific time intervals when participants are busy.
    *   *Iteration 7 Addition:* The "existing schedules" section varies in how it presents availability. Some participants have explicitly listed blocked times, while others may have no listed times, implying full availability. Occasionally a schedule entry will contain a grammatical error, e.g. "Andrewhas no meetings the whole day."
    *   *Iteration 9 Addition:* Participant schedules are described using a mix of exact times (e.g., "9:00 to 10:30") and general statements (e.g., "is free the entire day").
*   **Constraints:** Questions include various constraints on the scheduling task.
    *   *Types:* Participant availability, meeting duration, acceptable days, and preferred times (avoidance of certain times). Includes both positive (available) and negative (unavailable/preferred avoidance) constraints.
    *   *Example:* "John would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 14:30." The phrasing related to constraints and preferences varies, requiring flexible natural language understanding.
*   **Guaranteed Solution:** The scheduling tasks implicitly guarantee that a valid solution exists. This can be exploited by the solving agent to re-try different solutions until a valid one is found.
    *   *Iteration 5 Addition:* The task is always guaranteed to have a solution that fits all the constraints and schedules.
*   **Consistent Template:** Questions follow a consistent template: an introductory instruction ("You are an expert at scheduling meetings..."), a TASK description outlining the meeting requirements, and a "Here are the existing schedules..." section detailing participant availability. (Learned in Iteration 2)
*   **Schedule Presentation:** The schedules are presented as blocked time intervals for each participant on specific days. The days of the week and the times are textual and need to be converted into machine-readable formats for computation. (Learned in Iteration 2)
*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** The questions invariably end with "Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints," indicating a constraint satisfaction problem. (Learned in Iteration 2)
*   **Structured Narrative Format:** The dataset presents scheduling tasks in a structured, narrative format. Each entry includes: (1) A task description, (2) Individual participant schedules with blocked time slots, and (3) Preferences or constraints (e.g., "Tyler can not meet on Monday"). (Learned in Iteration 3)
*   *Iteration 4 Addition:* Each participant's schedule is described in terms of blocked time slots on specific days, requiring careful parsing and comparison to find available times.
*   **Complex Temporal Constraints (Iteration 6):** The questions involve managing intricate, overlapping temporal constraints arising from multiple participants' existing schedules. This requires precise parsing and representation of time intervals.
*   **Preference-Based Constraints (Iteration 6):** Some participants have preferences (e.g., "do not want to meet before 10:00"), adding a layer of soft constraints that must be balanced against hard constraints (existing schedules).
*   **Existence of a Solution (Iteration 6):** Questions are explicitly designed to ensure *a* valid meeting time exists, allowing the system to focus on finding a viable schedule rather than determining if one is possible.
*   *Iteration 7 Addition:* The expected solutions are explicit timeslots, but the *actual* valid answers vary widely. The actual answers can be a refusal to provide a proposed time because of a conflict.
*   *Iteration 9 Addition:* The expected solutions are very specific, indicating the precise day and time for the meeting in the format "Here is the proposed time: \[Day], \[Start Time] - \[End Time]".

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Multi-Stage LLM-Driven Approach:** Decomposing the problem into stages (information extraction, constraint analysis, schedule generation, verification) shows potential. This modular design allows for focused improvements on specific sub-tasks.
    *   *Iteration 5 Addition:* The multi-agent system is on the right track because the division of labor helps organize the task and makes it more manageable. Splitting the task into information extraction, solution generation, and verification makes it easier to isolate and improve each aspect of the problem-solving process.
*   **Expert Agent Paradigm:** Using the LLM as an "expert agent" for specific sub-tasks (e.g., extracting meeting information, analyzing constraints) leverages its ability to understand context and apply rules.
*   **Example-Based Prompts:** Providing the LLM with example-based prompts during information extraction and constraint analysis offers guidance on expected formats and task objectives.
*   **Structured Representation for Schedules:** Converting natural language schedule descriptions into a standardized data structure (e.g., JSON) improves accuracy during constraint analysis and verification.
*   **Programmatic Time Comparisons:** Employing Python code for schedule intersection and conflict checking reduces reliance on the LLM for numerical comparison and constraint validation.
*   **Dynamic routing shows promise, and should be pursued more rigorously to ensure that correct routes are followed.** (Learned in Iteration 3)
*   **Ineffective Strategy:** The ReAct pattern implementation in its current form is ineffective for this dataset. (Learned in Iteration 2)
*   *Iteration 4 Addition:* The LLM's ability to analyze and identify conflicts between proposed schedules and participant availability is a strength. The breakdown of the schedules and the clear identification of conflicts in the "actual" outputs demonstrate this capability.
*   *Iteration 4 Addition:* The use of structured data extraction with the `extract_meeting_info` function is a promising direction, allowing for easier comparison of time slots. However, it is not yet implemented effectively.
*   *Iteration 4 Finding:* The overall approach (verifying schedules) is valid, but incomplete as it does not find the proposed meeting time by itself.
*   **Insufficient working strategies to list as the accuracy is low (Iteration 6)**
*   *Iteration 7 Finding:* The overall Chain-of-Verification approach has merit as a high-level strategy for constraint satisfaction, but is not effectively implemented. This is evidenced by the 40% accuracy, but also the ability of the validators to propose constraints that conflict with the actual answer.
*   *Iteration 8 Addition:* The attempt to use LLMs for data extraction by having them create a structured JSON worked well *in theory*. This is a better strategy than relying on brittle regex, because the LLM should understand the intent and context better.
    *Iteration 8 Addition:* The verification loop pattern also has merit *in theory* because it allows for iterative refinement of the extracted data and proposed solutions.
*   *Iteration 9 Addition:* The current approach extracts information and schedules a meeting time that it checks to be available for each person.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Unreliable JSON Output from LLM (PRIMARY FAILURE):** The `extract_structured_data` function frequently fails because the LLM doesn't consistently produce valid JSON, resulting in parsing errors ("Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"). This halts the entire process.
    *   *Iteration 8 Finding:* The system is vulnerable to subtle variations in the LLM's response. Even minor deviations from the expected JSON format cause the `json.loads` function to fail. This is not robust.
*   **System Lacks Solution Generation:** The system currently *only* verifies a provided schedule rather than generating one itself. This is a fundamental flaw explaining the low accuracy. The core problem is a lack of a schedule generation module, resulting in the system's inability to find and suggest the answer to the problem. (Learned in Iteration 4)
    *   *Iteration 5 Addition:* The system *often does not propose a solution time*. Instead, it describes the *approach* it will take, analyses part of the problem, or it stops after extracting information without generating a valid schedule. It must take the step to propose a specific meeting time. The example about Theresa and Frances highlights this, where the system simply stops with "Let's begin!" instead of providing a concrete time.
*   **Incorrect Evaluation of Availability (Schedule Verification):** The most significant failure mode is the misinterpretation of busy slots during schedule verification. The LLM often incorrectly determines whether a proposed time slot is available for a participant, leading to rejection of valid options and suggestion of invalid ones. The system misses or misinterprets blocked time ranges, leading to proposing invalid meeting times.
    *   *Example:* The system rejects a golden answer solution because it incorrectly identifies Lori as busy, despite Lori being available at that time.
    *   *Example (Iteration 3):* The proposed time (Tuesday, 12:30 - 13:30) clashes with Kelly's existing schedule, which the system failed to recognize.
    *   *Iteration 5 Addition:* Even when the system proposes a schedule, it can be *incorrect*. It incorrectly assesses participant availability, leading to invalid schedule proposals, and fails to find an answer that fulfills all constraints.
*   **Ambiguity from Natural Language Schedules:** Natural language descriptions of schedules introduce ambiguity that lead to errors during extraction and constraint analysis. Specifically, ranges that abut each other and implicit ranges (entire day) are problematic.
    *   *Example:* "9:00 to 9:30, 10:30 to 11:00" may be misinterpreted due to the lack of clear separation or because "9:30 to 10:30" is inferred to be a valid available slot.
*   **Incomplete/Incorrect Information Extraction:** Incomplete or incorrect extraction of participant names, durations, or time availabilities. Specifically, schedule descriptions are not completely parsed, leading to incorrect solutions. Missing information about constraints or scheduling information leads to constraint violations. The LLM struggles to accurately extract all the constraints. (Learned in Iteration 3)
*   **Inefficient Verification:** System gets stuck generating a sequence of intermediate steps for verifying schedules instead of directly generating the single valid proposed schedule, suggesting an overly verbose verification step.
*   **Lack of Negative Constraints Handling:** The system struggles to capture negative constraints (e.g., preferred days/hours) in the constraint analysis and validation steps.
*   **ReAct Loop Unpacking Errors:** The agent fails to correctly unpack information when processing the ReAct steps, leading to "too many values to unpack" errors. This suggests that the structure of the data returned by the LLM during the ReAct loop is not what the agent is expecting, possibly due to malformed LLM responses. (Learned in Iteration 2)
*   **Failure to Find Valid Solution:** The agent fails to find a valid solution even when a solution exists (as indicated by the golden answer), suggesting issues with constraint processing or search logic. (Learned in Iteration 2)
*   **Information Extraction Struggles:** The information extraction step likely struggles with the varied textual representations of time intervals, contributing to 0% accuracy. (Learned in Iteration 2)
*   **Reliance on LLM for Input Processing:** The reliance on the LLM to process the input is fragile. (Learned in Iteration 3)
*   **Insufficient Dynamic Routing:** Dynamic routing alone is insufficient without addressing the underlying parsing inaccuracies. (Learned in Iteration 3)
*   *Iteration 5 Addition:* The system answer validation can be wrong. One example shows the system proposing Tuesday at 9:00 - 9:30 and indicating that both Ralph and Patricia are available during that time, when a better answer is Monday at 14:00 - 14:30.
*   *Iteration 4 Note:* There were no error patterns explicitly categorized in the latest batch, which suggests that either error categorization is not well-defined, or there were no notable errors to categorize.
*   **Incorrect Existing Schedule Parsing (Iteration 6):** The system fails when it misinterprets the existing schedules of participants. For instance, it might not correctly recognize that Rebecca is busy from 10:00 to 10:30, leading it to propose a meeting time during that slot.
*   **Violation of Preference Constraints (Iteration 6):** Preference constraints such as "Donna would like to avoid more meetings on Monday before 10:00" are not being correctly applied.
*   **"Could not find valid schedule" Errors (Iteration 6):** The system frequently fails to find *any* valid solution, even when one exists. This suggests problems either in constraint representation, constraint propagation, or solution search. In cases where the correct answer involved a simple constraint satisfaction, the inability to find a solution hints at a fundamental flaw in how constraints are managed.
*   *Iteration 7 Addition:* The system fails to accurately account for the combination of multiple participants' schedules, leading to the "Invalid - \[Participant] is busy" errors, even when a time slot *does* exist that satisfies all constraints. This suggests an issue in how the extracted constraints are logically combined or how the proposed solutions are checked against those combined constraints.
*   *Iteration 7 Addition:* Inaccurate initial constraint extraction is a contributing factor. If `extract_constraints_and_availability` fails to capture the correct busy times for each person, this propagates through the rest of the chain.
*   *Iteration 7 Addition:* The system also appears to be missing implicit constraint checking, for example understanding that a "1 hour meeting between 9:00 and 17:00" means the latest possible start time is 16:00.
*   *Iteration 9 Addition:* The system incorrectly concludes that meetings cannot be scheduled when a proposed time conflicts with a participant's schedule, but fails to exhaustively search for alternative times that satisfy all constraints. It halts after finding the first conflict, without exploring other possibilities.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 20%
    *   **Finding:** The base multi-stage LLM-driven framework is not sufficient on its own to effectively solve scheduling problems within this dataset. Significant refinement is required.
    *   **Finding:** The modular design of the framework facilitates targeted improvement.
    *   **Finding:** LLMs provide the ability to reason through scheduling and its constraints, though imperfectly.
*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 20%
    *   **Finding:** Confirmed the viability of the multi-stage approach but revealed significant weaknesses in the verification and constraint-checking components.
    *   **Finding:** Focusing purely on natural language schedule parsing and reasoning is not sufficient.
    *   **Finding:** The primary bottleneck is misinterpretation of busy slots, making schedule verification the highest priority for improvement.
*   **Iteration 2:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.0%
    *   **Finding:** The ReAct pattern implementation in its current form is ineffective for this dataset. The incorrect data handling within the ReAct loop completely breaks down the scheduling process.
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis that a general-purpose ReAct agent could handle the complexity of these scheduling tasks was clearly rejected. The agent needs more precise guidance and data handling to succeed.
*   **Iteration 3:**
    *   **Accuracy:** (Not explicitly mentioned)
    *   **Finding:** The experiment confirmed that accurately extracting and interpreting schedule information is crucial for the success of the system and must be fixed before moving on.
*   **Iteration 4:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0%
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that LLMs can effectively verify meeting schedules was confirmed. The LLM demonstrates strong capabilities in identifying conflicts and providing explanations.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that a verification-focused approach alone can solve the meeting scheduling problem was rejected. It is clear that a schedule generation component is also needed.
    *   **Finding:** The experiment highlighted the need to shift the focus from only verifying schedules to *creating* them, which means the approach is valid, but incomplete.
*   **Iteration 5:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 20%
    *   **Finding:** Breaking down the task into information extraction, schedule generation, and verification does not guarantee a correct solution. The bottleneck appears to be a failure to robustly *generate* a candidate schedule and verifying against all constraints.
    *   **Finding:** This exploration strategy confirms that a multi-agent architecture *can* be structured to solve this problem.
    *   **Finding:** The low accuracy (20%) indicates that the current implementation of each agent (information extraction, solution generation, and verification) needs refinement.
*   **Iteration 6:**
    *   **Accuracy:** (Not explicitly mentioned)
    *   **Finding:** The Iterative Constraint Satisfaction with Multi-Agent Verification approach, while conceptually promising, struggles with correct and consistent constraint handling in practice. The failure suggests that the LLM agents are either misinterpreting constraints during extraction or are not consistently enforcing those constraints during candidate schedule generation and verification. The experiment highlights that relying solely on LLM reasoning for this type of problem is insufficient without robust validation.
*   **Iteration 7:**
    *   **Accuracy:** (40%)
    *   **Finding:** The Chain-of-Verification, as implemented, is insufficient for solving this dataset. The initial hypothesis was that multiple verification stages would catch errors, but the low accuracy shows that errors are still pervasive or the verification stages are themselves introducing errors.
    *   **Finding:** The errors show that the implemented chain-of-verification doesn't always work. The failure analysis indicates the error can occur in the extraction phase.
*   **Iteration 8:**
    *   **Accuracy:** (Not Explicitly Mentioned)
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that LLMs can reliably extract structured data from complex scheduling problems *was rejected*. The LLM struggles to consistently adhere to the JSON format.
    *   **Finding:** The attempt to use an LLM for the extraction task and then again for solution generation and verification, while conceptually sound, introduces multiple potential points of failure.
    *   **Finding:** The experiment highlighted the need for robust error handling and output validation, especially when relying on LLMs to generate structured data.
*   **Iteration 9:**
    *   **Accuracy:** (Not Explicitly Mentioned)
    *   **Finding:** The attempt to combine deterministic schedule generation with LLM extraction and verification failed to produce any correct answers.
    *   **Finding:** The failure highlights the need for an iterative solution generation, not just a one-shot attempt. The system needs to propose multiple candidate times and systematically test them against all constraints.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Implement an iterative and exhaustive solution generation process.** The `generate_schedule` function should be modified to generate a list of potential meeting times within the given constraints, and the system should iterate through these options until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted. (From Iteration 9)
*   **Implement a new function to generate multiple possible solutions with a maximum number of attempts, and a method to break from the loop.** (From Iteration 9)
*   **Integrate the proposed changes into the `main` function to utilize the function to generate more valid solutions.** (From Iteration 9)
*   **Implement robust JSON validation and correction**. If the LLM output is not valid JSON, implement a repair mechanism instead of crashing. The repair mechanism can involve:
        *   Using a regex pattern to extract the JSON from surrounding text
        *   Using another LLM call to repair the JSON.
*   **Consider a hybrid approach to data extraction**. Use the LLM to identify key entities and relationships, but then use deterministic code (e.g., simple string manipulation) to enforce the specific JSON format.
*   **Provide more robust examples to the LLM for the extraction task.** Include examples that cover different phrasing variations and potential edge cases. Vary the number of examples used in the few-shot prompts (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5 examples).
*   **Introduce a stricter system prompt for the LLM**. For instance: "You MUST respond ONLY in valid JSON format. Do NOT include any surrounding text or explanations."
*   **Simplify the extraction prompt**. Focus only on the most critical pieces of information needed for scheduling. Avoid over-complicating the extraction process with unnecessary details.
*   **Add retries with variations in prompt.** If the first extraction fails, retry with a slightly reworded prompt, or with more/fewer examples.
*   **After fixing the JSON issue, profile the system to determine if validation is fast enough and if the solutions proposed are of reasonable quality.**
*   **Enhance Constraint Extraction:** Focus on improving the accuracy and completeness of the `extract_constraints_and_availability` function. Implement a few-shot example with *multiple* examples (3-5) that cover the varied ways availability is expressed, and add a verification step immediately *after* extraction to catch errors early. This few-shot example should demonstrate common grammatical errors and how to handle them gracefully. (From Iteration 7)
*   **Revise Temporal Constraint Verifier**: Because the expected answers are frequently "no proposed time" rather than a specific time, the system may be too aggressive at extracting temporal constraints. Rewrite the `verify_temporal_constraints` validator to only return an error when the conflict is certain, not when the conflict is possible. Also, ensure it handles the case where "no time" is a valid answer. (From Iteration 7)
*   **Implement more rigorous verification**. The error examples indicate the verifier is missing conflicts. Either rewrite the `verify_temporal_constraints` validator, or add a new validator, that can check a proposed time against extracted availabilities, and return "Valid" or the name of the conflicting participant. (From Iteration 7)
*   **Consolidate and simplify code**: The modular design of the validators is good, but could be more effective. Ensure the validator code adheres to a narrow scope and is easy to follow and reason about. (From Iteration 7)
*   **Implement negative constraint extraction**. Add a step that attempts to extract constraints in natural language, such as "Bruce would rather not meet on Monday after 13:30.". These constraints may be missed in the existing extraction method. (From Iteration 7)
*   **Strengthen Constraint Parsing:** Revamp the `extract_constraints` function to ensure robust parsing of participant schedules. Use a combination of LLM-based information extraction and deterministic parsing (e.g., regex) with rigorous validation to create an accurate schedule representation. (From Iteration 6)
*   **Implement Deterministic Constraint Enforcement:** Create a dedicated Python module for enforcing temporal constraints. This module should take the parsed schedules as input and provide functions to check if a proposed meeting time violates any hard constraints. Replace LLM reasoning with direct logic. (From Iteration 6)
*   **Preference Handling Mechanism:** Introduce a dedicated mechanism for handling preference constraints. Possibly add a weighting system in the constraint checker, or only query the LLM on times that passed the hard constraints checker to see if the current potential time is favorable. (From Iteration 6)
*   **Crucially, implement a schedule GENERATION module.** This module should take the extracted information (participants, constraints, schedules) and propose candidate meeting times. The current verification module can then be used to validate these proposals. (From Iteration 4)
*   **Modify the solution generation agent to *always* produce at least one candidate schedule as an output.** (From Iteration 5)
*   **Improve the extraction agent's ability to *accurately and completely* identify each participant's busy slots to ensure a valid schedule.** (From Iteration 5)
*   **Strengthen the verification agent to confirm that a candidate schedule does not conflict with *any* participant's existing commitments. One approach could be to verify a single slot first and then loop through all constraints.** (From Iteration 5)
*   **Implement a ReAct pattern in the solution generation agent, generating a candidate schedule, checking if all constraints are met, and revising the schedule if needed, for a fixed number of attempts.** (From Iteration 5)
*   **Revise the system prompt.** Ensure it emphasizes generating a *solution*, not just evaluating one. The persona should actively "find a time," not just "verify." (From Iteration 4)
*   **Provide the LLM agent with the ability to perform numerical calculations and comparisons with the extracted schedule times.** (From Iteration 4)
*   **After implementing the solution generation, introduce a "best-of-n" solution approach to generate multiple schedules before providing the best one.** (From Iteration 4)
*   **Improve schedule and constraint extraction. The LLM prompt should be rewritten to make it more reliable.** (From Iteration 3)
*   **Refine `analyze_input` to provide more consistent extraction.** (From Iteration 3)
*   **Create a unit test suite to ensure that the correct routes are being followed by `dynamic_input_router`.** (From Iteration 3)
*   **Implement a more rigorous solution validation and refinement loop to address the invalid time-slot problem. The verifier agent must be better, potentially with more few-shot examples.** (From Iteration 3)
*   **Address the ReAct loop data handling:** Examine the `call_llm` function and the data transformation steps immediately after the call. Explicitly define the expected JSON schema. Debug why the values from `call_llm` cannot be unpacked as intended. Implement JSON verification and retries. (From Iteration 2)
*   **Refine the Information Extraction Prompts:** Provide the LLM with explicit instructions and examples for how to extract and format schedule information. Use few-shot examples to demonstrate the desired output structure for the schedule data (participant names, blocked time intervals as start and end times). (From Iteration 2)
*   **Verify Data Format Before Calculation:** Enforce a rigid time format that the LLM must return. Validate time formats immediately after information extraction. Retry extraction if the format doesn't match. Consider adding a dedicated verification agent that validates the extracted information before passing it to the scheduler. (From Iteration 2)
*   **Implement Constraint Satisfaction with a Hybrid Approach:** Instead of relying solely on the LLM to find a solution, extract the constraints with the LLM, then use a deterministic constraint satisfaction solver (e.g., a Python function) to find a valid meeting time. (From Iteration 2)
*   **Add Time Calculation Utilities:** Develop helper functions in Python to perform time arithmetic (adding/subtracting durations, comparing time intervals) to avoid having the LLM perform these operations. (From Iteration 2)
*   **Prioritize Schedule Verification Accuracy:** Implement a more robust and reliable method for comparing proposed time slots against participant schedules. In particular:
    *   Introduce Python-based functions to perform precise time comparisons and intersection checks.
    *   Store extracted data in a structured format (e.g., JSON) before verification.
    *   Re-prompt the verification step to reduce verbosity and directly output the valid proposed schedule.
    *   Add unit tests to specifically test different types of availability conflicts.
*   **Improve Information Extraction:**
    *   Introduce more few-shot examples in `extract_meeting_info` function to improve its ability to accurately and completely extract all constraints and scheduling information.
    *   Address the extraction of negative constraints like preferred days or hours.
    *   Implement a verification loop for `extract_meeting_info`. If `verify_and_refine` identifies a constraint violation due to missing information, feed this back to `extract_meeting_info` for another extraction attempt.
*   **Refine Time Availability Check:** Revise the logic used to compare proposed meeting times with participant schedules in the `analyze_constraints` and `verify_and_refine` functions.
*   **Implement Unit Tests:** Create targeted unit tests for the key components of the system to ensure more robust operation.
*   *Iteration 4 Addition:* Modify the `extract_meeting_info` function to more effectively handle the information extraction. Consider a more iterative approach, perhaps using the ReAct pattern to improve the information extraction capabilities.

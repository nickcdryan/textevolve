# Synthesized Learnings for Meeting Scheduling Task

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   The questions follow a template: An introduction setting the LLM as a meeting scheduling expert, followed by a "TASK:" description specifying meeting participants, duration, and time constraints. Then "Here are the existing schedules..." lists busy times for each participant, and any personal scheduling preferences. Finally a prompt to "Find a time that works..."
*   The format of the existing schedules is semi-structured, with participant names followed by "has meetings on [day] during [time ranges]". The time ranges are the crucial information but are presented as natural language, necessitating robust extraction. Example: "John has meetings on Monday from 9:00 to 11:00."
*   Participant schedules are provided in a semi-structured format ("Charles has no meetings the whole week.\nCheryl has blocked their calendar on..."). The blocking times are described using ranges which need to be parsed. The system has to correctly parse the days, times, and participants involved.
*   The questions explicitly state, "Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant." This suggests that the core challenge is efficiently *finding* that solution, not determining its feasibility.
*   The problems almost always have a feasible solution. The prompt explicitly states "Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant." This allows the system to focus on *finding* a solution rather than determining if one exists.
*   The complexity varies based on the number of participants, the length and number of schedule conflicts, and the specificity of time preferences (e.g., "before 11:00," "not on Thursday").
*   Schedules of participants are described textually with specific time ranges (e.g., "John has meetings on Monday from 9:00 to 11:00") instead of in an easily parsable format, making information extraction challenging.
*   The questions often include meeting time preferences (e.g., "John prefers morning meetings", "Douglas do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30"), increasing the complexity of constraint satisfaction. Example: "Billy would like to avoid more meetings on Monday after 15:30".
*   **Structured Input Format:** The questions follow a consistent template: a role-playing prompt, a task description, a list of participant schedules with busy slots, and a request to find a suitable meeting time. This structure allows for targeted information extraction.
*   **Explicit Constraints:** The schedules are explicitly listed as time intervals for each participant, providing clear constraints. The questions also include constraints related to preferred days/times. The time constraints are the core of the meeting scheduling problem. Example: "John has meetings on Monday from 9:00 to 11:00."
*   **Implied Constraints:** The constraint to find *a* working time (as opposed to *all* working times) and the statement that a solution *exists* simplifies the search, but does not mean that the meeting can be scheduled at just any time.
*   The questions are presented in a very structured format: role as meeting scheduler, context setting, task description, participant schedules, constraints, and request for a solution.
*   The core of each question involves parsing multiple participants' schedules which are expressed as time intervals on specific days.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   The decomposition of the problem into constraint extraction, time proposal, and verification is a sound overall strategy. It allows for specialized agents to focus on individual aspects of the problem.
*   **Promising Strategy:** Decomposing the problem into constraint extraction, time proposal, and solution verification shows promise, providing a structured approach to the scheduling task. Explicit constraint extraction helps make the scheduling decision explainable.
*   Using LLMs for individual extraction steps works in principle. In cases with simple inputs, the results have been very good.
*   **Reasonable Starting Point:** Using LLMs for constraint extraction and verification is a reasonable starting point since parsing the input schedules with traditional programming would be difficult.
*   **LLM-Driven Extraction:** The approach of using LLMs to extract meeting constraints is suitable given the relatively consistent format of the input questions. This is more robust than attempting to parse the text using regular expressions.
*   Providing explicit system instructions is helpful. It helps to guide the LLM toward producing the desired result.
*   Using few-shot examples to guide the LLM is also effective. It helps to provide context and structure for the LLM to follow.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** The chain of LLM calls is a good pattern: 1) extract constraints, 2) propose meeting time, 3) verify solution. It's advantageous to break down the problem into smaller, verifiable steps.
*   **Few-Shot Learning:** The use of few-shot examples in each function (`extract_meeting_constraints`, `propose_meeting_time`, and `verify_solution`) helps guide the LLM's reasoning and improve accuracy.
*   Using LLMs for all key agent roles (constraint extractor, time proposer, and solution verifier) with function calls works flawlessly.
*   Chain-of-thought prompting with few-shot examples successfully guides the LLM to find valid meeting times.
*   The modular structure with specific functions for constraint extraction, time proposal, and solution verification facilitates a clear workflow.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   The most critical failure mode (prior to iteration 4) was inaccurate analysis of participant availability. Specifically, `extract_meeting_constraints(question)` often misinterprets or incompletely extracts the blocked time slots from the provided schedules. This causes the `propose_meeting_time(constraints_json)` function to consider invalid time slots, leading to incorrect solutions.
*   The semi-structured format of the schedules is challenging for the LLM to parse correctly. The LLM sometimes misses constraints or misinterprets the time ranges, especially when multiple constraints are listed for a single participant.
*   **Constraint Violations:** The system fails when it does not adhere to all provided constraints when proposing a meeting time. The system proposes times that conflict with participant availability or specified preferences (e.g., proposing a meeting on a day the participant doesn't want to meet). This indicates a difficulty with constraint adherence.
*   **Inconsistent Negative Constraint Handling:** Inconsistent application of negative constraints (e.g. "Douglas do not want to meet on Monday after 13:30") and preferences suggests the LLM struggles with negative conditions and preferences.
*   **`find_available_slots` Function Failures:** The system fails to generate valid available time slots. This failure mode manifests as the system requesting available time slots from the user, indicating that the generated time slots are not valid or are empty, leading to process failure.
*   **JSON Parsing Errors:** The system fails to parse the JSON of the available time slots due to the invalid format generated by the process that determines available time slots. The error messages generated by the LLM are revealing, indicating that the input data is not in the expected format.
*   **Inaccurate Constraint Handling:** The system is making errors extracting the day or time of the meeting. If the extraction gets either of those incorrect, the rest of the process breaks down. Example: Incorrectly extracting "Monday" instead of "Tuesday."
*   **Incorrect Schedule Interpretation:** The system sometimes struggles to accurately interpret the schedules of all participants and misses busy slots when proposing a meeting time. It is likely missing individual constraints within the lists.
*   The LLM often fails to account for all constraints simultaneously. Even if individual constraints are extracted correctly, the `propose_meeting_time` function sometimes fails to find a time that satisfies *all* constraints for *all* participants. This indicates a limitation in the LLM's reasoning or a suboptimal prompt design. The LLM needs to focus not only on individual constraints, but the overlap between constraints.
*   **Preference Handling:** Preference Handling issues arise where the system ignores the stated preferences by Barbara to not meet on Tuesday, by giving Tuesday as a possible meeting time. This shows the system is missing one or more preferences.
*   The LLM uses natural language to explain its reasoning. This process is error-prone.
*   **Current Status:** With 1.0 accuracy in Iteration 4, there are currently *no observed failure modes* on the dataset. The current approach appears sufficient for the scope of test data.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   Accuracy: 0%
    *   The approach of combining LLM-based constraint extraction with code-based slot finding is fundamentally flawed.
    *   Using the LLM for extraction and verification seems valid, but the deterministic code for calculating available slots is problematic, given that the system is failing on extracting the slots and formatting the information.
*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   Accuracy: 60%
    *   The basic framework of constraint extraction, time proposal, and solution verification is functional, but not sufficiently reliable.
    *   The current LLM-driven approach to constraint extraction and time proposal is not sufficiently reliable for this task. The "verify_solution" stage is unable to consistently catch failures to adhere to constraints.
*   **Iteration 2:**
    *   Accuracy: 60%
    *   Exploitation strategy highlighted the importance of precise constraint handling.
    *   While the overall structure of the approach is sound, the LLM calls must be improved to extract and interpret the constraint information in a more robust and accurate way.
    *   The verification step does not catch the constraint failures, indicating that the `verify_solution` process is not as effective as it could be.
*   **Iteration 3:**
    *   Accuracy: 60%
    *   The decomposition of the problem into constraint extraction, time proposal, and verification is a sound overall strategy. It allows for specialized agents to focus on individual aspects of the problem.
    *   Using LLMs for individual extraction steps works in principle. In cases with simple inputs, the results have been very good.
    *   Providing explicit system instructions is helpful. It helps to guide the LLM toward producing the desired result.
    *   Using few-shot examples to guide the LLM is also effective. It helps to provide context and structure for the LLM to follow.
    *   The most critical failure mode is inaccurate analysis of participant availability. Specifically, `extract_meeting_constraints(question)` often misinterprets or incompletely extracts the blocked time slots from the provided schedules.

    *   The LLM uses natural language to explain its reasoning. This process is error-prone.
*   **Iteration 4:**
    *   Accuracy: 100%
    *   The exploitation strategy of using LLMs for all agent roles and few-shot examples confirmed that the system has reached a high level of reliability and accuracy for this specific dataset.
    *   The hypothesis that a clear chain-of-thought approach combined with dedicated roles leads to effective meeting scheduling is supported.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   Even with 1.0 accuracy, exploring edge cases and negative constraints may lead to better generalization.
*   In future iterations, stress test the boundaries of the system by increasing the number of participants, the complexity of their schedules, and adding more nuanced constraints to evaluate the system's robustness.
*   Introduce "trick" questions with impossible scenarios to verify that the system can correctly identify that a solution is not feasible.
*   Provide the `extract_meeting_constraints(question)` function with more, and more diverse, few-shot examples to improve its ability to parse the semi-structured schedule format. Vary the complexity of the schedules and the number of participants.
*   Consider a two-stage extraction process: first, extract all blocked time ranges for each participant, and then, in a separate step, combine those time ranges to find available slots. This may simplify the task for the LLM.
*   Experiment with different prompt formats for `extract_meeting_constraints(question)`. Try a more structured JSON output format with explicit fields for each participant and their blocked time ranges.
*   Refine the prompt for `propose_meeting_time(constraints_json)` to emphasize the need to consider *all* constraints simultaneously. Add examples that demonstrate how to find overlapping time slots that satisfy all participants.
*   Implement a verification loop within the `propose_meeting_time` function to check if the proposed time actually satisfies all constraints. If not, the LLM should re-propose a time.
*   Provide a more comprehensive verification prompt in `verify_solution(question, proposed_time)` that explicitly asks the LLM to double-check each constraint against the proposed meeting time.
*   If the verification step fails, provide specific feedback to the `propose_meeting_time` function about which constraints were violated, allowing it to learn from its mistakes.
*   Implement Explicit Constraint Checking: Implement an explicit constraint-checking function in code. This function would take the extracted constraints and a proposed time, verifying that the proposed time satisfies all constraints. If not, the LLM could be prompted again, or the code could iteratively test different valid times. This adds a deterministic verification layer to the LLM's output.
*   Refine Verification Prompt: Strengthen the verification prompt to explicitly focus on checking all constraints. The prompt should list each constraint and ask the LLM to confirm it's met by the proposed time.
*   Test with more complex questions: Introduce examples with a larger number of participants and more overlapping schedule conflicts to stress-test the system's ability to handle complexity. This will help identify scalability issues.
*   Add examples with preferences: Add examples with meeting time preferences (e.g., "John prefers morning meetings") to train the model to better handle these types of constraints.
*   Address `find_available_slots` Function: Focus on fixing the `find_available_slots` function. Add error handling and validation within this function to ensure it produces a correctly formatted JSON string of available time slots, even if the input busy times are imperfect. Alternatively, remove the code-based time slot finder and use LLM reasoning instead.
*   Implement "Plan B": Add a "Plan B" to the main workflow: If the LLM is unable to propose a meeting time due to invalid data, have it attempt to solve the problem directly from the original question, instead of failing.
*   Improve Logging: Add better logging of intermediate results (extracted constraints, calculated available slots) to facilitate debugging.
*   Refine `extract_meeting_constraints`:** Provide more few-shot examples that demonstrate complex scenarios with multiple participants, varied schedule formats, and specific time/day preferences. Focus on including examples that exhibit edge cases and negative constraints (e.g., "avoid Tuesday").
*   Enhance `verify_solution`:** Include more examples of error detection in `verify_solution`. Specifically, provide examples where a proposed time *violates* a constraint.
*   Multi-Agent Verification:** Create a separate "schedule checker" agent that independently verifies the extracted constraints against the proposed solution. The `verify_solution` agent should then compare the proposed time against the schedule checker results.
*   Constraint Highlighting:** Modify `extract_meeting_constraints` to explicitly list all constraints in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate the verification process.
*   Add explicit "reasoning" step before final proposal:** Before generating the final proposed meeting time, have the LLM explicitly state *why* the time works given *each participant's* availability. This could reveal misunderstanding before the solution is proposed.
*   Hybrid approach:**
    *   Use the LLM for parsing and extraction, but use traditional python logic to calculate the best meeting time.
    *   If that fails, the traditional approach can be used.

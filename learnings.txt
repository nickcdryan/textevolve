Okay, here's the updated, synthesized version of our learnings, focusing on the grid transformation dataset and task. This will serve as our evolving research log.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   **Grid-based Representation:** The dataset revolves around transforming numerical grids. The core problem lies in identifying the rules governing these transformations based on training examples.
*   **Consistent Question Structure:** All questions adhere to a rigid format: "Grid Transformation Task" title, "TRAINING EXAMPLES" section with "Input Grid" and "Output Grid" pairs, "TEST INPUT" section, and the prompt "Transform the test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples.".
*   **Answer Format:** Answers are always 2D arrays (grids) formatted as strings, representing the transformed test input.
*   **Data Representation:** The core data is embedded within the text as strings representing 2D numerical grids (lists of lists). Grids vary in size (rows and columns) and content (numerical range). Example values observed: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Grid sizes range from small 3x3 grids to larger 21x21 grids. Grids are typically 10x10 or larger in the most recent observations. Examples also include 4x4, 5x5 and 12x12 grids. In Iteration 13, varying and inconsistent sizes were observed, emphasizing the challenge of handling different dimensions.
*   **Training Examples:** Training examples consistently include 2-3 input-output grid pairs. The LLM is expected to infer the transformation rule from these examples. The effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality and diversity of these examples. The number of training examples provided can be limited (e.g., only 3 examples) making generalization difficult.
*   **Numerical Nature:** Grid elements are numerical, suggesting that transformations might involve arithmetic operations (including modular arithmetic), value comparisons, or state transitions.
*   **Grid Format:** The grids often have a border of repeating numbers (e.g., 8s or 4s) surrounding a central area with varying patterns.
*   **Localized Transformations:** The transformations often involve changing specific values within the grid based on their position relative to other numbers or patterns in the grid, implying spatial reasoning is crucial.
*   **Example-Based Learning:** The task revolves around applying patterns observed in training examples (input/output grid pairs) to a new test input grid.
*   **Value Propagation:** Solutions often involve identifying how specific values in the input grid propagate and influence other cells in the output grid.
*   **Transformation Logic:** The core of each problem is a hidden transformation rule that needs to be inferred from a limited number of training examples. These transformations can be complex and non-linear, involving arithmetic operations, pattern recognition, or spatial relationships between cells. Examples provided illustrate transformations involving modular arithmetic and relationships between neighboring cells. The complexity of the rule varies significantly across questions. Transformations seem to involve shifting, reflecting, or altering the values of elements based on their positions and neighboring elements.
*   **"Chain-of-Thought" Requirement:** The task implicitly demands a "chain-of-thought" approach. First, the transformation rule must be *extracted* from the examples. Second, that rule must be *applied* to the test input.
*   **Distinct Values:** Grids are represented as 2D arrays of integers, typically with a background value (often 0) and a few other distinct values that participate in the transformation. The dimensions of the grids vary.
*   **Output Grid Size Reduction:** Output grids can be smaller than input grids, which suggests that some form of summarization or compression is required as part of the transformation. This adds complexity to the rule extraction process.
*   **Key Structural Element:** The use of grids (2D arrays) containing numerical values, with '0' often representing an empty cell and other numbers representing states or elements to be transformed.
*   **Need for Abstract Reasoning:** The uniqueness of this task lies in the need to infer transformation rules from a limited number of examples and apply those rules to a novel grid, requiring abstract reasoning and pattern extrapolation.
*   **Symbolic Reasoning Required:** Successful transformation requires identifying patterns, relationships, and logical rules that govern how the grid elements change. This goes beyond simple pattern matching; it needs a level of symbolic reasoning about spatial relationships (e.g., elements near a specific number are changed).
*   **Block or Row Shifting:** The transformation often involves shifting blocks or rows containing specific numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 4) within the grid. The shifts are often vertical, moving blocks up or down.
*   **Positional Importance:** Position is important in relation to the changes made in the grid. The rules need to capture the spatial relationships between elements and transformations. Transformations can be related to diagonals in the image.
*   **Varied Transformation Types:** The nature of the rules isn't always clear (e.g., value mapping, mirroring, rotations, combinations, etc.). This ambiguity adds complexity to the task.
*   **Implicit Rules:** The transformation rules are not explicitly stated but must be inferred from the input-output grid pairs in the training examples. This requires pattern recognition capabilities.
*   **Diverse Grid Sizes and Arrangements:** In Iteration 13, it was observed that test cases can have drastically different dimensions and arrangements than the input cases, making generalization even more challenging.
*   **Non-Zero Value Extraction:** Some questions require extracting all non-zero values from input grids (Iteration 13).

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   **Potentially Effective (but needs refinement):** Decomposing the problem into rule extraction and application is a reasonable starting point, as it mirrors how humans might approach these puzzles. The initial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) attempt, while yielding low accuracy (0.67 in Iteration 1), suggests this decomposition is a viable direction, although it requires significant enhancement. *However, Iteration 4, 5, 6 and 7 and 9 suggests that the current spatial encoding and transformation prediction strategy is insufficient.*
*   **Potentially Effective (but needs refinement):** Decomposing the problem into rule extraction, rule application, and verification shows promise as a general framework. LLMs may be better at handling these sub-tasks individually compared to solving the entire problem at once. Iteration 8 confirms that this approach is promising. The 0.20 accuracy in Iteration 10 indicates that while the "rule extraction, application, and verification" approach is conceptually sound, its current implementation is significantly flawed and requires substantial improvement. The LLM needs much better guidance on the *types* of rules to consider (value mapping, geometric transformations, etc.). Iteration 13 showed that iterative refinement and constraint validation (while sound in principle) are not effectively implemented.
*   **Ineffective: Direct Exploitation (Few-Shot Learning Alone):** Simply providing training examples and prompting the LLM to transform the test grid has consistently failed. The LLM struggles to extract abstract rules from the examples. *Example:* Providing input-output pairs with element repetition or shifting patterns did not lead to correct transformations of the test input. Iteration 5, 6, 7 and 9 further confirm this with a 0.00 accuracy.
*   **Ineffective: Simple Chain-of-Thought:** Chain-of-thought prompting, while intended to guide the LLM through reasoning steps, isn't sufficient for spatial reasoning-based problems. The LLM may generate a logical-sounding explanation without actually capturing the geometric transformations at play.
*   **Ineffective: Role-Playing:** Simply designating the LLM as a "grid transformation expert" doesn't imbue it with the necessary skills to solve the problem. The LLM lacks the inherent understanding of spatial relationships and geometric patterns. The attempt at using the "expert" role resulted in 0/X correct answers in Iteration 2. Iteration 10 reinforces this finding, showing that the "expert" role doesn't translate into accurate solutions, suggesting the need for better prompting strategies or more specific constraints on the types of transformations to consider.
*   **Ineffective: LLM-Driven Rule Extraction (Hypothesis - Rejected):** The experimental approach attempts to leverage the LLM's ability to recognize patterns and infer rules from examples, but currently this is not working well, indicated by a low accuracy of 0.33 in Iteration 3 and 7. Generic LLM-driven chain-of-thought is *not* sufficient. *Iteration 4, 5 and 6 reinforces this, achieving 0% accuracy with a two-step LLM approach. Iteration 9 confirms the rejection of explicit rule extraction hypothesis.*
*   **Ineffective: Two-Step LLM Approach (Spatial Encoding + Transformation Prediction):** The two-step LLM approach of spatial encoding/transformation prediction followed by application failed completely, achieving 0% accuracy in Iteration 4, 5 and 6. The approach incorrectly hypothesized that LLMs are competent at grid transformations by merely providing examples. This strategy was tested in an exploration context.
*   **Ineffective: Current Exploitation Strategy (Iteration 6 & 7):** The exploitation strategy, relying solely on the LLM's ability to extract and apply rules, failed completely, similar to Iterations 0 and 5.
*   **Ineffective: Acting as a Grid Transformation Expert (Iteration 6):** The hypothesis that an LLM, with a suitable system instruction, could act as a grid transformation expert was rejected. The LLM struggles to abstract the rules effectively.
*   **Ineffective: Coordinate Analysis (Iteration 11):** Iteration 11 showed that the LLM continues to fail to apply the rules correctly with prompting for Coordinate Analysis. The accuracy was 0%.
*   **Ineffective: Chain-of-Thought (Iteration 12):** The chain-of-thought approach, while conceptually sound, is not effective for this dataset in its current implementation.
*   **Ineffective: Rule extraction, application, and verification (Iteration 12):** The current approach of rule extraction, application, and verification does not lead to good performance on this task. The hypothesis that the LLM can decompose and solve grid transformation problems in this manner is rejected.
*   **Ineffective: Iterative Refinement (Iteration 13):** The hypothesis that an LLM, through iterative refinement, can learn and apply grid transformation rules from limited examples is strongly rejected.

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **Rule Extraction Failure:** The LLM struggles to accurately extract the underlying transformation rule from the examples. The generated rules are often incomplete, incorrect, or too specific to the provided examples, leading to poor generalization. This is evident in the low accuracy scores across multiple iterations (especially Iterations 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13). The LLM struggles to consistently derive the transformation rules from the training examples, leading to incorrect or irrelevant rules being applied to the test input. In Iteration 13, the LLM failed to extract specific numbers from certain locations in the input grids and place them into an output grid of different dimensions.
*   **Inability to Generalize Transformation Rules:** The LLM struggles to extract abstract rules from the example grids. The system appears to fixate on superficial details rather than inferring the underlying logic. The primary failure is the model's inability to correctly generalize from the training examples to the test input. For example, it might identify that a '1' should be replaced by a '2' in certain contexts but fails to recognize the full spatial constraints or dependencies that define when and where the transformation applies. The provided error examples show the system often transforms *some* parts of the grid correctly, but the overall pattern is missed leading to a substantially different output than expected. Generalization remains a key challenge, especially when test input grid sizes differ (Iteration 13).
    *   *Example:* Provided examples showed failure to replicate simple patterns like element repetition or shifting.
*   **Literal Pattern Matching (Without Understanding Logic):** The LLM attempts direct pattern matching between the input and output grids of the training examples *without* understanding the underlying transformation logic. This results in brittle solutions that fail on the test input, even when the underlying pattern is similar. The model appears to be latching onto superficial similarities between the training examples and the test input, leading to incorrect transformations. Instead of grasping the underlying logic, it might simply copy a transformation that *looks* similar without understanding its full context. In example 2, the system almost seems to be applying a 'convolution' to apply surrounding elements to the target, but the parameters are incorrect leading to a wrong transformation.
*   **Incorrect Code Interpretation and Execution (If Coding is Involved):** When the LLM attempts to generate code to perform the transformation, the code often contains logical errors, leading to an incorrect transformed grid. The LLM often fails to produce executable code, outputting either raw code (unable to extract code with regular expressions) or providing an output that does not match the training data.
    *   *Example:* One failed attempt involved the LLM outputting a Python script that attempted to hardcode conditions based on grid position, rather than inferring the logic. Iteration 5 confirms this failure, with the system extracting elements from the input grid based on hardcoded indices (`grid[0][15]`, `grid[2][0]`) instead of identifying a generalizable transformation pattern.
*   **Ambiguity and Multiple Plausible Rules:** Multiple plausible transformation rules might fit the training examples, leading to incorrect predictions on the test input.
*   **Difficulty Handling Grid Size Variance:** The varying sizes of input and output grids make it difficult to develop a universal transformation algorithm.
*   **Representation Challenges:** Converting the textual representation into a data structure the LLM can easily manipulate *without* explicitly coding is difficult.
*   **Inaccurate Value Mapping:** The core failure is the inability to accurately determine the correct output values for specific locations in the test grid based on the training examples. The model struggles to discern *which* values should be replaced and *with what* other values. For example, in one failed example, the system incorrectly mapped some values to `8` and `3` when the target was `4`, `6` and `0`.
*   **Pattern Generalization (Complexity):** The system struggles with generalizing from the provided examples. The observed patterns are likely too complex for the LLM to extract reliably given the current prompting strategy and the limited number of examples.
*   **Lack of Spatial Reasoning:** The LLM struggles to abstract spatial relationships and apply transformation logic across the grid. For example, it fails to recognize that a value at a specific coordinate in the input grid might influence cells at a different coordinate in the output grid based on a learned pattern. The LLM seems to lack strong spatial reasoning capabilities, failing to correctly interpret and apply patterns involving relative positions of elements within the grid. Instead, the LLM attempts to address the question by hardcoding an answer (Iteration 12).
*   **Memorization vs. Generalization:** The LLM tends to memorize specific input-output grid layouts from training examples rather than generalizing the underlying transformation rules. This leads to incorrect transformations on unseen test inputs. The LLM-based approach struggles to generalize beyond the provided training examples, leading to hardcoded transformations that fail on the test input (Iteration 12).
*   **Difficulty with Complex Patterns:** The dataset contains complex patterns involving value propagation, mirroring, or rotations within the grid. The LLM struggles to decode these patterns and apply them to the test grid.
*   **Insufficient Training Examples:** The limited number of training examples (often only 3-4) may not be sufficient for the LLM to generalize the underlying transformation logic (Iteration 3).
*   **Pattern Recognition Failure:** The LLM struggles to identify and extrapolate the correct transformation pattern from the training examples. The identified pattern is either incorrect or nonexistent (Iteration 4).
*   **Spatial Misinterpretation:** The LLM fails to accurately map the elements and their relationships within the grid, leading to errors in transformation application. The spatial encoding and transformation prediction strategy proved insufficient (Iteration 4).
*   **Generalization Failure:** Even when the LLM identifies a pattern in the training examples, it struggles to generalize it to the test input. The transformation rules extracted are often too specific to the training data, failing to adapt to different grid sizes or arrangements. *Example*: The system answer and golden answer's numbers within the nested arrays differ significantly, and the arrangement of these numbers is also different (Iteration 5).
*   **Incorrect Value Propagation (Iteration 6):** The system fails to correctly propagate transformed values throughout the grid. The system may only process the first non-zero value in each row, which contradicts the problem description that suggests transformations are based on *all* non-zero values.
*   **Faulty Adjacency Logic (Iteration 6):** The system demonstrates flawed logic when dealing with adjacency-based transformations. The system attempts to extend pairs of values, but does so incorrectly compared to the expected output, indicating a failure to understand and implement the correct adjacency rules from training.
*   **Misinterpretation of Transformation Rules (Iteration 6):** The system often infers transformation rules that are different from the ones demonstrated in the training examples. The generated answer doesn't convey the same information as the expected output.
*   **Superficial Pattern Matching:** The model appears to be latching onto superficial similarities between the training examples and the test input, leading to incorrect transformations. Instead of grasping the underlying logic, it might simply copy a transformation that *looks* similar without understanding its full context.
*   **Limited Contextual Understanding:** The LLM struggles to understand the spatial relationships within the grid and how these relationships influence the transformation rules. For instance, in the provided samples, transformations often depend on the proximity of certain numbers or the overall structure of the grid. The system often overlooks these contextual cues.
*   **Inaccurate Shifting Implementation:** The primary failure stems from the **inaccurate implementation of shifting logic.** The LLM identifies the correct *type* of transformation (e.g., shifting a block of '2's) but fails to execute this transformation *precisely*. The resulting grid has elements in incorrect locations. (Iteration 8)
*   **Incorrect Source/Destination Positions:** The LLM struggles with correctly discerning the source and destination positions of shifted blocks. For instance, in the provided error example, the system misplaces the '2' and '4' values during the vertical shift operation. (Iteration 8)
*   **Boundary Condition Neglect:** The system fails to account for boundary conditions when shifting. The system doesn't understand how values should wrap or be discarded when shifted past the grid's edges, leading to misplacement. (Iteration 8)
*    **Positional Understanding:** The LLM fails to fully understand the importance of position in relation to the changes made in the grid. The rules are not capturing the spatial relationships between elements and transformations. For example, in one failed example, the LLM couldn't identify that the modifications were related to the diagonals in the image (Iteration 9).
*   **Value-Specific Overfitting:** The LLM might be overfitting to the specific numerical values present in the training examples, rather than understanding the broader pattern. For example, in one failure, certain '4' and '9' values were not properly moved from input to output, suggesting a potential value-specific instead of pattern specific issue (Iteration 9).
*   **Incorrect Rule Application:** Even when a rule *is* extracted, the LLM struggles to correctly apply it to the test input, often resulting in nonsensical output grids (Iteration 10).
*   **Inconsistent Code Output Execution**: The LLM often fails to produce executable code, outputting either raw code (unable to extract code with regular expressions) or providing an output that does not match the training data (Iteration 10).
*   **Inadequate Pattern Generalization (Iteration 11):** The LLM fails to generalize the transformation rules effectively from the training examples to the test input, even with coordinate analysis prompts. For example, incorrectly replicating patterns onto the test grid and misunderstanding the underlying pattern's constraints.
*   **Spatial Relationship Misinterpretation (Iteration 11):** The LLM struggles to accurately interpret spatial relationships within the grid. As seen in the failure examples, the transformed grid produced by the system bears little resemblance to the expected output. The incorrect placement of values indicates a failure to capture the correct positional dependencies that define the transformation.
*   **Value Substitution Errors (Iteration 11):** The LLM incorrectly substitutes values, leading to deviations from the expected output. The presence of incorrect values in the system's answer when it should be different, indicating a flawed understanding of value substitution rules.
*   **Incorrect Offset Calculation (Iteration 12):** The system struggles with determining the correct spatial offsets for applying the transformation rule. This results in elements being placed in the wrong locations in the output grid. This is illustrated in the third failure example where the LLM attempts to apply offsets specific to the numbers 3 and 8, without understanding the underlying spatial relationship.
*   **Output Formatting Failure (Iteration 13):** The LLM struggles to generate the correct output format, often producing code implementations or outputting grids with incorrect dimensions or formatting (e.g., wrapping output grids with quotations when they are not expected).
*    **Failure to Identify the Relationship Between Input and Output Grid Dimensions (Iteration 13):** The LLM often has trouble discerning the mapping between the different input and output grids and struggles to produce the correct transformation.

**4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS**

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   **Strategy:** Direct exploitation; providing examples and prompting the LLM to transform the test grid.
    *   **Result:** 0/X correct answers (where X is the number of attempted questions).
    *   **Finding:** The "exploitation" strategy, relying solely on providing examples and prompting the LLM to transform the test grid, is insufficient for this dataset. This suggests that simply providing examples is not enough to enable the LLM to accurately identify and apply the underlying transformation rules.
    *   **Error:** The system failed to replicate simple patterns like element repetition or shifting, indicating an inability to generalize. Some attempts yielded Python code with hardcoded conditions based on grid position instead of inferred logic.
*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   **Strategy:** Simple Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Decompose the problem into rule extraction and application.
    *   **Result:** Achieved modest accuracy (0.67), indicating the strategy is a viable starting point but needs significant refinement.
    *   **Finding:** The raw pixel input combined with a simple text prompt is insufficient for the LLM to robustly understand and replicate grid transformation patterns.
    *   **Error:** The primary error lies in inaccurate value mapping within the grid. The model struggles to discern *which* values should be replaced and *with what* other values. In the provided failed example, the system incorrectly mapped some values to `8` and `3` when the target was `4`, `6` and `0`. The system seems to struggle with generalizing from the provided examples because the patterns are likely too complex for the LLM to extract reliably given the current prompting strategy and the limited number of examples.
*   **Iteration 2:**
    *   **Strategy:** Simple Chain-of-Thought with an "Expert" Role-Playing Prompt.
    *   **Result:** 0/X correct answers.
    *   **Finding:** Chain-of-thought prompting, while intended to guide the LLM through reasoning steps, isn't sufficient for spatial reasoning-based problems. Simply designating the LLM as a "grid transformation expert" doesn't imbue it with the necessary skills to solve the problem.
    *   **Error:** The LLM may generate a logical-sounding explanation without actually capturing the geometric transformations at play. The LLM lacks the inherent understanding of spatial relationships and geometric patterns, and thus provides incorrect answers despite the chain of thought.
*   **Iteration 3:**
    *   **Strategy:** Chain of Thought (CoT): Decompose the problem into rule extraction and application.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy of 0.33.
    *   **Finding:** The experiment, in its current form, rejects the hypothesis that a generic LLM-driven chain-of-thought approach is sufficient for solving these grid transformation problems. The LLM, despite its capabilities, struggles to extract and apply the complex rules effectively.
    *   **Error:** Incorrect rule extraction from training examples, likely due to insufficient examples to constrain the solution space and complexity of transformations.
*   **Iteration 4:**
    *   **Strategy:** Two-Step LLM Approach: 1) Spatial encoding/transformation prediction 2) Applying the transformation.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** A direct, LLM-driven transformation prediction method, even with prior spatial encoding, fails entirely.
    *   **Error:** The LLM fails in both identifying the correct pattern and in accurately mapping elements within the grid during transformation. This highlights the difficulty LLMs face with spatial reasoning and complex pattern recognition in this task.
*   **Iteration 5:**
    *   **Strategy:** Direct exploitation; providing examples and prompting the LLM to transform the test grid. (Reiteration of Iteration 0, to confirm previous findings).
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The attempt to directly exploit learned rules from the training examples resulted in complete failure. The two-step approach (rule extraction and application) is fundamentally flawed if the initial rule extraction is inaccurate. The current prompting strategy and LLM capabilities are insufficient for the complexity of the grid transformations in this dataset.
    *   **Error:** The LLM fails to accurately identify the underlying transformation rule from the training examples, resulting in code that extracts seemingly random elements or performs incorrect manipulations. Even when the LLM identifies a pattern in the training examples, it struggles to generalize it to the test input. The transformation rules extracted are often too specific to the training data, failing to adapt to different grid sizes or arrangements. *Example*: The system extracts elements from the input grid based on hardcoded indices (`grid[0][15]`, `grid[2][0]`) instead of identifying a generalizable transformation pattern. Also, the system answer and golden answer's numbers within the nested arrays differ significantly, and the arrangement of these numbers is also different.
*   **Iteration 6:**
    *   **Strategy:** Direct exploitation; providing examples and prompting the LLM to transform the test grid.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The attempt to directly exploit learned rules from the training examples resulted in complete failure, similar to Iterations 0 and 5. The hypothesis that an LLM, with a suitable system instruction, could act as a grid transformation expert was rejected.
    *   **Error:** The system fails to correctly propagate transformed values throughout the grid, demonstrating flawed logic when dealing with adjacency-based transformations. The system often infers transformation rules that are different from the ones demonstrated in the training examples.
*   **Iteration 7:**
    *   **Strategy:** Direct exploitation; providing examples and prompting the LLM to transform the test grid.
    *   **Result:** 0.33 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The "exploitation" strategy, which relies on extracting rules and applying them, is fundamentally failing. The system_instruction is not able to correctly guide the LLM to come up with the appropriate rules for grid transformation.
    *   **Error:** The LLM's inability to correctly generalize from the training examples to the test input. The system often transforms *some* parts of the grid correctly, but the overall pattern is missed leading to a substantially different output than expected.
*   **Iteration 8:**
    *   **Strategy:** Rule extraction, rule application, and verification.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy of 0.67.
    *   **Finding:** The experiment confirms that LLMs can identify grid transformation patterns from limited examples. However, they struggle to translate these patterns into precise grid manipulation instructions. The "rule extraction, rule application, and verification" approach is promising but needs significant refinement in the rule application stage.
    *   **Error:** The primary failure stems from the inaccurate implementation of shifting logic. The LLM identifies the correct *type* of transformation (e.g., shifting a block of '2's) but fails to execute this transformation *precisely*. The resulting grid has elements in incorrect locations. The system struggles with correctly discerning the source and destination positions of shifted blocks and fails to account for boundary conditions when shifting.
*   **Iteration 9:**
    *   **Strategy:** Direct exploitation; providing examples and prompting the LLM to transform the test grid.
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The 0.00 accuracy clearly rejects the hypothesis that a simple, two-step LLM-driven approach can reliably extract and apply grid transformation rules, at least with the current prompt design and model parameters. The LLM's ability to generalize is severely limited.
    *   **Error:** The LLM fails to fully understand the importance of position in relation to the changes made in the grid and might be overfitting to the specific numerical values present in the training examples, rather than understanding the broader pattern. For example, in one failure, the LLM couldn't identify that the modifications were related to the diagonals in the image and certain '4' and '9' values were not properly moved from input to output, suggesting a potential value-specific instead of pattern specific issue.
*   **Iteration 10:**
    *   **Strategy:** Rule extraction, application, and verification (Chain-of-thought approach).
    *   **Result:** 0.20 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The 0.20 accuracy indicates a significant failure in understanding and applying grid transformation logic. The chain-of-thought approach, while promising in theory, requires much better implementation to address rule extraction and application inconsistencies. The LLM's "expert" role in identifying grid transformation patterns did not translate into accurate solutions.
    *   **Error:** The LLM struggles to consistently derive the transformation rules from the training examples. This leads to incorrect or irrelevant rules being applied to the test input. Even when a rule is extracted, the LLM struggles to correctly apply it to the test input, often resulting in nonsensical output grids. The LLM often fails to produce executable code, outputting either raw code (unable to extract code with regular expressions) or providing an output that does not match the training data.
*   **Iteration 11:**
    *   **Strategy:** Rule extraction with prompts for Coordinate Analysis and Value substitution.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** Coordinate Analysis and explicit prompting for value substitution did not improve the LLM's performance, suggesting more fundamental issues with pattern recognition and spatial reasoning on this dataset. The system continues to fail at translating training examples into a correct transformation.
    *   **Error:** Inadequate Pattern Generalization, Spatial Relationship Misinterpretation, and Value Substitution Errors persist.
*   **Iteration 12:**
    *   **Strategy:** Chain-of-thought: Rule extraction, application, and verification.
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The chain-of-thought approach, in its current implementation, is not effective for this dataset. The LLM struggles to extract robust, generalizable rules from the provided examples.The hypothesis that the LLM can decompose and solve grid transformation problems in this manner is rejected.
    *   **Error:** Overfitting to Training Examples, Incorrect Offset Calculation, and Lack of Spatial Reasoning. The LLM seems to lack strong spatial reasoning capabilities, failing to correctly interpret and apply patterns involving relative positions of elements within the grid. Instead, the LLM attempts to address the question by hardcoding an answer.
*   **Iteration 13:**
    *   **Strategy:** Iterative Refinement with Constraint Validation.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis that an LLM, through iterative refinement, can learn and apply grid transformation rules from limited examples is strongly rejected in this iteration. The combination of complex spatial reasoning, diverse grid sizes, and limited training data proves too challenging.
    *   **Error:** The LLM failed to accurately identify the transformation rule from the training examples, struggled to generalize the learned rule to the test input, and often outputted code implementations or grids with incorrect formatting and dimensions. The LLM also often failed to identify the correct mapping of input grid dimensions to output grid dimensions.

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

*   **Prompt Engineering Focus:** Drastically revise the prompt engineering to explicitly guide the LLM to focus on identifying:
    *   The *relationship* between input and output grid dimensions.
    *   The *mapping* of values from specific locations in the input to locations in the output.
    *   The specific types of numbers to expect in the input grids.
    *   The format of the resulting output grids.
*   **Constrain Output Format:** Add explicit instructions to constrain the LLM to output *only* the transformed grid in the exact format expected. Avoid code implementations.
*   **Data Augmentation:** Explore techniques to augment the training data. This could involve creating synthetic examples with variations in grid size, element values, and transformation rules.
*   **Simplified Rule Space:** If possible, restrict the complexity of the transformation rules to make the problem more tractable.
*   **Explicit Rule Validation:** Implement a more robust rule validation step. This could involve defining a set of test cases (beyond the training examples) to explicitly evaluate the learned rule.
*   **Evaluate Zero-Shot Performance:** Before iterative refinement, assess the LLM's zero-shot performance on a holdout set to better understand its inherent capabilities.
*   **Improve Rule Extraction:** Refine the prompts to the LLM for rule extraction to emphasize spatial relationships and general patterns rather than specific values. Encourage the LLM to explain its reasoning for identifying the transformation rule.
*   **Implement a more structured rule extraction process:** Instead of relying on the LLM to "intuitively" extract rules, guide it with specific questions about the transformation. For example: "Are values being mapped to other values? Is there a rotation or mirroring? Is a subgrid being extracted?"
*   **Implement a validation step:** After applying a rule, have the LLM validate if the transformation seems reasonable given the training examples.
*   **Test different prompting strategies:** Explore different prompt phrasing and levels of detail to guide the LLM toward more accurate rule extraction and application.
*   **Implement more parsing on the LLM output**: The response from the LLM must be executable code to properly evaluate the logic.
*   **Refine Prompting Strategy:**  Modify the prompting strategy to encourage the LLM to focus on spatial relationships and positional dependencies within the grids. Instead of asking "What is the general rule?", try "How does the position of a number in the input grid affect its transformation in the output grid?".
*   **Improve Rule Extraction Prompting:** Refine the system instruction to emphasize the need for identifying *spatial relationships* and *contextual dependencies* when extracting transformation rules. Provide specific keywords or examples in the prompt that guide the LLM to focus on these aspects.
*   **Incorporate Explicit Rule Definitions:** Develop a method to extract explicit, formalized rules from the training examples *before* attempting the transformation. This could involve identifying key elements, adjacency patterns, and propagation rules and representing them in a structured format.
*   **Introduce Constraints and Edge-Case Handling:** Explicitly define constraints on transformation rules and edge cases that the LLM might miss during abstraction. For example, clarify how transformations should behave at grid boundaries or when conflicting patterns exist.
*   **Refine System Instruction:** The system instruction needs to guide the LLM towards more accurate pattern recognition and rule extraction. Specifically, it needs to emphasize the importance of considering all elements in the grid and correctly applying adjacency rules.
*   **Implement Verification Step:** The generated answer should be validated against the training examples to ensure it adheres to the transformation rules observed in training. For example, checking for number of specific values after transformation.
*   **Focus on explicit transformation description:** Instead of relying solely on example-based learning, provide the LLM with explicit instructions on possible transformation types (e.g., mirroring, rotation, value replacement, or combinations of these).
*   **Incorporate Spatial Reasoning:** Explore methods to explicitly represent spatial relationships within the grid, such as relative positions, neighborhoods, or symmetry. This might involve pre-processing the grid data or using specialized prompting techniques.
*   **Implement Evaluation Metrics in the Loop:** Instead of just extracting a rule and blindly applying it, try to get the LLM to predict a smaller part of the grid first, evaluate it against some internal consistency metrics, and then decide whether to proceed.
*   **Break Down Complexity:** If the LLM struggles with the entire transformation, decompose it into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. For instance, identify key features, then transform these features, and finally reconstruct the output grid.
*   **Implement a pattern verification loop:** Develop a more robust verification mechanism that checks the predicted transformation against multiple training examples to confirm consistency. This could involve a separate LLM verifier or a set of programmed rules.
*   **Experiment with different spatial encoding methods:** Explore alternative ways to represent the grid data spatially, such as coordinate systems or relative positioning, to improve the LLM's understanding of the grid structure. This may involve breaking down problems to a series of simpler LLM instructions.
*   **Explicit Rule Extraction Before Application:** Instead of relying solely on implicit learning from examples, explicitly prompt the LLM to first describe the transformation rule in

I'm a bit concerned because I think the graphics card might be defective.\\n\\nI've only had it for a few months, and I've been experiencing some pretty severe graphical glitches and crashes while gaming. It started subtly, with just occasional flickering, but now it's happening constantly, even with games that aren't particularly demanding. I've tried updating the drivers, even rolling back to older versions, but nothing seems to fix it.\\n\\nGiven the price of this PC (and the fact that I'm a VIP customer, I think!), I was really expecting a much better experience. I'm worried that the graphics card is faulty. Could you please advise on how to proceed? I'm hoping this is covered under warranty. I'd really appreciate a quick response as this is impacting my ability to use the PC at all.\\n\\nThanks,\\nDavid Wilson\",\n  \"sender_phone\": \"+1-555-9012\"\n}",

It fails to recognize how the grid dimensions in the training data influence the expected output grid dimensions for the test input. It also doesn't correctly pick out the correct values."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 6,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the **failure to correctly generalize transformation patterns from training examples to novel test inputs**. The system relies too much on memorizing specific examples and not enough on abstracting the underlying rules governing the transformations."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 7,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's inability to accurately identify and generalize the grid transformation patterns from the training examples. This leads to the application of incorrect transformation logic on the test input. Specifically, the system is often extracting subgrids instead of creating borders around specific numbers."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 8,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the **unreliable application of learned transformations to the test input**. The system's pattern recognition is often adequate, but it fails to consistently generate output grids that conform to the identified transformation rules. This stems from a weak connection between the pattern analysis phase and the output generation phase."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 9,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the **inability to generalize grid transformation rules** from the training examples. The system either fails to identify the underlying pattern or cannot adapt the learned pattern to new input grids with different dimensions or element distributions."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 10,
    "issue": "The system's core issue is its inability to accurately generalize the transformation logic from the training examples to the test input. It seems to either misinterpret the pattern or incorrectly apply it to the test input, leading to mismatched values in the output grid."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 11,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the inaccurate application of learned grid transformation patterns to unseen inputs. This suggests a flaw in the pattern recognition, abstraction, or generalization capabilities of the system."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 12,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's inability to access the designated 'gemini-pro' LLM, leading to a complete failure to generate any output. This could stem from incorrect API configuration, an unavailable model, or network connectivity problems."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 13,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's inability to learn and generalize complex transformation rules from the training examples. It is overfitting to simple, superficial patterns rather than understanding the underlying logic. The complexity of the rule is non-trivial, and requires an approach better suited to abstract rule extraction."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 14,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's **failure to develop a robust and generalizable understanding of the grid transformation logic.** The current approach seems to rely on memorizing specific patterns from the training examples rather than learning underlying rules and constraints. The pattern matching is too fragile and does not handle variations in input grid configurations effectively."
  }
]

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Introduce Output Validation:** Before presenting the output, validate that it matches the transformation rules in terms of element placement, zero placement, and grid size. If it doesn't, flag the output as invalid and attempt to generate a corrected output.",
  "Use data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the system's ability to generalize. For grid problems, this could involve rotating, flipping, or scaling the grids.",
  "Add Unit Tests:** Develop a set of unit tests to verify that the transformation function correctly applies the transformation rules for various input grids and patterns.",
  "Add print statements to the generated code to print intermediate outputs for each step, so you can better see how the data changes as its being processed. For example you could print(output_grid) inside of the loops where the transformations are happening.",
  "Focus on improving the system's understanding of spatial relationships and how these relationships can be represented in code. Consider using techniques like graph neural networks to model the grid structures and their transformations.",
  "Introduce a code verification step to ensure that the generated code aligns with the intended transformation logic. This could involve running the generated code on a small set of validation inputs and comparing the outputs with expected results.",
  "Implement a more advanced pattern recognition algorithm capable of identifying complex relationships between input and output grids.",
  "Implement Transformation Function:** Create a dedicated function that takes the input grid and transformation rules as input and generates the output grid.",
  "Formalize Transformation Rules:** Explicitly define the transformation rules (e.g., \"move all non-zero elements from the first row to the last row\") in a structured format.",
  "Debugging Tools:** Include print statements and intermediate outputs to show the transformation rules identified, and what calculations are being performed at each step of the process."

    Problem:
    Design a data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:
    1. Insert a value
    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓
    2. Delete operation: The solution uses the hashmap to find the index, then swaps with the last element and updates accordingly with O(1) time complexity ✓
    3. Get random operation: The solution generates a random index within the array bounds with O(1) time complexity ✓
    4. All operations have O(1) average time complexity ✓
    
    Result: VALID - The solution correctly addresses all requirements with the specified time complexity.

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

                        return {
                            "is_valid": False,
                            "validation_feedback": f"Error during processing: {str(e)}"
                        }

            return {
                "is_valid": False,
                "validation_feedback": "Failed to extract valid entities after multiple attempts."
            }
        ```

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

        

            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, I've synthesized the existing knowledge with the new learnings from Iteration 14, focusing on the Grid Transformation Task dataset. This log emphasizes concrete, task-specific insights to guide future experiments and prevent repeating past errors, while staying within the token limits.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   **Question Format:** Tasks are presented as "Grid Transformation Tasks." Each task includes "TRAINING EXAMPLES" (input/output grid pairs) and a "TEST INPUT" grid. The objective is to generate the "OUTPUT GRID" for the test input, following patterns from the training examples.
*   **Consistent Structure:** Questions follow a consistent structure: a "Grid Transformation Task" header, "TRAINING EXAMPLES" with Input/Output grid pairs, a "TEST INPUT" grid, and an instruction to transform the test input.
*   **Grid Representation:** Grids are represented as nested lists of integers (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`). Grid dimensions (rows and columns) vary between examples and even within a single example (input vs. output). Grids are typically small matrices of integers, often with a background value (e.g., 0) and a few other distinct values that participate in the transformation rules.
*   **Mixed Element Types:** Grids often contain a mix of elements, including zeros and other numerical values.
*   **Training Examples followed by Test Input:** Each problem is structured with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" showing input-output pairs, followed by a "TEST INPUT" for which the transformed grid must be generated.
*   **Transformation Logic:** The core challenge is identifying the transformation logic. This logic can involve:
    *   Expansion, substitution, mirroring, replication of rows/columns, shifting values, replacing values based on surrounding cells, and combinations of these.
    *   Spatial relationships between numbers (e.g., a cell's value depends on its neighbors). The rules are often *localized* to the vicinity of a cell, or, conversely, depend on characteristics of a subgrid. Spatial reasoning is often required.
    *   Numerical transformations (e.g., adding a constant to each cell).
    *   Combinations of spatial and numerical transformations. The transformations can be complex and context-dependent, applying differently based on the location or the neighboring elements of an element.
    *   Transformations can involve replacing elements with new values based on their original value and location, and introducing new non-zero values to previously zeroed cells.
    *   Transformations often involve changing specific numbers within the grid based on their position or surrounding numbers. Patterns can include adding/removing a number from a specific location.
    *   Dimensionality changes are common between input and output grids, implying the system must infer resizing or cropping operations. The size of the grid is not consistent across different examples, or even within examples in a question, posing a challenge.
    *   Transformations often involve identifying specific numbers or patterns within the grid and then applying a change based on their location or relationship to other elements. The complexity lies in discerning the exact transformation rule from a limited number of examples.
    *   A key characteristic is the presence of patterns relating the input and output grids, which involve moving, shifting, or transforming numbers within the grid.
    *   Grid reduction and value extraction are also possible transformations. Transformations can even collapse a large grid to a single element.
*   **Implicit Rules:** Transformation logic is *never* explicitly stated. The LLM must infer the rules from limited training examples.
*   **Abstract Rules:** The underlying transformation rules are abstract and not immediately obvious. They can involve changes to specific numbers, their locations relative to other numbers, or based on other complex patterns in the grid. The challenges lie in deciphering abstract patterns and generalizing rules beyond the provided examples.
*   **Few-Shot Learning Format:** Questions are presented in a few-shot format, including multiple training examples (input/output grid pairs) followed by a test input grid. The task is to infer the transformation rule from the training examples and apply it to the test input. The success of this approach depends heavily on the quality and consistency of the training examples provided.
*   **Varying Grid Sizes:** Transformations might be size-dependent.
*   **Multiple Possible Rules:** Different transformations might yield similar results on the training data but diverge on the test data.
*   **Value Dependencies:** A cell's new value may depend on multiple other cells.
*   **Asymmetric Transformations:** The transformation might not be symmetrical across the grid.
*   **Value Encoding:** Specific values within the grids (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9) have semantic meaning related to the transformation. The model must learn these encodings. The system seems to assign arbitrary significance to specific numbers within the grid.
*   **Element Distribution:** The approach fails when faced with new input grids that have different element distributions compared to the training examples.
*   **Small integer matrices:** The grids are typically small matrices of integers, often with a background value (e.g., 0) and a few other distinct values that participate in the transformation rules.

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   **LLM-based Visual Feature Analysis (Potentially Useful):** Using an LLM to analyze the visual features and infer transformation rules is a promising approach, but generalization remains a major challenge.
*   **Two-Step LLM Approach (Potentially Useful):** The two-step LLM approach (analyze then apply) shows some promise, but is still insufficient for reliable generalization.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Specialized Agents (Inconsistent):** The chain-of-thought approach, with specialized expert agents for visual feature analysis and transformation application, shows promise but suffers from inconsistent performance due to the LLM's issues with generalization.
*   **Decomposition (Helpful):** Breaking down the problem into analyzing visual features and applying the transformation simplifies the task.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Multi-Example Prompts (Helpful):** Chain-of-thought prompting with multi-example prompts has been helpful in guiding the LLM to recognize patterns, but improvements are needed.
*   **Analogical Reasoning (Potentially Useful):** The analogical reasoning approach demonstrates potential in pattern recognition, but has not achieved high accuracy.
*   **Proper API Configuration (Critical):** API configuration is paramount for any LLM-based strategy to function. The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable must be correctly set, and the chosen LLM model (e.g., 'gemini-pro') must be accessible.

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **LLM Access Failure:** The system's inability to access the designated LLM (e.g., 'gemini-pro'), leading to a complete failure to generate any output. This can be due to incorrect API key configuration, unavailability of the model, or network connectivity issues. *Example: Iteration 12.*
*   **API Key Configuration Issues:** Incorrectly setting or failing to retrieve the API key from the environment (e.g., the environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) prevents the system from accessing the LLM. *Example: Iteration 12.*
*   **Over-Reliance on Memorization:** The LLM seems to memorize training examples rather than generalizing the transformation logic. This leads to failures when the test input deviates even slightly from the training data. For example, if the training examples all show a specific pattern with the number '8', the system might incorrectly apply that pattern to the test input, even if the underlying transformation rule is different.
*   **Inability to Abstract Complex Rules:** The dataset requires the abstraction of non-linear relationships and contextual dependencies within the grid. The system struggles with tasks where the transformation involves more than simple element-wise replacement or where the output grid has a significantly different structure than the input grids.
*   **Inaccurate Pattern Generalization:** The primary failure lies in the LLM's inability to generalize the transformation rule from the training examples to the test input. *Example: All Iteration 0 through Iteration 10 errors.* The LLM demonstrates *poor generalization* from the training examples, failing to extrapolate transformation rules when the test input differs even slightly from the training set.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Generalization:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation patterns from the training examples. This leads to the application of incorrect rules to the test input. For example, it might misinterpret a spatial relationship or a value-based trigger for a transformation.
*   **Pattern Misinterpretation:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation logic from the training examples. For example, it may not recognize that the transformation is based on subgrid maximums or spatial relationships.
*   **Inability to abstract general rules:** The model fails to generalize from the limited examples to novel test inputs. It appears to memorize patterns but struggles to understand the underlying logic of the transformations.
*   **Incorrect Application:** Even when the LLM correctly identifies the transformation, it struggles to apply it to the test input. This can involve errors in indexing, calculations, or general logic. (Iteration 10)
*   **Lack of Spatial Precision:** LLMs sometimes struggle with precise spatial relationships within the grid. The system struggles to place transformed elements in the correct positions within the output grid, suggesting a weakness in understanding and applying the spatial logic of the transformation.
*   **Dimensionality Mismatch:** The LLM generates output grids with incorrect dimensions compared to the expected output grid. This suggests a failure to understand how input grid dimensions influence output grid dimensions. *Example: Iteration 0, Example 2; Iteration 5, Example 1.*
*   **Shape and Dimensionality Errors:** The generated output grids often have incorrect shapes or dimensions compared to the expected output. This indicates a failure in understanding how the transformations affect the overall grid structure, or simply a failure in array construction in the generation stage.
*   **Output Format Mismatch:** The generated output grid does not match the size or shape expected by the golden answer, even if the values have some correctness, indicating the transformation application is incorrect. (Iteration 10) Incorrect output format, specifically the structure of the generated grid, causes failures.
*   **Incorrect Value Mapping:** Even when the dimensions are correct, the LLM fails to map values correctly. The numerical relationships between corresponding cells in the input and output grids are not accurately learned and applied. *Example: Iteration 0, Example 3; Iteration 5, Examples 2 and 3.*
*   **Incorrect Element Replacement:** In one failure case (Iteration 14), the system outputted an array filled with the number 4 when the correct answer was an array filled with the number 6, indicating that the system might be identifying the correct structure, but using the wrong numbers.
*   **Value Errors:** The system generates grids containing numbers not present in the target grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** The LLM outputs the response as a string containing Python code that *would* define the output grid, rather than directly outputting the grid.
*   **Ambiguity:** The transformations are implicit and can be interpreted in multiple ways from just a few examples.
*   **Complexity:** The underlying transformations might be complex involving combinations of replication, shifting, value changes, and so on.
*   **Inability to Extract Accurate Transformation Rules:** The system consistently fails to extract accurate and generalizable transformation rules from the training examples.
*   **Fragility of Pattern Recognition:** The system's pattern recognition approach is fragile and easily disrupted by small variations in the input grids.
*   **Lack of Rule Validation:** The system's rule validation process is not robust enough to catch inaccurate or incomplete rules.
*   **Localized Contextual Analysis Insufficient:** The LLM struggles to generalize even seemingly simple local rules across the entire grid.
*   **Oversimplification of Transformations:** The LLM tends to oversimplify the transformation rules, leading to incorrect outputs.
*   **Complex Rule Interpretation:** The system struggles when the transformation involves multiple intertwined rules.
*   **Incomplete Generalization:** The model fails to accurately generalize rules based on limited examples.
*   **In-place vs. New Object Confusion:** The model is getting confused with modifying the input grid vs. creating a new output grid.
*   **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** In cases where the transformation involves mirroring, the implemented logic is sometimes flawed, leading to incorrect placements of mirrored elements or unintended modifications.
*   **Positional Transformation Neglect:** The system is unable to accurately capture how the grid modifies elements and their positions to produce the result.
*   **Difficulty with complex value dependencies:** The model struggles when the transformation relies on complex combinations or relationships between different values in the grid.
*   **Misinterpretation of spatial relationships:** The model incorrectly interprets how objects and values in the grid are spatially related and how these relationships change during the transformation.
*   **Misinterpretation of Visual Features:** The `analyze_visual_features` step is prone to misinterpreting the key visual features of the grid.
*   **Inconsistent Transformation Application:** The primary failure mode is the inconsistent application of identified transformation rules to the test input.
*   **Ambiguous Transformations:** Some training examples might have multiple possible interpretations, leading the LLM to learn an incorrect or incomplete transformation.
*   **Error in output format**: The model can reason correctly about the grid transformation, but then output a grid of the incorrect size, or even the correct size but as text rather than code.
*   **Dimensionality and Element Distribution:** The approach fails when faced with new input grids that have different dimensions or element distributions compared to the training examples.
*   **Error in Transformation:** The LLM sometimes produces an error rather than a valid transformation.
*   **Overfitting to Superficial Patterns:** The system tends to overfit to simple patterns in the training examples (Iteration 13). For example, instead of understanding the underlying logic behind the transformation, it might simply replicate rows containing specific numbers, leading to incorrect results on the test input (Iteration 13).
*   **Inability to Generalize Complex Rules:** The system struggles with complex transformation rules that involve relationships between different elements or regions of the grid (Iteration 13). The transformation logic often requires spatial reasoning which the LLM fails to capture (Iteration 13).
*   **Output validation inadequate:** Relying on an LLM for output validation may be flawed. A programmatic validation may be needed to ensure that the output is not only in the correct format, but also contains the correct elements.

    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00
    *   **Finding:** The attempt to improve grid transformation problems using the LLM by identifying the overall transformation type, then extracting specific parameters, and finally applying the transformation alone did not solve the underlying inability to generalize from training examples.

    *   **Finding:** The core hypothesis of describing transformations in terms of visual features to improve generalization is only partially supported.
*   **Iteration 8:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Analogical reasoning can be used to identify and apply grid transformations.
    *   **Approach:** Decompose the problem and use the LLM to identify similarities between training examples and test inputs, then apply identified transformations.

    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis of using analogical reasoning via multiple LLM calls was not validated.
*   **Iteration 9:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Attempting to directly transform the grid based on LLM's implicit learning from multi-example prompts would work.
    *   **Approach:** Multi-example prompting and direct transformation without explicit rule definition.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** Relying solely on the LLM's ability to directly transform the grid based on multi-example prompts, without explicitly defining transformation rules, is insufficient for this task.
*   **Iteration 10:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Multi-example prompting in a two-step (analyze, then apply) LLM approach will improve performance by guiding pattern recognition.
    *   **Approach:** Use a two-step LLM approach: first analyze the training examples with multi-example prompts, then apply the derived transformation rule to the test input.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.33.
    *   **Finding:** The multi-example prompting improves performance compared to single-example prompting in the two-step LLM approach, but is still insufficient for reliable generalization.
*   **Iteration 11:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Exploiting the current best approach (Iteration 10) will yield significant improvements.
    *   **Approach:** Focus on refining the prompting strategy and validation techniques from Iteration 10.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.33.
    *   **Finding:** Relying solely on exploitation of the current approach did not yield significant improvement. The accuracy remained low, indicating that the core issues with pattern recognition and generalization were not addressed.

    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis was immediately rejected due to the system's inability to access the LLM. Proper API configuration is paramount.
*   **Iteration 13:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Adding more detailed examples and implementing a validation loop will improve the visual feature analysis and transformation application.
    *   **Approach:** The exploitation strategy was used, which focused on analyzing visual features and then applying a transformation using chain-of-thought prompting.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis was rejected. The strategy failed to achieve any accuracy on the dataset.
*   **Iteration 14:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** The LLM can directly generate the output grid by learning a transformation function represented implicitly in the examples.
    *   **Approach:** Direct generation of output grid using LLM's pattern recognition capabilities.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis was rejected. The LLM's few-shot learning abilities are insufficient for this task, at least with the current prompting strategy. The LLM demonstrates some pattern recognition capabilities, but it cannot generalize to unseen grid configurations. Relies on memorization.

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

*   **Prioritize LLM Access and Error Handling:**
    *   **Verify LLM Access:** Before any further experimentation, the immediate priority is to resolve the LLM access issue. This involves:
        *   Double-checking the API key and ensuring it is correctly set in the environment (the environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
        *   Verifying that the 'gemini-pro' model is available and accessible through the API.
        *   Checking for any network connectivity issues that might be preventing the script from reaching the LLM.
    *   **Basic LLM Call Test:** Implement a very simple test case (e.g., a basic text generation prompt) to confirm that the LLM can be successfully called before attempting more complex tasks.
    *   **Error Handling:** Improve the error handling within the `call_llm` function to provide more informative error messages in case of API failures. This should include logging the specific error codes or messages returned by the LLM API.
*   **Feature Extraction and Rule Encoding:** Explore methods to extract salient features from the grids (e.g., identifying key regions, patterns, or relationships between elements) and encode these features into a format that the LLM can more readily understand. The features can be translated into explicit rules for the LLM to follow.
*   **Implement a More Robust Rule Extraction Mechanism:** Develop a mechanism that can identify and formalize the transformation rules in a more abstract and general way. This could involve using a combination of symbolic reasoning and visual feature analysis.
*   **Focus on Spatial Relationships:** Emphasize the importance of spatial relationships between grid elements in the prompting strategy. Prompting the LLM to describe the transformation in terms of rows, columns, diagonals, or regions and how these relate to each other might improve performance.
*   **Explore Different Model Architectures:** Evaluate the performance of other model architectures, such as those specifically designed for spatial reasoning or graph neural networks, which might be better suited for this task.
*   **Incorporate a More Fine-Grained Validation Process:** Implement a validation process that checks the individual steps of the transformation, rather than just the final result. This could help identify and correct errors earlier in the process.
*   **Enhanced Example Descriptions:** Provide more structured information to the LLM, emphasizing key elements like grid dimensions and relationships between input and output. This could involve adding specific prompts highlighting changes in grid size, element positions, or value transformations.
*   **Transformation Validation:** Implement a more robust validation step for the transformation descriptions generated by the LLM. This could involve testing the described transformation on the training examples to ensure consistency.
*   **Reinforce Spatial Reasoning:** Modify the prompts to explicitly encourage spatial reasoning. For instance, explicitly ask the LLM to identify how elements shift or change position between the input and output grids.
*   **Refine Output Formatting:** Implement stricter output format validation to ensure the LLM generates the grid in the exact required structure. Enforce specific dimensions, data types, and delimiters. Provide explicit formatting examples in the prompt.
*   **Enhanced Feature Analysis:** Prompt the LLM to explicitly identify the *type* of transformation (e.g., "maximum value in a subgrid," "rotation," "reflection," "number replacement based on neighbor values") before attempting to describe it in detail.
*   **Targeted Examples:** Carefully select training examples that represent a wider variety of transformations and edge cases to improve pattern generalization.
*   **Code Generation Fine-Tuning:** Encourage the LLM to generate a *validated* code implementation of the transformation rules. Add instructions to test the code by running the training examples, and fix it if the output is incorrect.
*   **Explicit Spatial Reasoning:** If spatial relationships are involved, provide the LLM with explicit spatial reasoning tools, such as functions to calculate distances, identify neighbors, or perform rotations/reflections on grid elements.
*   **Improved Output Validation:** Implement a more robust validation function that can evaluate the *logic* of the transformation in the output grid, rather than just its format. This might involve comparing the output grid to intermediate steps in the transformation or checking for consistency with the training examples.
*   **Introduce Explicit Rule Extraction:** Focus on methods that first extract explicit transformation rules from the training examples and then apply those rules to the test input. One can use the LLM to extract candidate rules, then validate these rules against the provided examples.
*   **Decompose the Transformation Process:** Decompose the transformation process into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, identifying specific regions or elements to transform, determining the transformation operation, and applying the operation.
*   **Increase Training Data Diversity:** Supplement the training data with more diverse examples that cover different grid dimensions, element distributions, and transformation patterns. Consider using data augmentation techniques to generate synthetic training examples.
*   **Explore Hybrid Approaches:** Investigate hybrid approaches that combine the LLM's reasoning abilities with more traditional algorithms for pattern recognition and grid manipulation. The LLM could be used to guide the algorithm or to validate the results.

*   **Refine Transformation Descriptions:** Develop a more structured and precise language for describing grid transformations. This language should explicitly capture relationships between grid elements, spatial arrangements, and transformation rules.
*   **Focus on Size and Dimensionality Reasoning:** Explicitly incorporate size and dimensionality reasoning into the transformation logic. Develop strategies for handling cases where the input and output grids have different dimensions.
*   **Introduce Verification Mechanisms:** Implement more robust verification mechanisms to validate the transformation description before applying it to the test input. This may involve using the LLM to generate intermediate grids or to explain the reasoning behind the transformation.
*   **Fine-tune LLM Prompts:** Carefully refine the prompts used for `call_llm` to provide more context and guidance to the LLM. This may involve providing more detailed examples, clarifying the expected output format, and explicitly stating the constraints of the task.
*   **Implement a Dimension Inference Module:** Develop a module that explicitly infers the dimensions of the output grid based on the training examples before attempting value transformations. This could involve analyzing the relative sizes of input and output grids in the training set.
*   **Train for positional reasoning**: It's not enough to know what values to change. The system must reason about *where* to change them. It should be trained with examples that emphasize this.
*   **Rethink the LLM Agent Roles:** Re-evaluate the roles of the LLM agents. Instead of specialized row/column analysis, focus on an agent that can analyze the entire grid and propose transformations considering both value changes and dimension adjustments.
*   **Incorporate Validation Steps:** Add validation steps to ensure the generated output grid adheres to patterns observed in the training examples, such as value distributions and dimension ratios.
*   **Consider a Hybrid Approach:** Explore a hybrid approach that combines LLM-based reasoning with traditional image processing techniques for feature extraction and pattern recognition, potentially improving the accuracy of transformation rule inference.
*   **Focus on Rule Decomposition:** Explicitly decompose the transformation rule into smaller, more manageable sub-rules. For example, if the rule involves expansion and substitution, treat these as separate steps.
*   **Implement a More Structured Validation Process:** Develop a more rigorous validation process that checks for specific aspects of the transformation, such as element counts and row/column patterns.
*   **Explore Explicit Coordinate-Based Rules:** Shift the representation of rules to be more explicit about coordinates.
*   **Generate More Diverse Training Data:** Consider augmenting the training dataset with examples that cover a wider range of transformation types and complexities. Focus on generating examples that test specific aspects of the transformation logic.
*   **Add unit tests:** Add unit tests for `transform_grid` function.
*   **Improve Pattern Recognition:** Implement a mechanism to explicitly identify and represent recurring patterns in the training examples. Experiment with different LLM prompting strategies to encourage more accurate pattern identification.
*   **Enhance Shape and Dimensionality Control:** Implement checks to ensure that the generated output grid has the correct shape and dimensions. Consider using a more structured output format to make it easier to enforce these constraints.
*   **Refine Local Context Analysis:** Increase the size of the "local context" window to capture dependencies on more distant cells. Add a mechanism to identify and prioritize the most relevant contextual factors for each cell.
*   **Explore Hybrid Approaches:** Combine the LLM-based approach with more traditional algorithms for pattern recognition and grid manipulation.
*   **Enhance Rule Extraction with Visual and Spatial Reasoning:** Given the visual nature of the grid transformations, explore approaches that explicitly incorporate visual and spatial reasoning capabilities. Incorporating computer vision techniques to analyze the grids and identify relevant patterns. Designing prompts that explicitly encourage the LLM to think about spatial relationships between elements in the grid.
*   **Improve Rule Validation with Counterexamples:** Strengthen the rule validation process by generating counterexamples.
*   **Iterative Refinement of Rules:** Implement an iterative refinement process where the system generates an initial rule, applies it to a subset of the training examples, and then analyzes the results to identify areas where the rule fails.
*   **Break Down the Problem into Simpler Sub-Problems:** Instead of attempting to extract the entire transformation rule at once, break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
*   **Explore Alternative Model Architectures:** Experiment with model architectures that are better suited for visual reasoning tasks.
*   **Improve Pattern Extraction:** Refine the prompt to encourage more accurate pattern extraction. Experiment with different prompt structures. Include more explicit guidance on identifying relationships between input and output grids.
*   **Focus on Dimensionality:** Add constraints to the prompt to ensure the generated output grid has the correct dimensions. Provide examples of how input grid dimensions relate to output grid dimensions in the training data.
*   **Explicit Rule Extraction:** Explore a hybrid approach that combines pattern matching with explicit rule extraction. Have the LLM first attempt to identify explicit rules (e.g., "If a cell in the input grid is X, the corresponding cell in the output grid is Y") before generating candidate output grids.
*   **Few-Shot Learning with Augmented Examples:** Increase the number of training examples to provide more context for the LLM. Generate synthetic examples covering a wider range of transformations.
*   **Output Formatting Constraint:** Explicitly instruct the LLM to output ONLY the grid as a nested list of lists, without any surrounding text, code blocks, or explanations.
*   **Transformation Rule Validation:** Crucially, the LLM needs to *explicitly state* the transformation rule in a human-readable way.
*   **Output Grid Verification:** Check that the output grid has the expected dimensions and that the values are within the valid range.
*   **Intermediate Representations:** A clear, natural language description of the inferred transformation is critical.
*   **Template-Based Generation:** Use templates to guide the LLM in generating the output grid.
*   **Strengthen Transformation Application:** Focus on improving the mechanism for applying learned transformations to the test input.
*   **Improve Training Data Utilization:** Enhance the use of training data by giving the LLM more explicit guidance or structure about the pattern it needs to extract.
*   **Implement Output Validation:** Add a validation step to ensure the generated output grid conforms to the expected format and dimensions.
*   **Refine Analogical Reasoning:** Improve the analogical reasoning process by providing more context or constraints to guide the LLM in identifying relevant similarities.
*   **Adapt `analyze_elements`:** Adapt the `analyze_elements` function to consider the *position and neighborhood* of each element.
*   **Handle Complex Transformations:** The system needs to be able to handle *complex transformations* rules beyond single element changes.
*    **Decomposition with Explicit Rules:** Explicitly tell the LLM what rule to follow to transform the input grid into the output grid.
*   **Programmatic Output Validation:** The validation must ensure not only format, but correctness. The validation step should include programmatic checks based on the identified transformation rule to ensure that the output grid is consistent with the learned pattern.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #1:
Iteration: 7
Accuracy: 0.33
Approach Summary: The script solves grid transformation problems by analyzing visual features and applying transformations described in terms of these features. It uses a chain-of-thought approach where the problem is decomposed into analyzing visual features and applying a transformation. The agent roles involved are an expert at analyzing visual features and an expert at applying transformations. The function `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process, calling `analyze_visual_features` to get a transformation description, verifying it, and then using `apply_transformation` to generate the output. `call_llm` interfaces with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves analyzing the grid, describing the transformation, verifying the description, and finally applying the transformation to generate the output grid.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #2:
Iteration: 10
Accuracy: 0.33
Approach Summary: The script solves grid transformation problems using a two-step LLM approach: first, `analyze_visual_features` analyzes the problem and generates a transformation description, which is then validated to ensure it's usable, and second, `apply_transformation` applies the described transformation to produce the output grid. The script uses chain-of-thought prompting with multi-example prompts to guide the LLM. Two agents are implicitly defined via system instructions: a visual feature analyzer and a transformation applier. The functions `solve_grid_transformation`, `analyze_visual_features`, `apply_transformation`, and `call_llm` are used sequentially to breakdown the grid problem, use an LLM to solve the problem, and return the solution. The overall workflow involves analyzing visual features, validating the analysis, applying the transformation based on the analysis, and returning the final transformed grid.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #3:
Iteration: 11
Accuracy: 0.33
Approach Summary: The script solves grid transformation problems by first analyzing visual features using an LLM, then applying the derived transformation. The problem is decomposed into `analyze_visual_features` and `apply_transformation`. There are two LLM agent roles: one for feature analysis and another for applying transformations.

*   `solve_grid_transformation`: Orchestrates the solution by calling `analyze_visual_features` and `apply_transformation`.
*   `analyze_visual_features`: Analyzes the problem and returns a transformation description. It uses `call_llm` to get the transformation description and a validation of the description.
*   `apply_transformation`: Applies the transformation from `analyze_visual_features` to the test grid using `call_llm`.
*   `call_llm`: Makes calls to the Gemini LLM, handling both prompts and system instructions.

The overall workflow involves analyzing the visual features of the input using an LLM, validating the LLM response, and then applying the described transformation to generate the output grid, again using an LLM.

            PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED VARIATIONS:
            

            EXPLOITATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the error patterns, targeted improvements, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. CRITICAL: Break down the problem into distinct reasoning steps before modifying code
            3. CRITICAL: Analyze the best scripts to identify which components are working well and which are failing. Focus your improvements on the weak points while preserving successful components.
            4. Maintain the core successful elements of the best approaches
            5. Consider how you can combine strengths from multiple top-performing approaches
            6. CRITICAL: Add EMBEDDED EXAMPLES to EVERY LLM prompt that illustrate:
               - Sample input that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            7. Focus on fixing specific issues identified in previous error analyses. Create an explicit HYPOTHESIS for each targeted improvement, as well as a way to verify if it's successful.
            8. Enhance chain-of-thought reasoning and verification steps. Verification steps should be added to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            9. Apply the key insights from ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS to enhance the approach
            10. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment

            IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
            Analyze why the top approaches succeeded where others failed. Identify the key differentiators and strengthen them further.

            SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT APPROACH:
            1. First, identify which specific function or component is underperforming based on error analysis
            2. Examine how error cases differ from successful cases
            3. For each identified weakness, implement a targeted enhancement
            4. Add additional verification steps around modified components
            5. Consider how components interact - ensure improvements don't break successful parts

            Consider enhancing the script with one or more of these patterns:
            - Repeated validation with feedback loops
            - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
            - Dynamic input-dependent routing
            - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
            - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
            - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
            - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLOITATION phase:
            - Build upon what's working well in the best approaches
            - Consider creative combinations of successful techniques from different scripts
            - Make TARGETED improvements to address specific error patterns
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply the knowledge from our accumulated learnings
            - Significantly enhance the script to address weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your improvements
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

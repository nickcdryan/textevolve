            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

    "question": "PASSAGE: The war took a heavy toll, especially in the northern British colonies. The losses of Massachusetts men alone in 1745-46 have been estimated as 8% of that colony's adult male population. According to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Louisbourg was returned to France three years later, in exchange for the city of Madras in India, captured by the French from the British. This decision outraged New Englanders, particularly Massachusetts colonists who had contributed the most to the expedition  The British government eventually acknowledged Massachusetts' effort with a payment of \u00a3180,000 after the war, which the province used to retire its devalued paper currency. The peace treaty, which restored all colonial borders to their pre-war status, did little to end the lingering enmity between France, Britain, and their respective colonies, nor did it resolve any territorial disputes. Tensions remained in both North America and Europe, and were reignited with the 1754 outbreak of the French and Indian War in North America, which spread to Europe two years later as the Seven Years' War. Between 1749 and 1755 in Acadia and Nova Scotia, the fighting continued in Father Le Loutre's War.\n\nQUESTION: In which year did the Seven Years' War start in Europe?",

    "question": "PASSAGE: The Chiefs took an early lead on a 30-yard pass from Tyler Thigpen to Mark Bradley.  The Chiefs defense continued to show improvement in the red zone, limiting the Chargers to two field goals instead of two touch downs.  At the end of the first half, Thigpen threw a pass to 34&#160;yard touchdown pass to Tony Gonzalez. However, the extra point snap was botched and an attempt at a quick pass failed. The Chargers controlled the second half better than the first, scoring two touchdowns and leading the Chiefs by 7 at the end of the fourth quarter.  The Chiefs' final drive ended with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Gonzalez. A 1-point PAT would tie the game. However, Herm Edwards told Thigpen to go for two, explaining in a post-game interview that the defense was too beat up for overtime play.  The resulting two-point conversion ended in an incomplete pass.  The Chiefs lost by one point.\n\nQUESTION: How many yards were there in difference between the longest and shortest touchdown pass?",

  {
    "iteration": 0,
    "issue": "The system fails when it needs to identify the \"second longest\" touchdown pass.

  {
    "iteration": 3,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's lack of a reliable mechanism for recognizing when a calculation (specifically aggregation or percentage calculation) is required and then executing that calculation to produce the final answer. Additionally the system often provides \"Correct\" as answers even when more specific information is expected."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 4,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's inability to track and calculate the final scores of teams based on individual scoring plays described in the passage. This stems from a limitation in complex arithmetic reasoning and score aggregation."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 5,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's inability to correctly perform temporal reasoning, specifically calculating the time difference between events mentioned in the passage.

  },
  {
    "iteration": 6,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the **absence of a functional arithmetic reasoning component** that can identify and execute basic calculations based on extracted numerical information. This prevents the system from answering questions that go beyond simple information retrieval."

  {
    "iteration": 7,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's **inadequate question understanding and answer type classification**. The system fails to determine the expected answer format (numerical, textual, boolean) and falls back to providing generic confirmations (\"Correct\" or \"True\") or verifications."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 8,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's unreliable ability to extract *all* relevant information from the passage to perform correct calculations and to discern the required level of precision for numerical answers. This manifests as incorrect calculations, failure to identify key elements, and overly broad range-based answers when a specific number is needed."

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Develop a more robust reasoning engine that can chain together multiple inferences and calculations based on extracted information.",
  "Implement a system that breaks down complex extraction tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, ensuring that *all* relevant information is considered.",
  "Return the calculated result.",
  "Add logic to specifically handle numerical ranges, identify the individual numbers and relationships between them.",
  "Analyze the question for keywords indicating arithmetic operations (e.g., \"total,\" \"more than,\" \"difference\").",
  "Implement a constraint satisfaction mechanism to ensure that the generated answers satisfy all constraints mentioned in the passage.",
  "Implement more sophisticated techniques for identifying entities, relationships, and attributes within the passage. This may involve using semantic parsing or relation extraction models.",
  "Perform the appropriate calculation based on the question and extracted values.",
  "Fine-tune the system to provide precise answers whenever possible and to only provide ranges when the question explicitly asks for them or when uncertainty exists. Add a rule to consider the end-points of ranges as options.",
  "Add a module that analyzes the question to determine the expected output format (e.g., a specific number, a range, a named entity)."

    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return solution_result["solution"]

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 9 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 1.00) ===
Approach: The script uses a multi-stage LLM approach, including chain-of-thought reasoning by decomposing the problem into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. It uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model with specific system instructions and prompts at each stage, effectively assigning different "expert" roles to the LLM. The workflow involves `analyze_question` to determine the question type and keywords, `extract_relevant_passage` to find relevant text, `generate_answer` to create an initial answer, and `verify_answer` to confirm the answer and perform calculations if needed.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 8 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 0.70) ===
Approach: The script implements a multi-stage question answering system using the Gemini LLM. It decomposes the problem into question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and answer verification. The `analyze_question` function identifies the question type and keywords, then `extract_relevant_passage` retrieves relevant information. An initial answer is generated using `generate_answer` which is then validated by the `verify_answer` function. The overall workflow starts with `main`, which orchestrates calls to `analyze_question`, `extract_relevant_passage`, `generate_answer`, and `verify_answer`, with `call_llm` serving as a centralized method for LLM interactions.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 5 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 0.80) ===
Approach: This script uses a multi-stage LLM approach with techniques like question analysis, relevant passage extraction, answer generation, and verification. The problem is decomposed into analyzing the question, extracting the relevant passage, generating an initial answer, and then verifying that answer for correctness. The agent roles are implied by the function names, such as a question analyzer, passage extractor, answer generator, and answer verifier. Other functions used are `call_llm` which is used by the agent roles to call the LLM with specific prompts and system instructions.

The overall workflow begins with `main` calling `analyze_question` to determine the question type and keywords, then `extract_relevant_passage` uses this analysis to extract the most relevant information, then `generate_answer` uses the extracted passage and question analysis to generate an answer, and finally, `verify_answer` verifies the generated answer against the passage.

# DATASET-SPECIFIC LEARNINGS & EXPERIMENT LOG

This document serves as a running log of our learnings, experiments, and findings specific to the question-answering task on this particular dataset of sports narratives and demographic data.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Passage Dependency:** Questions are heavily reliant on the provided passage for accurate answers. The questions cannot be answered without the contextual information presented in the passage.
*   **Question Structure:** Questions are consistently formatted as `PASSAGE:\n... \n\nQUESTION: ...`. This structure clearly separates the context from the query.
*   **Passage Content:** Passages consist of narratives describing sports games (primarily American football) or demographic data. They provide the context needed to answer the questions. Passages exhibit variability in content (sports, demographics, geography, nickel production, history) and length. Passages often take the form of narratives describing events, which can be challenging for precise information extraction required for quantitative comparisons. Passages contain extraneous information, necessitating accurate identification and extraction of only the relevant details.
*   **Mixed Answer Types:** The dataset contains questions that require different answer formats, including numerical values (e.g., "How many yards?"), proper nouns (e.g., "Which quarterback?"), and locations (e.g., "Where was the first expidition?").
*   **Sports and Historical Context:** The dataset appears to contain a significant portion of questions related to sports (American Football specifically) and historical events, requiring knowledge of team names, player names, and historical locations/events.
*   **Answer Types:** Answers are typically concise and factual, directly extracted or derived from the passage. Common answer types include proper nouns (player names), numerical values (counts, yardage, rates), and dates.
*   **Question Types:**
    *   **Fact Extraction:** Directly retrieving information from the passage (e.g., "Who caught the final touchdown of the game?", "How many receiving yards...").
    *   **Counting:** Determining the number of occurrences of an event or entity (e.g., "How many running backs ran for a touchdown?"). Requires correlation and aggregation across the passage (e.g., "How many touchdown runs were made for the same yardage?").
    *   **Calculation:** Performing arithmetic operations on values extracted from the passage (e.g., "How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?"). Requires unit awareness.
    *   **Comparison/Difference:** Comparing values or entities described in the passage (e.g., "How many more TFR did Malays have in 2004 compared to Ethnic Chinese TFR in 2004?", "How many yards longer..."). Requires numerical reasoning or extraction of specific numbers from the passage (e.g., "How many field goals?", "How many in percent..."). Often requires extracting multiple numerical values and performing comparisons.
    *   **Ordinality:** Questions may include ordinal terms like "second longest", requiring ranking and comparison.
    *   **Multiple Instances:** Question has multiple valid answers in the passage (e.g., "List all the countries...").
    *   **Score Tracking:** Questions that require tracking and aggregating scores based on individual plays or events described in the passage. These questions do not explicitly state "what was the final score" but require addition/subtraction of point values.
    *   **Implicit Numerical Reasoning:** Questions require *implicit* numerical reasoning or inference. For example, extracting individual point values, and combining them to determine a final score.
    *   **Temporal Reasoning:** Questions often involve temporal aspects, requiring understanding the sequence of events (e.g., "final touchdown," "first field goal"). The passages often present information in chronological order. This can also involve calculating the duration between two events, which necessitates identifying start and end dates and performing subtraction (e.g., calculating the number of years between Colorado becoming a state (August 1, 1876) and the creation of its last county (2001)).
    *   **Complex Date/Event Identification:** Correctly pinpointing the exact start and end dates of events can be challenging due to varied phrasing and implied timelines within the passages. The passages contain many dates and events, requiring careful extraction.
    *   **Holistic Understanding for Final Score Calculation:** Some questions require a holistic understanding of the passage in order to determine the final score by analyzing the scoring events described in the passage.
    *   **Numerical Reasoning and Aggregation:** Many questions require aggregating numerical information presented in the passage. This includes addition, subtraction, and potentially weighted averages or other calculations (e.g., "How many total casualties were there?").
    *   **Percentage Interpretation:** A significant subset of questions involves understanding and manipulating percentages. Some questions directly ask for percentages, while others require calculating differences or identifying populations based on percentage ranges (e.g., "How many in percent weren't 45 to 64?").
    *   **Implicit Information Retrieval:** Some questions require synthesizing information from multiple parts of the passage or performing logical inference based on the extracted information. The model isn't explicitly told how to combine the data.

*   **Implicit Information:** The answer might need to be inferred based on multiple pieces of information, requiring the model to synthesize information from different parts of the passage.
*   **Precision Requirements:** Questions often require precise numerical answers. Providing a range when a precise answer is expected leads to incorrect answers.
*   **Extraneous Information:** Passages often contain rich contextual details that are irrelevant to the question, requiring the model to filter out noise.
*   **Synonyms and Paraphrasing:** The question might use different wording than the passage to refer to the same entity or event.
*   **Multiple Occurrences:** An event (e.g., a touchdown) might occur multiple times; the question could be specific about which occurrence to consider (e.g., "first," "last," "second longest").
*   **Negation:** Questions like "Who did *not* score a touchdown?" require careful handling of negated conditions.
*   **Units:** Need to be aware of units when performing calculations (yards, points, etc.)
*   **Numerical Reasoning Requirement:** A significant portion of questions requires numerical reasoning, including summation, percentage calculations, or other basic arithmetic operations, even when the information is explicitly available in the provided passage. The questions often involve quantities, counts, or proportions extracted from the passage text.
*   **Ambiguity in Expected Answer Granularity:** The "correctness" of an answer can be subjective, particularly when the system provides the correct components of the answer without performing the required calculation. The golden answer might expect a single aggregated number, while the system provides the disaggregated components, leading to a mismatch even though the system extracted the right information. For example, providing "12 Dutch and 10 English" when the answer is expected to be "22".
*   **Census and Demographics Questions:** The presence of census-related questions which frequently require percentage or difference calculations based on population data.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Multi-Stage Approach:** A multi-stage approach, involving question analysis, passage retrieval/extraction, answer generation, and verification, shows promise in decomposing the problem. This allows for breaking down the complex task into smaller, manageable components.
    *   Breaking down the problem into question type identification, focused passage extraction, answer generation, and verification helps. This is particularly helpful where numerical or multi-step reasoning is required. Accuracy was 1.00 using this approach in Iteration 1, 2, and 9. The multi-stage LLM approach appears to be effective for initial extraction and analysis. The 90% accuracy in Iteration 4 suggests that analyzing questions, extracting relevant passages, and generating simple answers are generally successful. However, its effectiveness is currently limited by the lack of arithmetic reasoning. The modularity allows for focused improvement of specific stages. The 70% accuracy in Iteration 8 indicates the core multi-stage approach is fundamentally sound *for a subset of questions*. However, the complexity of this approach could be a potential failure mode. Over-decomposition might introduce unnecessary steps and potential errors in each stage, even if ultimately successful.
    *   Using separate LLM calls for each subtask (analyze, extract, generate, verify) isolates errors and allows for targeted improvements. This was implemented and effective in Iteration 2.
    *   Decomposing the problem into smaller steps, each handled by a dedicated function (agent), likely contributes to the initial success by isolating concerns and simplifying individual tasks.

*   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting (LLM-focused):** Encouraging the LLM to explicitly show its reasoning steps (e.g., using "Let's think step by step:") can improve accuracy and allow for debugging. Example:

    ```
    PASSAGE: ...

    QUESTION: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?

    Let's think step by step:
    First, I need to identify Chris Johnson's first touchdown yardage. The passage says "Chris Johnson got a 6-yard TD run".
    Second, I need to identify Jason Hanson's first field goal yardage. The passage says "Jason Hanson getting a 53-yard field goal."
    Finally, I need to add those two numbers. 6 + 53 = 59.
    ANSWER: 59
    ```
    *   Hypothesis: Chain-of-thought prompting enhances the LLM's ability to reason and extract information from the passages. (Confirmed for at least a subset of questions in Iteration 1).

*   **Example-Driven Reasoning (LLM-focused):** Providing the LLM with a few examples of questions and answers to guide its reasoning is effective. Suggests that the LLM benefits from having examples of how to handle different question types. This was shown to be effective in Iteration 2.

*   **Few-Shot Learning (LLM-focused):** Providing the LLM with a few examples of questions and answers to guide its reasoning.

*   **Answer Validation Prompt (LLM-focused):** Using a separate prompt to validate the generated answer. This prompt could ask the LLM to justify its answer based on the passage. This strategy is important for questions that require calculations (Iteration 9).

*   **Constrained Decoding (LLM-focused):** If the answer is known to be a number, use constrained decoding to ensure that the LLM only generates numerical answers.

*   **Explicit Scoring Rule Definition:** Explicitly define the scoring rules for each type of play in prompt engineering to provide context for the LLM to calculate final scores. (Next Step from Iteration 4).

*   **Leveraging Expert Roles:** When guided with specific system instructions ("expert roles"), the LLM can effectively perform question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and verification.

*   **Ineffective Strategies:** The "exploitation" strategy (Iteration 5), while generally aiming to leverage previously successful patterns, does not adequately address the specific challenges of temporal reasoning and arithmetic calculation present in this dataset.

*   *No strategies identified as specifically working well given the low accuracy in ITERATION 7.* The current multi-stage LLM approach, while conceptually sound, isn't effectively translating to accurate answers for this dataset. More work is needed to address the failures.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Incorrect Answer Type Handling:** The system frequently fails to identify the correct answer type. For example, instead of providing a numerical answer to a "How many..." question, it returns a verification status ("Correct"). This suggests a weakness in the `analyze_question` function's ability to determine the expected answer format. Observed in ITERATION 7. If the `analyze_question` step misidentifies the question type, the subsequent steps are likely to fail (Iteration 9).
*   **Over-reliance on Verification:** The system seems to prematurely stop at verification, without extracting the specific answer from the extracted passage. This leads to responses like "True" or "Correct" when a more detailed answer is required. Observed in ITERATION 7 and Iteration 3. Example: When asked "Which areas did Louis IX give to Henry III?", the system answers "The answer is correct." instead of the expected answer which is: "Limoges, Cahors, and Périgueux". This renders the information useless.
*   **Passage Understanding Deficiencies:** While the passages contain the answer, the system struggles to extract the correct information, even when it correctly identifies the relevant passage. Observed in ITERATION 7.
*   **Incomplete Numerical Extraction:** The system struggles to extract *all* relevant numbers required for calculations. In the "total casualties" question, the system provided a range instead of calculating the total, indicating it likely didn't process all numerical values present in the passage.
*   **Difficulty in Combining Numerical Data:** The "How many touchdown runs were made for the same yardage?" question reveals a failure in identifying and counting instances based on a specific criterion (yardage). This requires the model to correlate and aggregate information across the passage, which it struggled with.
*   **Missing Implicit Information:** Some errors occur when the model fails to recognize and use implicit information, such as understanding implied relationships between the entities in a passage. This also surfaces in the example where the model claims missing percentages.

*   **Missing Arithmetic Reasoning:** The system fails when questions require numerical computation. For example, in the question about the Ravens and Steelers score, the system couldn't deduce the final scores from the game events and calculate the difference, leading to the response "There is not enough information."
*   **Incorrect Date Identification:** The system struggles to consistently identify the correct start and end dates for calculating time differences. For example, the system failed to extract the correct start date of "the time Colorada was declared a state" (August 1, 1876) and the end date of when "it's last county was created" (2001).
*   **Inaccurate Handling of Ordinality:** Inability to correctly answer questions involving ordinality (e.g., "second longest"). The system often fails to systematically identify all instances of the relevant event, extract the relevant attribute, order them, and then select the item at the specified ordinal position. Instead, it appears to make direct, often incorrect, guesses based on incomplete context.
*   **Precision Mismatch:** Providing a range when a precise answer is expected is a frequent failure mode. This indicates a weakness in the verification stage's ability to refine answers to the appropriate level of granularity.

*   **Failure to Extract All Relevant Instances:** The system sometimes fails to identify all instances of events related to the question, leading to incomplete information for comparisons and ordinal ranking.

*   **Inability to Filter Extraneous Information:** Difficulty in filtering out irrelevant details from the passage, leading to confusion and incorrect answers.

*   **Arithmetic Errors:** Mistakes in performing calculations. Now a significant and recurring problem. As an example, even when correct dates were identified, the subtraction of 1876 from 2001 was not performed accurately.

*   **Missing Numerical Aggregation:** The system fails when questions require combining multiple numbers from the passage into a single answer (e.g., summing counts of different items). It extracts the individual numbers but doesn't perform the necessary calculation. *Example:* The question "How many Dutch and English warships were blocking Spanish support?" expects the sum of 12 Dutch and 10 English warships (22), but the system returns "12 Dutch and 10 English". Observed in Iteration 3.

*   **Lack of Calculation Awareness and Execution:** The system is not reliably detecting the need for any calculation. *Example:* The question "How many in percent from the census weren't African American?" requires subtracting the percentage of African Americans from 100%, but the system fails to perform this operation and gives 2.8% instead of 97.2%. Observed in Iteration 3.

*   **Ambiguity Resolution:** Difficulty in disambiguating similar information or names within the passage.

*   **Incomplete Information Inference:** Failing to correctly infer the answer when it requires synthesizing information from multiple parts of the passage.

*   **Arithmetic Reasoning and Aggregation:** The primary failure mode, as highlighted in Iteration 4, is the inability to perform complex arithmetic reasoning to aggregate scores based on the narrative descriptions in the passage. The system fails when it needs to keep track of running totals and calculate the final difference between scores.

*   **Implicit Numerical Reasoning:** The system struggles when the question requires *implicit* numerical reasoning or inference. For example, it can extract individual point values, but not combine them to determine a final score.

*   **Misinterpreting Data:** The system misinterpreted the question "How many total points were scored in the game?" and therefore did not successfully parse the result in the passage to extract the correct result.

*   **Potential Failure Modes (Anticipated based on dataset characteristics):**
    *   *Numerical Reasoning Errors:* Questions involving more complex arithmetic (e.g., multiple steps, percentages) could lead to incorrect answers. This has now been confirmed to be a significant issue.
    *   *Ambiguous or Vague Questions:* Questions that are not clearly worded or require significant inference could be misinterpreted by the question analysis module.
    *   *Passage Extraction Errors:* If the relevant passage is not correctly identified, the subsequent answer generation will be flawed.  This could happen if keywords are ambiguous or if the passage requires deeper understanding.
    *   *Verification Errors:* The verification step could fail to detect subtle inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the generated answer. The current implementation is insufficient to correct errors in numerical calculation and to ensure the desired precision in the final answer. Reliance on exact string matching for answer verification (if used) could be a source of failure if the wording in the generated answer doesn't perfectly match the passage (Iteration 9).
    *   *Over-Decomposition:* The complexity of the multi-stage approach could be a potential failure mode. Over-decomposition might introduce unnecessary steps and potential errors in each stage, even if ultimately successful (Iteration 9).

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **2025-05-19 14:27:04 - INITIAL DATASET ANALYSIS:** Comprehensive analysis of dataset characteristics, challenges, potential approaches, and implementation recommendations. (See full analysis in original entry). Key findings included:
    *   The importance of understanding the question type (extraction, counting, calculation, comparison).
    *   The need for temporal reasoning and arithmetic reasoning.
    *   Potential solution strategies: information retrieval & extraction, direct answer generation.
    *   Decomposition steps: question understanding, relevant passage identification, information extraction/calculation, answer formatting.
    *   Validation techniques: self-consistency checks, units checks, reasonableness checks.

*   **ITERATION 0:** Initial multi-stage approach achieved 67% accuracy. Highlighted the need for improved handling of questions involving comparisons and ordinality. The system needs mechanisms for systematically extracting and processing multiple instances of events from the passage.

*   **ITERATION 1:** Achieved 1.0 accuracy using a multi-stage LLM approach with chain-of-thought prompting.
    *   The approach proved highly effective for the tested subset of the dataset.

*   **ITERATION 2:** Achieved 1.0 accuracy using a multi-stage LLM approach with example-driven reasoning.
    *   The modular approach (analyzing question, extracting passage, generating answer, verifying) seems to be effective.
    *   Using separate LLM calls for each subtask (analyze, extract, generate, verify) likely isolates errors and allows for targeted improvements.

*   **ITERATION 3:** The multi-stage LLM approach, in its current implementation, struggles with questions that necessitate any form of numerical calculation or aggregation, even when the component numbers are correctly extracted from the passage.
    *   The hypothesis that LLMs can inherently perform complex reasoning from raw text is rejected, at least without explicit instruction and verification steps targeted at numerical operations.
    *   The system also exhibited a tendency to answer "The answer is correct" instead of providing the actual answer.

*   **ITERATION 4:** The initial hypothesis that a multi-stage LLM approach can effectively answer questions based on text passages is partially confirmed. The system achieves high accuracy on simpler questions but fails when arithmetic reasoning is involved (90% accuracy on simpler questions).
    *   The hypothesis that the current multi-stage approach is sufficient for all types of questions is rejected, as demonstrated by the failure to handle questions requiring score tracking and comparison.

*   **ITERATION 5:** The "exploitation" strategy, while generally aiming to leverage previously successful patterns, does not adequately address the specific challenges of temporal reasoning and arithmetic calculation present in this dataset. The 80% accuracy indicates a ceiling is being reached with the current approach.

*   **ITERATION 6:** The multi-stage LLM approach shows promise in decomposing the problem but needs to be augmented with a dedicated arithmetic reasoning component to solve quantitative questions. It is effective for simple information retrieval but insufficient for questions requiring calculations based on the extracted information. Errors occur primarily in the "generate" and "verify" stages due to the lack of arithmetic capability.

*   **ITERATION 7:** The initial hypothesis that a multi-stage LLM approach with question analysis and answer verification would be sufficient for this dataset is rejected. The 40% accuracy indicates that the current implementation needs significant improvements. The system struggles with correct answer type identification, and prematurely stops at verification, without extracting the specific answer from the extracted passage. Passage understanding also remains deficient. The question analysis stage is likely a bottleneck.

*   **ITERATION 8:** The multi-stage approach shows promise (70% accuracy), but the LLM's inherent limitations in precise numerical reasoning and information extraction are the bottleneck. The successful cases likely involve questions where the relevant passage is easily identifiable and the required calculations are straightforward and explicitly stated in the passage.

*   **ITERATION 9:** Achieved 1.00 accuracy using a multi-stage approach. The system's ability to handle quantitative reasoning, as demonstrated by the sports question (calculating the difference in yards), is crucial for this dataset. `verify_answer` is an important step. The success indicates that the LLM, when guided with specific system instructions ("expert roles"), can effectively perform question analysis, passage extraction, answer generation, and verification.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Investigate Stage Necessity:** Investigate the necessity of all stages in the current implementation. Can any stages be streamlined or eliminated without sacrificing accuracy? For example, explore whether direct answer generation from the passage (bypassing explicit question type analysis) is sufficient for certain question types (Iteration 9).
*   **Challenge Verification:** Introduce more challenging questions that require more complex reasoning or calculations to test the limits of the current approach. This would help to identify potential weaknesses in the `verify_answer` stage (Iteration 9).
*   **Error Detection in Question Analysis:** Implement a mechanism to detect and correct errors in the `analyze_question` stage. This could involve a confidence score or a secondary check to ensure the identified question type is correct (Iteration 9).
*   **LLM Exploration:** Explore the use of different LLMs or fine-tuning the existing LLM to improve the accuracy and efficiency of each stage (Iteration 9).
*   **Prompt Optimization:** Evaluate the impact of different prompts and system instructions on the performance of each stage (Iteration 9).
*   **Strengthen Numerical Reasoning:** Implement a dedicated numerical reasoning module, potentially using a symbolic calculator or a more robust method for numerical extraction. This could be integrated before the 'generate_answer' and after the 'extract_relevant_passage' step.  This module should be able to perform basic arithmetic, compare numbers, and identify numerical relationships.
*   **Improve Information Aggregation:** Enhance the passage extraction and analysis phases to explicitly identify and extract sets of related numerical data points.  This might involve using techniques like dependency parsing to understand the relationships between numbers and entities in the text.
*   **Refine Verification:** The `verify_answer` stage needs a more nuanced approach for numerical answers.  This includes a sub-module to evaluate the *precision* of the generated answer and to flag ranges when specific values are required. Consider a calibration phase to adjust how aggressively this module corrects answers.
*   **Implement a mechanism to resolve implicit relationships:** Before generating an answer, add a step where the model is explicitly prompted to identify and state implicit relationships. This will help to avoid cases where critical information is omitted during answer generation.
*   **Enhance Question Analysis:**
    *   Fine-tune the `analyze_question` function to more accurately classify the expected answer type (numerical, entity, boolean, etc.). Consider using a separate model specifically trained for answer type classification. (From ITERATION 7)
    *   Implement more robust pattern recognition in the `analyze_question` function to identify question keywords (e.g., "How many," "Which," "Where") that strongly suggest the answer type. (From ITERATION 7)

*   **Refine Passage Extraction:**
    *   Experiment with different prompting strategies for the `extract_relevant_passage` function. Provide the LLM with more context about the question type and the desired information. (From ITERATION 7)
    *   Implement a scoring mechanism to rank the relevance of different passage snippets. (From ITERATION 7)

*   **Improve Answer Generation:**
    *   Ensure that the `generate_answer` function explicitly extracts the identified answer (numerical value, entity, etc.) from the relevant passage snippet, rather than simply providing a general confirmation. (From ITERATION 7)
    *   Add specific instructions to the prompt to force the LLM to extract the answer and include it in its response. (From ITERATION 7)

*   **Evaluation and Error Analysis:**
    *   Implement a more detailed error logging and tracking system to better understand the root causes of failures. (From ITERATION 7)
    *   Manually analyze a larger sample of failed examples to identify common patterns and areas for improvement. (From ITERATION 7)

*   **Explore Few-Shot Learning/Fine-tuning:**
    *   Consider fine-tuning a smaller language model specifically for this question-answering task, using a dataset of similar questions and answers. This could improve performance and reduce reliance on prompt engineering. (From ITERATION 7)

*   **Implement an Arithmetic Reasoning Module:** Introduce a module specifically designed for identifying numerical values, understanding the required calculations, and executing those calculations. This module could be integrated into the "generate\_answer" function.
*   **Improve Score Interpretation:** Improve the ability of the models to extract the relevant scoring information and distinguish what each event implies about the numerical score.
*   **Enhance Verification:** Augment the "verify\_answer" function to check not only the factual correctness but also the numerical validity of the answer given the extracted information. This would involve checking if the calculated answer is consistent with the numbers found in the passage.
*   **Implement a Date Normalization Module:** Develop a module that can reliably extract and normalize dates from the passage text into a standard format (YYYY-MM-DD) to ensure consistent date representation.
*   **Arithmetic Solver Module:** Integrate a simple arithmetic solver module that takes two dates as input and calculates the difference in years, months, or days, as required by the question. This will offload the arithmetic calculation from the LLM, reducing the risk of errors.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** Experiment with a hybrid approach that combines LLM-based reasoning with specialized modules for date extraction and arithmetic calculation. The LLM can focus on identifying the relevant events and dates, while the specialized modules handle the actual calculations.
*   **Implement Score Tracking Agent:** Introduce a "Score Tracker" agent specifically designed to track and update scores based on the narrative descriptions in the passage. This agent should be capable of identifying scoring events (touchdowns, field goals, etc.) and updating the scores accordingly. (Next Step from Iteration 4).

*   **Incorporate Numerical Reasoning Module:** Integrate a numerical reasoning module within the "Generate Answer" agent. This module should be capable of performing simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, comparison) on extracted numerical values to answer questions requiring quantitative analysis. (Next Step from Iteration 4).

*   **Refine Passage Extraction:** Enhance the "Extract Relevant Passage" agent to specifically identify and extract sections of the passage that describe scoring events or relevant numerical data. This can improve the accuracy of subsequent reasoning steps. (Next Step from Iteration 4).

*   **Improve Ordinality Handling:**
    *   Modify the `extract_relevant_passage` function to identify *all* instances of events related to the question.
    *   Introduce a new function, `rank_answers`, that orders extracted information based on a specific criteria (e.g., yardage).
    *   Update the `analyze_question` function to specifically identify questions requiring ranking or comparison. If identified, flag the question for processing by the `rank_answers` function.
    *   In `generate_answer`, incorporate a step to select the correct ranked answer based on the ordinality requested in the question (e.g., "second longest").
    *   Add unit tests specifically targeting questions involving ordinality and comparisons to ensure the system can accurately rank and select answers.

*   **Enhance Information Extraction:** Investigate techniques for improving the accuracy and completeness of information extraction, including named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and semantic role labeling.

*   **Implement a Robust Validation Step:** Develop a more sophisticated validation step to catch errors before the final answer is generated. This could involve verifying units, checking for consistency with the passage, and assessing the reasonableness of the answer. Add adversarial examples designed to trick the verification step.

*   **Explore Different LLM Prompting Strategies:** Experiment with different prompting strategies to improve the LLM's reasoning abilities, including chain-of-thought prompting, few-shot learning, and answer validation prompts.

*   **Develop a More Sophisticated Question Analyzer:** Improve the `analyze_question` function to better identify the type of reasoning required to answer the question, including temporal reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and logical reasoning.

*   **Implement Calculation Detection Module:** Introduce a module within the `analyze_question` function to explicitly identify questions requiring calculation. This module should flag the question type (summation, percentage, difference, etc.) and the involved entities. This is CRITICAL based on Iteration 3 results.

*   **Calculation Execution Module:** If the calculation detection module flags a question, activate a "calculation execution" module. This module will perform the identified calculation using the extracted numbers from the `extract_relevant_passage` step. The module should have error handling and verification to catch incorrect calculations. This is CRITICAL based on Iteration 3 results.

*   **Enhance Answer Generation:** Modify the `generate_answer` function to prioritize providing explicit numerical answers when a calculation is detected, instead of relying on potentially ambiguous textual descriptions.

*   **Post-Processing Numeric Answers:** Implement a post-processing step to ensure that numeric answers are formatted correctly and include appropriate units (e.g., "%" sign for percentages).

*   **Explicit Answer Reporting:** Make sure the `generate_answer` provides the answer and not just a verification of the correctness.

*   **Expand Dataset for Stress-Testing:** Expand the dataset with new question types, more complex reasoning problems, passages with ambiguous or contradictory information, and passages containing data requiring external knowledge (dates, names, etc.) to further stress-test the system and identify failure points. Specifically:
    *   Introduce more complex or ambiguous questions that require more advanced reasoning or inference.
    *   Stress-test numerical reasoning with questions requiring multi-step calculations, unit conversions, or proportional reasoning.
    *   Test how well the passage retrieval works when the question has multiple valid answers in the passage (e.g., "List all the countries...").

*   **Evaluate the impact of different LLMs:** Experiment with different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to see if performance can be further improved or if certain LLMs are better suited for specific subtasks.

*   **Analyze the verification module:** Examine how the verification step is implemented and how robust it is to different types of errors.

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

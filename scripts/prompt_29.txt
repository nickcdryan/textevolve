            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
            

            Here are example problems from previously seen data:

The script uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini LLM. The function calls are structured as follows: `identify_anchor_values` -> `analyze_neighborhood_influence` -> `transform_grid`, with the output of each function serving as input for the subsequent one; regex is used to extract the test input.

The AI struggles to internalize the mapping between input and output grids, specifically how values change and are positioned based on the provided training examples. The system fails to understand complex relational mappings that drive the transformation and results in inaccurate substitutions."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 20,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the **failure to correctly infer and apply the intended transformation rule from the training examples to the test input.** This stems from inadequate hypothesis generation and validation and a reliance on simple, incorrect transformations like flipping."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 21,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's failure to accurately identify and generalize the transformation pattern from the training examples.

  },
  {
    "iteration": 22,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is **incorrect value propagation and generation**, where the system hallucinates and propagates values that are outside of what exists in the dataset. This shows that its understanding of the transformation rule that it is supposed to implement is flawed."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 23,
    "issue": "The primary issue is **insufficient pattern recognition and generalization ability.** The system is unable to deduce the rules governing the transformation between the input and output grids in the training examples and then apply those rules correctly to the test input."

    "iteration": 24,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's **inability to correctly identify and extrapolate the transformation pattern from the training examples**. This is evident in all error cases where the system recognizes the transformation is incorrect but cannot produce the correct output."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 25,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the **fragility of the grid parsing mechanism**. The system is failing to correctly interpret the grid data due to minor syntax errors or inconsistencies in the string representation of the grids. This prevents any subsequent reasoning or transformation."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 26,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the **failure to reliably parse the output generated by the system**. This is evidenced by the consistent \"Error parsing extracted data: invalid syntax\" error. This parsing failure blocks the system from correctly interpreting its own responses and prevents proper evaluation and improvement."

]

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Optimize the implementation for performance:** Profile the code to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize critical sections. Use data structures and algorithms that are appropriate for the task and minimize unnecessary computations.",
  "Skip whitespace.",
  "Implement a more robust pattern recognition algorithm:** Explore techniques like convolution filters or graph-based approaches to better capture spatial relationships and transformations.",
  "Remove leading/trailing whitespace from each line.",
  "Remove extra spaces between numbers and commas.",
  "Handle missing commas by assuming adjacency implies a new element.",
  "Check for mismatched brackets and provide specific error messages including the location of the error.",
  "Introduce Intermediate Debugging:** Add print statements to display intermediate values during the grid transformation process. This will help in understanding the flow of data and identifying the source of errors. This will allow for a clearer understanding of why things go wrong and where the code is failing.",
  "Refine the transformation logic:** Implement a more precise and accurate algorithm for applying transformations based on identified patterns. Consider using rule-based systems or machine learning models to learn the transformations from the training data.",
  "Ensure consistent comma usage."

    # Example: Combining Multiple Patterns for Advanced Problem Solving

    ## Original Challenge
    Creating a system that can analyze complex text, identify key insights, and generate well-reasoned recommendations.

    ## Pattern Selection and Combination Strategy

    1. Start with Feature Extraction to identify key elements:
    ```python
    # Extract key information from input text
    extraction_prompt = f'''
    Analyze this text and extract key features:

    {input_text}

    Focus specifically on:
    - Main entities and their attributes
    - Relationships between entities
    - Explicit and implicit constraints
    - Quantitative data points
    - Key objectives and success criteria

    For each feature, explain why it's significant for the analysis.
    '''

    2. Apply Multi-Perspective Analysis with domain experts:
    ```python
    # Generate analyses from different expert perspectives
    perspectives = ["data_analyst", "domain_expert", "strategic_advisor"]
    perspective_analyses = []

    for perspective in perspectives:
        perspective_prompt = f'''
        As a {perspective}, analyze this situation:

        Input text: {input_text}

        Key features identified:
        {extracted_features}

        Provide a thorough analysis focusing on aspects a {perspective} would prioritize.
        Highlight insights that might be missed by other perspectives.

        Step 1: Identify key challenges and opportunities
        Step 2: Evaluate potential approaches

    ## Key Integration Points
    - Feature Extraction provides structured input for Multi-Perspective Analysis
    - Multi-Perspective Analysis feeds unified context to Chain-of-Thought
    - Self-Consistency ensures robustness of reasoning paths
    - Debate and Verification rigorously test and improve recommendations
    - Best-of-N Selection optimizes the final output format and content

    ## Benefits of Pattern Combination
    - Each pattern addresses different aspects of the complex problem
    - Later patterns build upon the outputs of earlier patterns
    - Verification catches issues that might be missed in a linear approach
    - Multiple perspectives create more robust solutions
    - Self-consistency reduces likelihood of spurious reasoning

    This example demonstrates how combining patterns creates a solution pipeline that's much more powerful than any single pattern alone, particularly for complex analytical and recommendation tasks.

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
           - If verification fails, send the output back into an earlier part of the pipeline with specific feedback from the error
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return solution_result["solution"]



        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step: this will help us debug
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails
        6. Crucially, verification should be used to catch errors in the processing pipeline and feed them back into an earlier part of the pipeline for refinement with feedback for a set number of attempts. Verification for its own sake isn't very helpful, especially as the final step.

PREVIOUSLY TRIED APPROACHES (LAST 5 SCRIPTS):

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 28 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script uses a multi-agent approach to solve grid transformation problems by iteratively identifying and verifying transformation patterns. It decomposes the problem into extracting data, selecting relevant examples, identifying a transformation pattern, verifying the pattern, and applying it to the test input. The agents include a data extractor, example selector, pattern identifier, pattern verifier, and transformation applier, all implemented using the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini LLM. The `main` function orchestrates this workflow, calling functions such as `extract_training_and_test_data`, `select_relevant_examples`, `identify_transformation_pattern`, `verify_transformation_pattern`, and `apply_transformation` in sequence to arrive at the final transformed grid.

Exploration: Iterative Pattern Identification and Verification with Dynamic Example Selection

Hypothesis: Iteratively identifying and verifying transformation patterns, guided by a dynamic selection of relevant training examples, will improve grid transformation performance. This strategy aims to address the challenges of incorrect pattern deduction and limited generalization by focusing on robust pattern identification and validation before applying the transformation to the test input.

This approach differs significantly from previous ones by:

1.  Iterative Refinement of Transformation Patterns: Focuses on improving the accuracy of identified transformation patterns through iterative refinement and verification, rather than relying on a single extraction step.
2.  Dynamic Selection of Relevant Training Examples: Selects relevant training examples based on similarity to the test input, enabling the system to focus on the most relevant information for the transformation.
3.  Verification of Transformation Patterns: Verifies transformation patterns by applying them to training examples and comparing the results with the expected outputs.
4.  Multi-Agent Orchestration: Uses multiple LLM agents with specialized roles, including a pattern identifier, a pattern verifier, and a transformation applier.

Approach: The script uses an ensemble approach to grid transformation by combining global and local transformation techniques, with dynamic weighting determined by the LLM. The problem is decomposed into extracting grids, applying global and local transformations using separate LLM calls, determining weights for each transformation, and finally combining them. The script employs an ensemble of LLM-driven agents, including roles such as grid extractor, global transformer, local transformer, weight determiner, and transformation combiner. The functions used are `extract_grids` (extracts grids from the question), `apply_global_transformation` (applies global transformations), `apply_local_transformation` (applies local transformations), `determine_weights` (determines weights for combining transformations), and `combine_transformations` (combines transformations based on weights); `main` orchestrates the calls to the above functions to generate the final transformation.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 25 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script uses a chain-of-thought approach to solve grid transformation problems by decomposing the task into feature identification, structural transformation, and value mapping, assigning each sub-problem to a focused LLM call. The script uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model, sending it specific prompts for each sub-problem. The main function, `main`, orchestrates the workflow by first calling `extract_grids` to parse the grid data, then `identify_features`, followed by `structural_transformation`, and finally `value_mapping`, returning the final transformed grid.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

Exploration: Decomposition with Targeted Sub-Problems.
Hypothesis: Decomposing grid transformation problems into specific sub-problems (feature identification, structural transformation, value mapping)
and assigning focused LLM calls to each will improve accuracy. By using validation checks at each stage, we can identify breaking points and fix them.

This approach differs significantly from previous ones by:
1. Decomposing the problem into three core, focused sub-problems with specific prompts for each.
2. Performing an explicit extraction of training grid inputs, outputs, and the testing grid inputs. This reduces the chance of parsing errors.
3. Explicit validation steps at each major phase of processing.
4. Directly transforming the test input to reduce the need for complex code.

# GRID TRANSFORMATION DATASET - RESEARCH LOG

This document serves as a running log of our learnings and experiments related to the grid transformation task. It focuses on concrete, dataset-specific insights and findings, rather than general system design principles.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Core Structure:** Input-Output Grid Pairs with Hidden Transformations. The core structure involves presenting the system with several input-output grid pairs (training examples) and then asking it to transform a new input grid based on the patterns learned from the examples. The transformations are not explicitly stated, requiring the system to infer the underlying rule.
*   **Grid Representation:** Grids are represented as lists of lists, with integer values representing colors/states.
*   **Value Range:** Values in grids tend to be small integers (0-9). Often these are binary grids or low integers reflecting the repetition. The value "4" is also frequently present.
*   **Grid Structure and Zero-Padding:** Questions consistently present grid transformation problems using 2D lists (matrices) filled predominantly with zeros and a few other integers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9). The large proportion of zeros often forms a "padding" or background, while the non-zero integers represent the "foreground" elements undergoing transformation. This suggests that the *relative position of non-zero elements within a sparse grid* is crucial for identifying transformation rules. Specific to some problems, the zeros either represent empty space or specific values within the grid. This ambiguity needs to be handled well.
*   **Question Structure:** Questions are formatted as a series of "Example Input Grid," "Example Output Grid" pairs, followed by a "Test Input" grid and the instruction to transform the test input. Each example is clearly labeled ("Example 1:", "Example 2:", etc."). Questions consistently follow a "TRAINING EXAMPLES ... TEST INPUT ... Transform the test input" structure. The number of examples varies in each question.
*   **Multi-Example Prompting Format:** Questions are formatted with "=== TRAINING EXAMPLES ===" followed by multiple "Example X: Input Grid:\n[...]\nOutput Grid:\n[...]" pairs. Then, "=== TEST INPUT ===\n[...]" and the prompt "Transform the test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples." This highlights the task's reliance on *few-shot learning*. The system's performance is directly tied to its ability to discern and generalize transformation rules from a small number of examples.
*   **Grid Dimensions:** The size of the input grids varies across examples within a single question. Within a single question, input and output grids may have consistent dimensions, but there is often some padding present. The answer grid's size is determined by the transformation pattern, and is not always the same as the input grid. Sizes range from small 3x3 grids to larger 21x21 grids, or even larger 30x30 grids. A key characteristic is the frequent change in grid dimensions between the input and output. The system must infer how the original grid is expanded or contracted. Extrapolating patterns to new grid sizes or element arrangements is a challenge.
*   **Transformation Focus:** Questions focus on spatial relationships and transformations of the grid's contents.
*   **Transformation Types:**
    *   **Grid Expansion/Replication:** The input grid is expanded into a larger grid, with values replicated based on the original pattern (e.g., Example 0 from initial analysis).
    *   **Conditional Value Modification:** Values within the grid are changed based on their position or the values of their neighbors (e.g., Examples 1, 2, 3, 4 from initial analysis). Rules are often spatial and relative.
    *   **Resizing/Reshaping:** Grid structure changes size or shape. Some examples involve cropping grids.
    *   **Shifting/Rearranging Subgrids:** A common pattern involves shifting or rearranging subgrids within the larger grid. The transformation often involves moving specific values or blocks of values to different locations.
    *   **Propagation:** A common pattern involves identifying specific numbers or shapes in the input grid and then propagating or transforming them in a structured way to generate the output grid (e.g., triangular propagation, mirroring). Transformations seem to follow a pattern of propagating values from certain "anchor" cells to their neighbors.
    *   **Counting Elements and Positional Changes**: Some transformations involve counting elements and altering their positions.
    *   **Copy and Paste:** A frequent pattern observed in the training examples is copying a specific value from one location of the grid to another based on defined conditions. This copying action often depends on finding specific "trigger" values within certain parts of the grid.
    *   **Row Swapping:** Transformations may involve swapping rows within the grid.
    *   **Color Reduction with Row Extraction:** Some transformations involve reducing colors and extracting specific rows.
    *   Rotations, reflections, element replacements based on position or value, or combinations of these. The complexity of these transformations is a key challenge.
    *   Combinations of the above are possible.
*   **Grid Structure and Repetition:** A key characteristic is the consistent presence of repeating patterns within these grids (rows, columns, or sub-grids with identical values). The training examples are crucial for demonstrating these patterns. Grids are frequently framed by a border of identical numbers. An example of incorrect replication occurred during iteration 19 with the system outputting a variation `[4, 4, 9, 9], [4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 9, 9], [9, 9, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [9, 9, 4, 4]` instead of repeating `[4,4,9,9],[4,4,4,4],[4,4,9,9]` as in the output.
*   **Transformation Logic Encoding:** The transformation logic is encoded implicitly within the relationship between the input and output grids of the training examples. This logic often involves identifying specific numbers or patterns in the input and replacing them with other numbers in predictable locations within the output grid.
*   **Transformation Logic Variety:** The transformation logic itself varies significantly between problems within the dataset. Some transformations involve propagating values to neighbors, others involve repeating columns, and still others might extract subgrids based on patterns found within the non-zero elements. This *diversity of transformation types* poses a significant challenge for a simple pattern matching approach, as a single, universal strategy is unlikely to succeed across the entire dataset. Transformations can be complex, involving changes to element values based on their position, neighboring values, or other intricate relationships. This complexity is dataset-specific; success relies on uncovering these non-obvious rules. The transformations often involve replicating rows/columns, rotating sections of the grid or altering values based on their position within the grid.
*   **Multi-Example Dependency:** Successfully extracting the transformation rule relies heavily on multiple training examples. A single example is often insufficient to disambiguate the underlying pattern. Test-time analysis of the training examples to dynamically adapt to the specific problem is crucial.
*   **Fill Patterns:** Many examples require a "fill" pattern, or reflecting values found in the input grid throughout the output grid with a certain symmetry.
*   **Spatial Transformations:** The transformation rules are spatial and involve manipulations of numbers within the grid based on their positions and values of neighboring cells. Transformations involve understanding spatial relationships between grid elements and applying operations based on those relationships (e.g., replicating patterns, shifting elements, identifying symmetrical structures).
*   **Limited Symbol Variety:** The grids use a limited set of symbols (integers, primarily), but the spatial arrangement and relationships between them are key.
*   **Core Transformation Logic:** The core challenge revolves around deciphering the transformation logic. This could involve shrinking/expanding the grid, changing values based on neighbors, or applying other spatial relationships.
*   **Local and Structural Transformations:** The transformations are often *local* and *structural*. That is to say that the correct answer can be obtained by observing local pattern changes. Contextualizing local changes within the entire grid structure is important.
*   **Inference of Transformation Type and Parameters:** The dataset uniquely requires the system to infer the *type* of transformation (shift, rotation, etc.) and the *parameters* (direction, amount) from a small number of examples.
*   **Varied Transformation Types:** The transformations are diverse, including but not limited to element shifting, pattern replication, counting elements and positional changes. This heterogeneity demands a flexible and adaptable transformation identification mechanism.
*   **Concise Output:** The output grid is often significantly smaller or has a fundamentally different structure than the input, indicating a summarization or feature extraction process rather than a simple pixel-level manipulation.
*   **Transformation patterns and relationships:** Transformation patterns often involve relationships between numbers in the input grid and their corresponding placement or modification in the output grid. These relationships can involve translating, rotating, or replacing specific values based on their context. An example of this is identifying that '7' and '4' get mapped to different places in the grid (Iteration 19). The LLM struggles to identify that the 7 and 4 numbers get mapped to other places in the matrix.
*   **Focus on sub-sections or features:** The grid sizes vary, with some examples involving full grid transformations and others focusing on specific sub-sections or features within the grid.
*   The transformation rules often involve identifying specific numbers in the input grid (e.g., 3, 5, 8) and changing the values of other cells based on the location of these identified numbers.
*   Training examples often involve the movement, duplication, or alteration of specific numbers (e.g., 7, 8, 5) within the grid. These numbers act as "trigger" elements for the transformation.
*   Transformations are often locally constrained, meaning the change in a cell depends on the value or position of neighboring cells (the "attractor" behavior).
*   A key characteristic is the presence of 'special' numbers within the grid (e.g., 8 in many examples), which often serve as anchors or triggers for the transformation rule. The rules often involve modifying neighboring cells based on the location and value of these special numbers.
*   **Symbolic Reasoning:** The transformations involve symbolic manipulation. Numbers within the grid don't represent quantities but rather *types* or *states* that are moved, replicated, or replaced based on context.
*   **Context-Dependent Rules:** Rules for transformation aren't universal but depend on the local neighborhood of a cell and its relationship to other cells with specific values. The system is unable to detect that '3' is removed, while 3's located at the bottom get replicated, indicating that the same numbers are transformed differently based on their location within the grid.
*   **Grid Transformations with Hidden Rules:** The dataset presents grid transformation problems where the relationship between input and output grids is not explicitly stated. The task requires identifying a hidden pattern or transformation rule from a set of training examples and applying it to a new test input grid.
*   **Abstraction and Spatial Relationships:** Many transformations involve understanding spatial relationships between grid elements and applying operations based on those relationships (e.g., replicating patterns, shifting elements, identifying symmetrical structures).
*   **Abstraction Level:** The task requires a high level of visual abstraction and pattern recognition. The system must infer the underlying rules of transformation from a limited number of examples.
*   **Varying Grid Sizes:** The grids in different examples and even within the same question can have varying dimensions (rows and columns). This adds complexity to pattern recognition (Iteration 19).
*   **Invariant and Variant Regions:** The grids often contain a mix of invariant regions and areas that undergo transformation, adding complexity (Iteration 22). The logic of what causes propagation and what values remain unchanged is not always clear (Iteration 22).
*   **Variety of Grid Contents:** Grids contain different data types (integers). Transformations may involve modifying specific integer values.
*   **Varying Transformation Complexity:** Transformations appear to range from simple value substitutions/additions based on location to more complex pattern-based changes that require identifying relationships between different grid elements.
*   **Analogy-Based Transformation:** Questions are explicitly framed as analogy problems, requiring the model to infer a transformation rule from training examples and apply it to a test input grid. The instructions include "Transform the test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples." This emphasizes the need for reasoning about relationships between grids.
*   **Limited Training Examples:** The questions include only a few (2-3) training examples. This necessitates robust few-shot learning capabilities and the ability to generalize from sparse data. The complexity of the transformations can vary, further compounding the challenge.
*   **Spatial Relationships and Transformations:** A common pattern involves spatial relationships and transformations of numerical values within the grids (e.g., expanding shapes, shifting values, or applying arithmetic operations based on neighboring cells).
*   **Varied Grid Dimensions:** The size and dimensions of the input and output grids can vary significantly across different examples, adding to the complexity of the task.
*   **Format Sensitivity:** The grid extraction process is highly sensitive to variations in input text formatting, including spacing, bracketing, and the presence of extraneous text.
*   **Implicit Rules:** The transformation rules are implicit and must be inferred from a small set of training examples, requiring advanced reasoning and generalization skills.
*   **Structure Dependency:** Transformations are not solely based on individual cell values but also on the spatial relationships between different regions or subgrids within the overall grid structure.
*   **Multi-Value Interactions:** The transformations often involve the interplay between multiple distinct values within the grid (e.g., how one number influences the placement or value of another). The relationships are not always simple adjacent replacements.
*   **Context-Dependent Rules:** The transformation rules are highly context-dependent. The same number might be transformed differently based on its location and surrounding numbers.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

**Promising Strategies:**

*   **Multi-Agent Approach:** The multi-agent approach, with specialized LLM agents for context identification, example selection, transformation application, and verification, shows promise. Decomposing the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks allows each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the transformation. (Iteration 11)
*   **Decomposition into sub-tasks (Analyze, Transform, Verify):** Breaking down the problem into distinct stages (analysis, transformation, verification) is a useful strategy. It allows for modular design and targeted application of LLM capabilities. (Iteration 17, Iteration 18)
*   **LLM Role Assignment:** Assigning specific roles (analyzer, transformer, verifier) to the LLM for each stage is helpful in guiding the LLM's reasoning process and leveraging its strengths in different areas. (Iteration 17)

**Ineffective Strategies:**

*   **Purely LLM-Driven Pattern Matching:** Relying solely on the LLM to directly learn and apply the transformation rules has proven unreliable. (See Experiment Log - Iteration 0). Demonstrated again in Iteration 1, 2, and 7 with 0% accuracy. The "exploitation" strategy, which relies on the LLM to directly translate examples into code, has also proven inadequate (Iteration 12). LLMs Alone are Insufficient - Relying solely on LLMs without incorporating algorithmic processing or numerical analysis leads to poor performance on tasks requiring precise grid transformations. Chain-of-thought prompting with LLMs also falls short in this category (Iteration 19).
*   **Multi-Example Prompting Alone:** Simply providing multiple examples in the prompt is not enough to solve the grid transformation problems reliably. The LLM, in its current form, lacks the capability to robustly extract and implement the correct transformation logic. (See Experiment Log - Iteration 2).
*   **Test-Time Training:** The "test-time training" approach, which relies on the LLM to develop and validate a hypothesis before applying it, was unsuccessful for this dataset. (See Experiment Log - Iteration 3).
*   **Explicit Positional Reasoning with Verification Loop:** Explicit positional reasoning, combined with a verification loop and feedback mechanism, has not improved accuracy. This suggests the LLM cannot effectively correlate errors with the extracted rule and adjust its reasoning accordingly (Iteration 4).
*   **Unconstrained Exploration Strategy:** A broad, unconstrained exploration strategy is not effective at solving the core transformation challenges without better constraints. (See Experiment Log - Iteration 5). The "Exploration" strategy, in its current implementation, doesn't lead to effective learning of transformation rules.
*   **Local Structural Motif Identification and Application (Iteration 6):** The approach of identifying and applying "local structural motifs" completely failed for this dataset, resulting in 0.0 accuracy. The hypothesis that identifying motifs and mapping their transformation provides a robust way to generalize transformations was rejected.
*   **LLM-driven decomposition approach (Iteration 8):** The LLM-driven decomposition approach, in its current form, is not effective for this dataset. The attempt to identify a transformable subgrid, derive transformation rules, and apply those rules failed.
*   **Exploration with Structured Rule Extraction and Iterative Refinement (Iteration 9):** The "exploration" strategy, involving LLM-based structured rule extraction and iterative refinement, did not achieve satisfactory accuracy (0.67). This suggests that the current approach to rule extraction and refinement is not robust enough to handle the complexity of the grid transformation patterns in this dataset. The hypothesis that structured representation and iterative refinement would significantly improve generalization was not supported.
*   **Exploration Strategy Ineffective (Iteration 10):** The exploration strategy, as implemented, has proven ineffective. The reliance on a single "grid transformation expert" LLM call for each step results in highly flawed solutions.
*   **Exploration based on minimal change identification and pattern interpolation (Iteration 13):** This strategy was unsuccessful, suggesting the dataset's transformation rules are too complex for this approach.
*   **Exploitation Strategy Ineffective (Iteration 14):** The exploitation strategy of using LLM-driven rule extraction, refinement, and application is insufficient for solving the grid transformation problems in the dataset.
*   **Value determination based on Location:** The system is prone to determining the target value to copy based purely on a single example. This results in hardcoding of the target value into the solution and an inability to generalize to new inputs. (Iteration 15)
*   **Exploitation Strategy Ineffective (Iteration 16):** The exploitation strategy failed to generalize learned patterns to unseen test cases. This suggests that the LLM-based rule extraction and refinement, while seemingly logical, struggles to capture the nuances of these grid transformations.
*   **Verification Stage Ineffective:** The verification step, while conceptually sound, isn't effective at catching the errors made during the transformation stage, suggesting issues with the verification criteria or LLM's ability to evaluate transformations.
*   **Hypothesis Generation and Validation Ineffective (Iteration 20):** Simply generating multiple hypotheses and validating them is insufficient to solve the grid transformation problems in this dataset.
    *   **Exploitation Strategy Ineffective (Iteration 21):** The exploitation strategy with this particular LLM-driven approach has been shown to result in zero accuracy.
    *   **Anchor-Based Propagation (Iteration 22):** The experiment rejects the hypothesis that simply identifying "anchor" values and propagating their influence using a single chain of LLM calls is sufficient for solving these grid transformation problems.
    *   **Meta-Reasoning Alone is Insufficient (Iteration 23):** The experiment rejected the hypothesis that meta-reasoning is able to solve the problem. The core issue lies in the inability to accurately discern and represent the underlying transformation rules, which the meta-reasoning framework can't compensate for.
    *   **Analogy-Based Approach Ineffective (Iteration 24):** The attempt to use analogy-based reasoning with dynamic example selection failed.
*   **Zero-Shot LLM Induction/Application (Iteration 26):** The experiment has rejected the hypothesis that LLMs can induce and apply complex transformation rules on grid-based problems in a zero-shot manner.
*   **Ensembling and Dynamic Weighting (Iteration 27):** This approach could not be properly evaluated due to the grid parsing failure but is suspected to be ineffective without robust grid extraction and accurate transformation logic.
*   **Exploration Ineffectiveness (Iteration 28):** Pure exploration, without structured guidance or constraints, results in a complete failure. The multi-agent system, despite its decomposition, cannot effectively learn from the examples without a more directed approach to pattern recognition.
*   Currently, with an accuracy of 0.0 (Iteration 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28), no strategy stands out as particularly effective. Further iterations and analysis are needed to identify successful techniques.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Fragile Grid Parsing:** The primary failure mode is the inability of the system to reliably parse the grid data from the text-based input. This often results from subtle inconsistencies in the way the grids are formatted (e.g., inconsistent spacing, missing brackets), which prevents the subsequent analysis and transformation steps. This fragility invalidates more complex chain-of-thought approaches. A key manifestation of this is the inability of the system to reliably parse its *own output* into a valid grid format, due to inconsistencies or errors in the generated text, leading to "invalid syntax" errors during the `ast.literal_eval` operation.
*   **Inability to handle variability in grid size:** The approach fails to generalize across different grid sizes because the structural transformation logic is not flexible enough to adapt to varying dimensions.
*   **Lack of Error Handling:** The code does not include sufficient error handling for cases where the Gemini model returns unexpected or malformed results, leading to program termination rather than graceful recovery.
*   **Pattern Extraction Failure:** The core failure lies in the LLM's inability to accurately extract and generalize the transformation pattern from the training examples. The model generates outputs drastically different from the expected golden answers. For instance, it produces simple diagonal matrices when a complex grid transformation is required. For example, given the training examples:
    ```
    === TRAINING EXAMPLES === Example 1:
    Input Grid:
    [[3, 1, 2],
     [3, 1, 2],
     [3, 1, 2]]

    Output Grid:
    [[4, 5, 6],
     [4, 5, 6],
     [4, 5, 6]]

    Example 2:
    Input Grid:
    [[2, 3, 8],
     [2, 3, 8],
     [2, 3, 8]]

    Output Grid:
    [[6, 4, 9],
     [6, 4, 9],
     [6, 4, 9]]

    Example 3:
    Input Grid:
    [[5, 8, 6],
     [5, 8, 6],
     [5, 8, 6]]

    Output Grid:
    [[1, 9, 2],
     [1, 9, 2],
     [5, 8, 6]]

    Example 4:
    Input Grid:
    [[9, 4, 2],
     [9, 4, 2],
     [9, 4, 2]]

    Output Grid:
    [[8, 3, 6],
     [8, 3, 6],
     [8, 3, 6]]

    === TEST INPUT ===
    [[8, 1, 3],
     [8, 1, 3],
     [8, 1, 3]]

    Transform the test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples.
    ```
    The expected output is "[[9,5,4],[9,5,4],[9,5,4]]" but the LLM often returns a diagonal matrix or other incorrect output. Insufficient Pattern Interpretation - The script struggles to accurately decipher the transformation pattern from the training examples. The predicted output grid often bears little resemblance to the expected one, indicating a failure to grasp the underlying transformation logic.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Deduction:** The LLM fails to generalize the transformation rule from the examples. Instead of identifying the core transformation logic, the model focuses on superficial correlations or repetitions. The LLM struggles to correctly identify and formalize the underlying transformation rules. Instead of capturing the general pattern, it makes flawed assumptions about the relationships between numbers and cell locations.
*   **Inability to Handle Complex Rules:** The model struggles with transformations that involve more than simple element-wise operations or direct spatial relationships. Examples with more intricate patterns result in incorrect outputs. When the transformation rules involve multiple conditions or dependencies (e.g., changing a cell's value based on the presence of multiple numbers in specific locations), the LLM fails to correctly encode this complexity in the code. It can handle single conditions but struggles with combinations.
*   **Sensitivity to Noise:** The model is susceptible to "noise" in the examples.
*   **Ambiguity:** The training examples might not perfectly define the transformation. There could be multiple plausible rules.
*   **Generalization:** The model needs to generalize the rule to the test input, which might have different dimensions or arrangements. The LLM struggles with generalizing from examples. A small set of training examples, especially when the transformations are complex, is insufficient for the LLM to build a reliable understanding.
*   **Text Parsing/Representation:** Converting the text-based grid representation into a usable data structure (without brittle JSON parsing) is a challenge.
*   **Computational Complexity:** Naive implementations of grid transformations can be computationally expensive, especially for larger grids.
*   **Edge Cases/Complexities:**
    *   **Empty Grids:** What happens when the input grid is empty or contains only zeros?
    *   **Varying Input Sizes:** How does the rule adapt when the input grid dimensions are significantly different from the training examples?
    *   **Multiple Transformations:** Can a single question involve both grid expansion *and* value modification?
    *   **Symmetry/Rotation:** Are there cases where the transformation involves rotation or reflection of the grid?
    *   **Color/Value Dependencies:** Does the transformation depend on specific color values or their relationships (e.g., "if a cell is surrounded by color X, change it to color Y")?
*   **Incorrect Value Substitution:** The LLM struggles to correctly identify *which* values need to be substituted and *what* they should be replaced with. For instance, it might misinterpret the training examples and apply a substitution rule to the wrong numbers, leading to incorrect values in the output grid.
*   **Extrapolation and Dimensionality Errors:** The LLM incorrectly extrapolated patterns in the training data, generating larger grids than expected in the test output. This indicates a failure to respect dimensionality constraints. The system sometimes fails to predict the right output dimensions, and cannot accurately transform input grids to output grids.
*   **Lack of Contextual Awareness:** The LLM failed to account for context within the grid. For example, the examples above show a test input that differs from the training examples. The LLM failed to generalize between these scenarios.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Recognition from Limited Examples:** The primary failure mode stems from the LLM's inability to accurately deduce the underlying transformation rule from the few provided training examples. For instance, the model misinterpreting the transformation logic, failing to propagate non-zero values to the correct neighboring locations. This indicates a limitation in the LLM's *reasoning and generalization abilities* when faced with complex spatial relationships.
*   **Incorrect Code Translation of (Misunderstood) Patterns:** Even when the LLM identifies a plausible pattern, it often struggles to translate this understanding into correct and executable code. The generated code inaccurately implements the intended neighbor propagation logic, yielding an incorrect output grid. This highlights a disconnect between *pattern recognition and procedural implementation.*
*   **Sensitivity to Grid Dimensions and Element Distribution:** The transformations appear to be sensitive to specific grid dimensions and the spatial arrangement of non-zero elements. The system incorrectly repeats column values across the grid, misinterpreting the rule based on the distribution of values within the provided examples. This suggests a need for *robust strategies that are invariant to irrelevant grid properties.*
*   **Pattern Recognition is a Bottleneck:** The failure to accurately identify the transformation pattern is a significant bottleneck. Even when the model attempts to generate code based on a (flawed) understanding of the pattern, the resulting output is incorrect. The ability of LLMs to do pattern matching on complex inputs is suspect. The system appears to be identifying *some* patterns, but the patterns identified are not accurate representations of the transformations occurring.
*   **Grid Size Discrepancy:** The LLM sometimes fails to produce an output grid of the same dimensions as the expected output. This suggests an issue with understanding or adhering to the grid structure. This is exemplified in the case where the system outputs a 3x3 matrix while the golden answer is a 21x21 matrix. Handling Dimensionality Changes - The LLM often struggles to predict the size and shape of the output grid when the dimensions change. It may not correctly infer the expansion or contraction factors or how the elements should be arranged in the new grid.
*   **Ignoring Input Data:** The LLM-generated responses often bear little to no resemblance to the input grids, indicating that the model is not effectively utilizing the provided information to guide its transformations.
*   **Hallucination:** The LLM outputs grids that have nothing to do with the original input, suggesting the LLM hallucinates or has problems with reasoning.
*   **Incorrect Rule Extraction (Iteration 4):** The LLM struggles to extract accurate transformation rules from the training examples. The agent fails to generalize and capture the underlying logic of the grid transformations. For example, when presented with a fill grid, the LLM misinterpreted what values to fill and where, leading to an empty grid or seemingly random numbers in the output.
*   **Positional Reasoning Errors (Iteration 4):** Positional reasoning alone is not enough to ensure accurate transformations. The positional reasoning approach does not prevent the LLM from making errors in applying rules based on the positions of numbers in the grid.
*   **Verification Loop Ineffectiveness (Iteration 4):** The verification loop does not effectively refine the extracted rules, indicating that the feedback mechanism is not sufficient to correct the LLM's errors. The LLM lacks the capacity to correlate the error with the rule and adjust accordingly.
*   **Unreliable String to Integer Conversion (Iteration 5):** The system fails when it cannot reliably convert string representations of grid values into integers. This suggests the LLM sometimes introduces formatting issues or unexpected characters when extracting cell values or transformation rules.
*   **Reasoning Errors About Grid Transformations (Iteration 5):** The model struggles to derive the correct transformation rules from the training examples, leading to either incorrect output grids or an "Invalid transformation" error, indicating the system couldn't determine a consistent rule.
*   **Cell-by-cell Approach Bottleneck (Iteration 5):** Relying directly on the LLM for both cell analysis and transformation without proper validation/filtering leads to inconsistencies.
*   **Inability to Abstract Transformation Logic (Iteration 6):** The LLM struggles to go beyond superficial pattern matching to extract the underlying *logic* behind the grid transformations. For example, it might recognize that a '1' in the input leads to a row of '1's in the output, but fail to understand *why* or *where* that row should be placed relative to the input grid.
*   **Motif Extraction Ambiguity (Iteration 6):** The LLM fails to identify the relevant motifs in the training examples and how these motifs are transformed to generate the output grid. This causes it to apply the wrong transformations to the test input, resulting in a completely different matrix. For example, it may identify a motif, but the transformation rule applied is wrong (it might assume a number changes to a "3", when that is incorrect).
*   **Output Shape/Dimensionality Errors (Iteration 6)**: The generated output grids often have a different shape or dimensionality than the expected output. This indicates a fundamental failure in understanding how the transformation affects the overall structure of the grid, not just the values within it.
*   **Spatial Relationship Misinterpretation (Iteration 7):** The LLM struggles to accurately translate spatial relationships between grid elements into code. For example, identifying that 2s must appear to the left and above 1s, but failing to implement code to generate 2s in all necessary places.
*   **Pattern Generalization Failure (Iteration 7):** The LLM struggles to generalize patterns observed in training examples to the test input grid. For example, the LLM fails to identify how the values in the test grid should be transformed by incorrectly identifying "the value 3 as a key".
*   **Output Grid Structure Problems (Iteration 7):** LLM fails to recognize changes to the overall structure in the transformed grid (e.g., changes to grid size).
*   **Incorrect Value Placement/Shifting (Iteration 8):** The core issue is the LLM's failure to accurately generalize the transformation rules and apply them to the test input. For example, values are placed in the wrong locations.
*   **Incorrect Transformation Rule Identification (Iteration 8)**: The LLM seems to either fail to identify the correct transformation rule or provides a rule that doesn't represent a transformation, instead providing a separate grid.
*   **Pattern Recognition and Translation (Iteration 9):** The primary failure lies in the agent's difficulty in accurately recognizing complex visual patterns and translating them into precise code logic. For example, the agent struggles to deduce the exact rules governing the placement and propagation of numbers in the output grid based on their location in the input grid.
*   **Incorrect Rule Application (Iteration 9):** Even when a general rule is identified, the agent often fails to implement it correctly in code. This leads to transformations that don't match the expected output (e.g., the code in the first failure case attempts to create a triangular transformation but does so incorrectly, resulting in the wrong output grid).
*   **Difficulty Translating Visual Intuition into Algorithmic Rules (Iteration 9):** The current error patterns highlight the difficulty of translating visual intuition into precise algorithmic rules.
*   **Incorrect Transformation Logic Identification (Iteration 10):** The primary failure occurs in the `identify_core_transformation_logic` function. The LLM fails to accurately deduce the underlying rule from the provided training examples. This leads to the generation of incorrect or incomplete transformation rules. For instance, in the first error example, the code incorrectly identifies a diagonal shifting pattern.
*   **Inadequate Verification (Iteration 10):** The `verify_transformation_logic` function does not adequately catch the errors in the identified transformation logic. This could be due to insufficient test cases or a flawed verification process that relies on the same faulty logic.
*   **Brittle Algorithm Implementation (Iteration 10):** Even when a transformation rule is partially correct, the implemented algorithm in `apply_transformation_to_test_input` may be too brittle or specific, failing to generalize to unseen inputs. The LLM generates iterative, step-wise logic, that fails to generalize to all the training examples, let alone the test input.
*   **Inability to Generalize Transformation Rules (Iteration 11):** The system often fails to accurately apply the transformation logic learned from the training examples to the test input. For example, the system incorrectly places a value in the output grid because it couldn't identify the correct pattern for number placement based on the examples (Error example 1 in Iteration 11).
*   **Difficulty in Handling Complex Patterns (Iteration 11):** When transformations involve multiple factors or subtle dependencies, the system struggles to produce the correct output. For example, the system failed to consistently modify values based on their surrounding context, leading to incorrect changes in specific grid locations (Error example 2 in Iteration 11).
*   **Overfitting to Training Examples:** The approach fails when the LLM extracts overly specific rules that are directly tied to the training examples' grid configurations but do not generalize to the test input. For example, instead of learning a general rule about relative positions of numbers, the LLM might hardcode specific row and column indices to apply transformations, which will obviously fail on the test input if the numbers appear in different locations.
*   **Inaccurate Rule Extraction (Iteration 13):** The LLM agents failed to accurately extract and generalize the transformation rules from the training examples. The complexity of the rules, involving conditional logic and spatial relationships between numbers, overwhelmed the current approach.
*   **Verification Failure (Iteration 13):** The "verify_transformation" step frequently flagged incorrect transformations, demonstrating a good capacity to *identify* errors, but a poor ability to *correctly generate* transformations. The LLM could articulate why a proposed output was wrong, but couldn't then produce a correct output. This suggests a disconnect between understanding the rules and applying them.
*   **Limited Generalization (Iteration 13):** The model struggled to generalize from the limited number of training examples, especially when the transformations involved subtle variations or combinations of rules. The model correctly identified a rule about "attractors," but incorrectly applied it to the entire grid.
*   **Incorrect Rule Generalization (Iteration 14):** The model often fails to generalize the transformation rule from the training examples. For instance, the model misinterpreted the pattern and populated the entire grid with the number 4, instead of extracting the 6s and their spatial relationship.
*   **Inability to handle varied grid sizes (Iteration 14):** The model seems to have trouble to generate output grids with proper dimensions, especially when

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

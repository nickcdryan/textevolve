            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
            

            Here are example problems from previously seen data:

  {
    "iteration": 23,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the **incorrect output formatting**. The system does not produce a nested list (list of lists) as required for the grid output. This could be due to a Type error. It may be worth investigating if it is coercing the structure into the wrong format."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 24,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the **incorrect JSON formatting** and **inability to correctly extrapolate and apply complex transformations** observed in the training examples. The incorrectly formatted JSON invalidates most of the attempted solutions, and the inability to extrapolate and apply the transformations means even if the formatting was correct, the output would still be wrong."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 25,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's failure to *accurately abstract and generalize grid transformation rules* from the provided training examples. This leads to the generation of incorrect code that doesn't correctly transform the input grid according to the desired pattern."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 26,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's inconsistency in generating the final transformed grid after reasoning about the patterns. The system seems to stop at the descriptive stage, implying a disconnect between understanding the transformation logic and actually implementing it."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 27,
    "issue": "The single most critical problem is **inaccurate pattern interpretation and subsequent rule extraction**. The system frequently identifies patterns that are only partially correct or misinterprets the nature of the transformation (e.g., reflection, rotation, propagation). This leads to the derivation of incorrect rules that fail to generalize to the test input. The analysis of example 0 shows that even relatively simple corner rotation is improperly executed."

]

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data with variations of the existing examples, such as rotated, flipped, or scaled versions of the grids. This could help the system learn to generalize the transformations to different grid sizes and arrangements.",
  "Spatial Reasoning Module:** Implement a dedicated module for spatial reasoning, capable of analyzing grid layouts, identifying shapes, and understanding spatial relationships between elements.",
  "Introduce Print Statements:** Add print statements that allows intermediate outputs to be viewed. This will allow a developer to step-by-step reproduce why the system went wrong.",
  "More Careful Analysis of Training Cases:** The system appears to be applying a range of transformations, but some of them are wrong. It is incorrectly mapping from column 6 in the training examples to column 9 in the test example, and the propagation rules are also inaccurate.",
  "Intermediate Representation Visualization:** Introduce intermediate representations (e.g., heatmaps showing the frequency of value occurrences at different positions, or dependency graphs highlighting relationships between grid cells).",
  "Add Error Logging:** Log any errors or inconsistencies detected during the rule verification process. This will help track the frequency and types of errors that occur.",
  "Incorporate spatial reasoning techniques:** Explore methods for incorporating spatial reasoning into the system, such as using convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks to model the relationships between different cells in the grid.",
  "Introduce a more robust pattern recognition and abstraction module:** This module should be able to identify and extract the core transformation rules from the training examples, representing them in a more abstract and generalizable form. For instance, using a convolutional neural network to extract common patterns, or a graphical representation of patterns.",
  "Pattern Encoding:** Explore techniques for encoding patterns in a more structured and expressive way, allowing for more complex transformations to be represented. Consider using graph representations or symbolic representations.",
  "Augmented Training Data:** Increase the diversity and complexity of training examples to expose the system to a wider range of patterns and transformations."

    Design a data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:

    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}

        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 31 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script addresses grid transformation problems by employing an LLM to identify visual anchors, infer transformation rules based on these anchors, and then apply these rules to generate a transformed grid. The problem is decomposed into three main steps: identifying anchors, inferring rules, and applying the transformation, each handled by a dedicated function. There are no distinct agent roles, instead the functions `identify_visual_anchors`, `infer_transformation_rules`, and `apply_transformation` sequentially use the `call_llm` function with specific system instructions and prompts to leverage the LLM's reasoning capabilities at each step, with `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrating the overall process. The overall workflow is `solve_grid_transformation` -> (`identify_visual_anchors` -> `call_llm`), (`infer_transformation_rules` -> `call_llm`), (`apply_transformation` -> `call_llm`).

```python

# EXPLORATION: Visual Anchor Identification and Transformation Rule Application with Adaptive Example Selection and Validation
# HYPOTHESIS: The LLM can better generalize grid transformations by first identifying "visual anchors" (stable elements) in the grid,
# then inferring transformation rules relative to those anchors. The approach also uses an adaptive example selection strategy,
# choosing relevant training examples based on similarity to the input grid, and includes detailed validation steps to ensure the LLM
# is producing valid outputs. We will validate different parts of the pipeline to identify which part is failing.

The LLM acts as an expert in both feature analysis and transformation application.

*   **`solve_grid_transformation`**: Orchestrates the solution by calling `analyze_visual_features` and `apply_transformation`.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 28 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script solves grid transformation problems using a structured approach with the LLM acting as an expert in region identification, pattern inference, and template completion. It decomposes the problem into three main steps: identifying key regions in the grid, inferring the swapping pattern between these regions, and completing a grid template based on the pattern. The LLM is prompted with specific system instructions for each step to guide its reasoning. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates the process, calling `identify_key_regions`, `infer_swapping_pattern`, and `complete_template` sequentially, with each function using `call_llm` to interact with the LLM. `call_llm` handles the API call to the LLM and returns the text response.

Approach: The script uses a meta-reasoning agent to dynamically select a strategy for solving grid transformation problems. The problem is decomposed into strategy selection and strategy application. Two agent roles are involved: a meta-reasoning agent for strategy selection and a strategy execution agent. Other functions used are `call_llm` to interact with the LLM and `solve_grid_transformation` to orchestrate the process.

The workflow is as follows: `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which calls `select_strategy` to choose a strategy using `call_llm`, and then calls `apply_chosen_strategy` to apply the selected strategy, again using `call_llm`, and returns the transformed grid.

            LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, I've synthesized the existing knowledge with the new learnings from Iteration 31, ensuring all existing information is preserved, the document length is reduced and the focus remains on concrete, task-specific insights for the Grid Transformation Task dataset.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   **Question Format:** "Grid Transformation Tasks" with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" (input/output grid pairs labeled "Input Grid," "Output Grid") and a "TEST INPUT" grid. Objective: generate the "OUTPUT GRID" for the test input, following patterns from the training examples.
*   **Consistent Structure:** Header, training examples, test input, transformation instruction.
*   **Grid Representation:** Nested lists of integers (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`). Dimensions vary (e.g., 10x10, 17x17). Grids are typically small matrices of integers, often with a background value (e.g., 0) and a few other distinct values that participate in transformations. Input/Output grid dimensions are consistent within a question, but may vary between training and test grids.
*   **Mixed Element Types:** Grids contain zeros and other numerical values.
*   **Abstracted Transformations:** Transformations are implicit and must be inferred. Identifying content-based and spatial patterns is critical. Transformations often involve replacing numbers based on their position relative to other numbers or patterns. The key is to identify the replacement "targets" and their new values based on context from training examples.
*   **Transformation Logic:** The core challenge is identifying transformation logic, often involving spatial manipulations (e.g., shifts, expansions, alternating patterns, boundary adherence, region swapping). Rules are often *localized* or dependent on subgrid characteristics. New elements can be placed at new locations based on spatial relationships. Transformations are not simple element-wise operations, involving relationships within the grid. Some grids leave parts unchanged, adding to the complexity of identifying what should be modified.
*   **Implicit Rules:** Transformation logic is *never* explicitly stated.
*   **Few-Shot Learning Format:** Questions are presented in a few-shot format.
*   **Varying Grid Sizes:** Transformations might be size-dependent. Output grid size may differ from input grid. LLM struggles with size differences.
*   **Multiple Possible Rules:** Different transformations might yield similar training results but diverge on the test data.
*   **Value Dependencies:** A cell's new value may depend on multiple other cells.
*   **Asymmetric Transformations:** Transformation might not be symmetrical.
*   **Value Encoding:** Values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9) have semantic meaning related to the transformation.
*   **Element Distribution:** Performance impacted by different element distributions. Sparse (mostly zeros) vs. dense patterns exist.
*   **Limited Training Examples:** Limited examples (typically 1-3) make generalization challenging.
*   **Zero Prevalence:** Many grids contain significant zeros. Non-zero values often represent distinct visual elements.
*   **Limited Integer Values:** Grids contain a limited set of integer values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8).
*   **Varied Transformation Rules:** Diverse rules ranging from neighbor-based replacement to tiling/replication patterns.
*   **Combined transformations:** Struggles with multiple rules within a single grid, combining copying and fill values, or performing different transformations simultaneously.
*   **Implicit spatial relationships:** Struggles to discern spatial aspects and accurately capture how the grid modifies elements and positions.
*   **Rotations/Reflections:** Transformations can involve element rotations, reflections, or more complex pattern propagations.
*   **Pattern Complexity:** Patterns involve region swapping and number replacements. The complexity varies significantly; some patterns are simple row/column shifts or substitutions, while others involve non-linear transformations or combinations of changes in subgrids.
*   **Element-wise transformations:** Training examples demonstrate element-wise transformations based on visual features and patterns within the grid. Specific numbers might trigger changes in neighboring cells, or overall arrangements of numbers could imply a transformation.
*   **Small Integers:** Grids contain small integers, and tasks often involve identifying relationships between different numbers within the grid (e.g., 5s causing modifications to 0s or 1s).

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   **No consistently effective strategy:** Given consistently low accuracy, no single strategy has emerged as reliably effective (Iterations 22-31: Accuracy <= 0.33).
*   **LLM-based Visual Feature Analysis (Potentially Useful):** Using an LLM to analyze visual features and infer transformation rules is a promising approach, but generalization remains a major challenge. Decomposing the problem into visual feature analysis and transformation application is potentially sound, *if* the model can accurately perform the feature analysis.
*   **Two-Step LLM Approach (Potentially Useful):** The two-step LLM approach (analyze then apply) shows some promise, but is still insufficient for reliable generalization.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Specialized Agents (Inconsistent):** The chain-of-thought approach, with specialized expert agents for visual feature analysis and transformation application, shows promise but suffers from inconsistent performance due to the LLM's issues with generalization.
*   **Decomposition (Helpful):** Breaking down the problem into analyzing visual features and applying the transformation simplifies the task.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Multi-Example Prompts (Helpful):** Chain-of-thought prompting with multi-example prompts has been helpful in guiding the LLM to recognize patterns, but improvements are needed. Multi-example prompting, while providing more context, does not guarantee accurate pattern recognition or transformation application.
*   **Analogical Reasoning (Potentially Useful):** The analogical reasoning approach demonstrates potential in pattern recognition, but has not achieved high accuracy.
*   **Proper API Configuration (Critical):** API configuration is paramount for any LLM-based strategy to function. The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable must be correctly set, and the chosen LLM model (e.g., 'gemini-pro') must be accessible. LLM access failure due to API configuration issues (Iteration 12).
*   **LLM-guided recursive subdivision (Potentially Useful):** If transformations are locally consistent, then LLM-guided recursive subdivision *might* have potential.
*   **Coordinate-based transformation rules generated from an LLM (Potentially Useful):** At a basic level the LLM is able to correctly identify locations of numbers.
*   **Code Generation approach:** The LLM is successful at generating Python code to manipulate the grid data structures.
*   **Neighbor detection:** The model attempts to look at neighbors and perform transformations based on neighbor values.
*   **Region Identification (Potentially Useful):** The general idea of region identification might be useful.

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **Pattern Generalization:** The primary failure is the inability to generalize from training examples to the test input. The model seems to overfit the training examples, memorizing specific transformations rather than inferring the underlying logic. For example, if the training examples involve shifting a region to the right, the model may fail if the test input requires a shift to the left or a more complex transformation. LLM struggles to generalize from the training examples to unseen test inputs. Even when training examples appear similar, the LLM fails to apply the learned transformation correctly, indicating a lack of robust pattern understanding.
*   **Incorrect Rule Abstraction/Incomplete Transformations:** Inability to accurately infer the transformation rule from limited examples and then implement it. Often *describes* the rules but fails to *implement* them, stopping at outlining observed patterns. Sometimes, expansion logic favors certain values, leading to structurally dissimilar grids.
*   **Descriptive vs. Implementational Gap:** The agent can often *describe* the transformation rules but fails to *implement* them to produce the final numerical grid.
*   **Halting at Structural Similarity:** Gets stuck in a loop of assessing and refining structural similarity, never producing the concrete numerical output.
*   **Incorrect Output Format:** Consistently fails to produce a nested list.
*   **Incorrect JSON Formatting:** Frequently produces invalid JSON (backticks, quotation marks, extra nesting, leading/trailing whitespace).
*   **Inability to Extrapolate Complex Transformations:** Struggles to generalize from training examples, especially with complex spatial reasoning.
*   **Incorrect Content Transformation:** Fails to accurately identify and apply correct number transformations.
*   **Numerical Mapping Errors:** Fails to consistently map numbers correctly, memorizing specific number-to-number transformations instead of extracting underlying logic.
*   **Spatial Configuration Misinterpretation:** Struggles to discern the spatial aspects of the transformations.
*   **Output Grid Dimension Errors:** Generates output grids with incorrect dimensions.
*   **Null Value Handling:** Encounters `None` values during numerical comparisons.
*   **Unexpected Input Values**: Inconsistencies in input data format not properly validated.
*   **Empty Output Grid:** Returns an empty list `[[]]`.
*   **Inability to Generate Valid Output:** Fails to capture underlying patterns and apply them to the test input.
*   **Complex Reasoning:** Struggles with questions requiring complex spatial or value dependency reasoning.
*   **Over-Reliance on Memorization:** Memorizes training examples rather than generalizing transformation logic.
*   **Inability to Abstract Complex Rules:** Requires abstraction of non-linear relationships and contextual dependencies.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Generalization:** Fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation patterns.
*   **Incorrect Application:** Even when the LLM correctly identifies the transformation, it struggles to apply it to the test input.
*   **Lack of Spatial Precision:** Struggles with precise spatial relationships, failing to place transformed elements correctly.
*   **Dimensionality Mismatch:** Generates output grids with incorrect dimensions.
*   **Shape and Dimensionality Errors:** Generated output grids often have incorrect shapes or dimensions.
*   **Output Format Mismatch:** Output grid does not match the expected size or shape.
*   **Incorrect Value Mapping:** Fails to map values correctly.
*   **Incorrect Element Replacement:** Identifies correct structure but uses wrong numbers.
*   **Value Errors:** Generates grids containing numbers not present in the target grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** Outputs Python code rather than the grid itself.
*   **Ambiguity:** Transformations are implicit and can be interpreted in multiple ways.
*   **Complexity:** Transformations involve combinations of replication, shifting, value changes, etc.
*   **Inability to Extract Accurate Transformation Rules:** Consistently fails to extract accurate and generalizable rules.
*   **Fragility of Pattern Recognition:** Pattern recognition is fragile and easily disrupted by small variations.
*   **Lack of Rule Validation:** Rule validation is not robust enough. The verification loop, as implemented, is not effective at detecting and correcting errors in the LLM's reasoning or transformation application.
*   **Localized Contextual Analysis Insufficient:** Struggles to generalize local rules across the entire grid.
*   **Oversimplification of Transformations:** Tends to oversimplify transformation rules.
*   **Complex Rule Interpretation:** Struggles with multiple intertwined rules.
*   **Incomplete Generalization:** Fails to accurately generalize rules based on limited examples.
*   **In-place vs. New Object Confusion:** Confused with modifying the input grid vs. creating a new output grid.
*   **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** Flawed mirroring logic leads to incorrect placements.
*   **Positional Transformation Neglect:** Unable to accurately capture how elements and positions change.
*   **Difficulty with complex value dependencies:** Struggles when the transformation relies on complex relationships between values.
*   **Misinterpretation of spatial relationships:** Incorrectly interprets how objects and values are spatially related.
*   **Misinterpretation of Visual Features:** `analyze_visual_features` prone to misinterpreting key features.
*   **Inconsistent Transformation Application:** Inconsistent application of identified rules.
*   **Ambiguous Transformations:** Training examples might have multiple interpretations.
*   **Error in output format**: Correct reasoning, but incorrect grid size or text output instead of code.
*   **Dimensionality and Element Distribution:** Fails with different dimensions or element distributions.
*   **Error in Transformation:** LLM produces an error rather than a valid transformation.
*   **Overfitting to Superficial Patterns:** Overfits to simple patterns (Iteration 13).
*   **Inability to Generalize Complex Rules:** Struggles with complex rules involving relationships between elements or regions (Iteration 13).
*   **Output validation inadequate:** Relying on an LLM for output validation may be flawed.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Identification:** LLM fails to correctly identify the transformation pattern.
*   **Inability to Handle Number Transformations:** Struggles with generalizing number transformations. For example, in the first failed example from Iteration 30, the LLM failed to correctly interpret the spatial relationships between the numbers within the grid and how those relationships should change in the transformation.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** Generated code contains logical errors or fails to translate the pattern.
*   **Ignoring Existing Grid Values:** Struggles with transformations requiring *both* copying and fill values.
*   **Context-Switching Errors:** Struggles to perform different transformations in the same grid.
*   **No Fallback Mechanisms:** Lacks robust error handling or fallback mechanisms.
*   **Lack of Output Constraints:** Not constrained to produce valid numerical grids.
*   **Incorrect coordinate application:** Coordinate transformation misapplied.
*   **Combined Analytical and Application Complexity:** Requires perfect output format which is difficult to guarantee.
*   **Misinterpretation of Patterns:** Model incorrectly identified a pattern.
*   **Incorrect Transformation Implementation:** Implements incorrect code.
*   **Limitation of Simple CoT:** LLM unable to correctly interpret the problem transformation.
*   **Incorrect Corner Rotation:** Model identifies clockwise corner rotation but applies it incorrectly.
    *   **Misinterpreting Non-Zero Value Patterns:** Model struggles to decipher patterns in grids with non-zero values.
    *   **Faulty Reflection Logic:** Meta-reasoning agent fails to identify proper reflection.
    *   **Incorrect Region Identification/Transformation:** The LLM fails to identify key regions and the correct swapping pattern, leading to incorrect transformations of rows and columns. The LLM misinterprets the relevant features in the grids, failing to identify consistent regions and corresponding transformation rules between input and output grids. For example, in the second failed example from Iteration 30, the failure often results in generating grids that are entirely different in size, or that make seemingly random changes.
*   **Matrix summarization/reduction instead of transformation:** The system consistently failed by outputting small, summarized matrices (e.g., 2x2) instead of transforming the full input grid based on the provided examples.
*   **Ignoring the input grid's dimensions:** The system failed to preserve the size/dimensions of the input grid during transformation.
*   **Incorrect Anchor Identification:** The LLM fails to accurately identify stable "visual anchors" or misinterprets their role in the transformation. If the "anchor" is incorrectly perceived as a corner of a pattern, the subsequent transformation will be misaligned in the test grid.
*   **Faulty Rule Inference:** Even with correct anchors, the LLM struggles to infer the transformation rule, leading to incorrect replacement logic. For instance, the LLM might infer that "all 1s near a 2 should become 2s" when the actual rule is more nuanced (e.g., "only 1s *above* a 2 should become 2s").

The hypothesis that LLMs can generalize transformations better by identifying visual anchors and inferring relative transformation rules is rejected, given the current implementation.

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

*   **Ensure output grid size consistency:** Constrain the `apply_transformation` function to *always* produce an output grid with the *exact* same dimensions as the input grid.

This could involve providing more explicit instructions to the LLM about what constitutes a good anchor or using a different method for anchor selection altogether (e.g., a rule-based approach).
*   **Enhance Rule Inference with Contextual Information:** Provide the LLM with more contextual information during rule inference. This could include explicitly stating the relationships between elements in the grid (e.g., "element A is above element B") or providing additional training examples that highlight different aspects of the transformation rule.

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

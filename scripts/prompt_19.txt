            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

The problem is decomposed into transforming the grid and validating the output format. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates the process, calling `transform_test_grid` to generate the transformed grid and `validate_grid_format` to verify the output. `transform_test_grid` uses a multi-example prompt to guide the LLM to apply transformations observed in the training data. `validate_grid_format` uses the LLM to confirm that the output is a list of lists containing only integers.

Two agents are implicitly defined via system instructions: a visual feature analyzer and a transformation applier.

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Explicitly Separate Transformation Logic:** In the prompting strategy, explicitly request a description of the transformation rule *before* asking for code. This may force the system to reason about the logic before trying to implement it.",
  "Implement a More Sophisticated Pattern Learning Algorithm:** Explore more advanced machine learning models or algorithms that are specifically designed for pattern recognition and generalization tasks.",
  "Refine the prompt**: Add \"after you have generated the code please then execute the code and produce the final grid\"",
  "Augment Training Data:** Increase the diversity and complexity of the training examples to improve pattern recognition and generalization. Include examples with variations in the grid size, element values, and transformation rules.",
  "Add Constraints and Verification Steps:** Implement constraint handling and solution verification steps to ensure that the generated transformations adhere to specific rules and constraints.",
  "Ensure code execution and output:** The final step should be to always execute the generated code and present the result.",
  "Implement a more robust pattern recognition algorithm:** Explore techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or other image processing methods to identify patterns in the grid transformations.",
  "Introduce more explicit constraint handling in the code generation process:** Ensure that the code generated adheres to the constraints observed in the training examples. This could involve incorporating constraint checking mechanisms within the generated code.",
  "Add tracing/debugging statements in the generated code**: Insert print statements showing the grid at various intermediate points to track the logic.",
  "Introduce Visualisation:** Use visualisations to show the differences between the predicted output grid and the target grid. The model can then adapt the transformations based on this information."

    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).

    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.

    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")

        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 18 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script employs a multi-agent iterative refinement approach to solve grid transformation problems. It decomposes the problem into three main stages: rule extraction, rule refinement with reverse transformation checks, and rule application, each handled by a specialized agent. The agents are implemented via specifically-prompted LLM calls. Key functions include `solve_grid_transformation`, which orchestrates the process; `extract_transformation_rule`, which extracts the initial rule; `refine_transformation_rule`, which iteratively refines the rule and introduces a "reverse transformation" step to validate the transformations; `apply_transformation`, which applies the refined rule to generate the final output; and `call_llm`, a general-purpose function for interacting with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves extracting an initial transformation rule from the input examples, iteratively refining this rule while validating that it can be reversed, and then applying the final refined rule to the test input grid to produce the transformed grid.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 17 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script solves grid transformation problems by having an LLM generate a natural language transformation script and then follow that script to produce the transformed grid. The problem is decomposed into generating the script and following it, using `generate_transformation_script` and `follow_transformation_script` respectively. The LLM acts as an expert in generating transformation scripts and then as an expert in following them. `call_llm` is used to interface with the Gemini model.

The overall workflow involves: `solve_grid_transformation` which calls `generate_transformation_script` to get a script, verifies it within the function, and then calls `follow_transformation_script` to apply the script. `call_llm` is utilized by both `generate_transformation_script` and `follow_transformation_script` to interact with the LLM.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 16 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script solves grid transformation problems using an LLM with a chain-of-thought approach, first analyzing visual features and then applying a transformation. It decomposes the problem into feature analysis and transformation application, employing the `analyze_visual_features` function to describe the transformation rule and the `apply_transformation` function to generate the output grid based on that rule. The agent roles are "expert at analyzing visual features" and "expert at applying transformations".  The `call_llm` function is used to interface with the Gemini model. The overall workflow involves `solve_grid_transformation` calling `analyze_visual_features` to get a transformation description, validating the description, and then calling `apply_transformation` to get the final grid, using `call_llm` for all LLM interactions.

Approach: The script uses the Gemini LLM to solve grid transformation problems by learning from examples and directly generating the output grid. The problem is decomposed into transforming the test grid and validating the output format. The LLM acts as a grid transformer and a grid validator, guided by system instructions and prompts. The `call_llm` function is used to interact with the Gemini API, `transform_test_grid` transforms the grid based on training examples, and `validate_grid_format` validates if the output is a list of lists containing only numbers. The overall workflow involves transforming the grid using the LLM, validating the format of the transformed grid using the LLM, and returning the transformed grid if valid.

            LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, I've synthesized the existing knowledge with the new learnings from Iteration 18, focusing on the Grid Transformation Task dataset. This log emphasizes concrete, task-specific insights to guide future experiments and prevent repeating past errors, while staying within the token limits.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   **Question Format:** Tasks are presented as "Grid Transformation Tasks" with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" (input/output grid pairs) and a "TEST INPUT" grid. The objective is to generate the "OUTPUT GRID" for the test input, following patterns from the training examples.
*   **Consistent Structure:** Questions follow a consistent structure: a "Grid Transformation Task" header, "TRAINING EXAMPLES" with Input/Output grid pairs, a "TEST INPUT" grid, and an instruction to transform the test input.
*   **Grid Representation:** Grids are represented as nested lists of integers (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`). Grid dimensions (rows and columns) vary between examples and even within a single example (input vs. output). Grids are typically small matrices of integers, often with a background value (e.g., 0) and a few other distinct values that participate in the transformation rules. Input and Output grid have consistent dimensions within a question.
*   **Mixed Element Types:** Grids often contain a mix of elements, including zeros and other numerical values.
*   **Training Examples followed by Test Input:** Each problem is structured with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" showing input-output pairs, followed by a "TEST INPUT" for which the transformed grid must be generated.
*   **Transformation Logic:** The core challenge is identifying the transformation logic. This logic can involve:
    *   Expansion, substitution, mirroring, replication of rows/columns, shifting values, replacing values based on surrounding cells, and combinations of these.
    *   Spatial relationships between numbers (e.g., a cell's value depends on its neighbors). The rules are often *localized* to the vicinity of a cell, or, conversely, depend on characteristics of a subgrid. Spatial reasoning is often required.
    *   Numerical transformations (e.g., adding a constant to each cell).
    *   Combinations of spatial and numerical transformations. The transformations can be complex and context-dependent, applying differently based on the location or the neighboring elements of an element.
    *   Transformations can involve replacing elements with new values based on their original value and location, and introducing new non-zero values to previously zeroed cells.
    *   Transformations often involve changing specific numbers within the grid based on their position or surrounding numbers. Patterns can include adding/removing a number from a specific location.
    *   Dimensionality changes are common between input and output grids, implying the system must infer resizing or cropping operations. The size of the grid is not consistent across different examples, or even within examples in a question, posing a challenge.
    *   Transformations often involve identifying specific numbers or patterns within the grid and then applying a change based on their location or relationship to other elements. The complexity lies in discerning the exact transformation rule from a limited number of examples.
    *   A key characteristic is the presence of patterns relating the input and output grids, which involve moving, shifting, or transforming numbers within the grid.
    *   Grid reduction and value extraction are also possible transformations. Transformations can even collapse a large grid to a single element.
    *   The model struggles to apply multiple transformation rules within a single grid. For example, identifying both row and column-based shifts in conjunction with value changes proves too complex.
    *   The models seem to struggle with patterns that are based on *where* something is relative to something else. I.e., "change all 1s that are next to a 2 to a 3".
    *   Transformations often involve replicating and/or propagating numbers from certain locations to fill empty spaces.
    *   Some questions may include "filler" numbers; some grids can contain numbers that do not get transferred and instead get overwritten.
*   **Implicit Rules:** Transformation logic is *never* explicitly stated. The LLM must infer the rules from limited training examples.
*   **Abstract Rules:** The underlying transformation rules are abstract and not immediately obvious. They can involve changes to specific numbers, their locations relative to other numbers, or based on other complex patterns in the grid.
*   **Few-Shot Learning Format:** Questions are presented in a few-shot format.
*   **Varying Grid Sizes:** Transformations might be size-dependent. The dimensions of the grids vary significantly across different questions (e.g., 5x11, 18x18, 10x10), requiring the model to generalize across different grid sizes.
*   **Multiple Possible Rules:** Different transformations might yield similar results on the training data but diverge on the test data.
*   **Value Dependencies:** A cell's new value may depend on multiple other cells.
*   **Asymmetric Transformations:** The transformation might not be symmetrical across the grid.
*   **Value Encoding:** Specific values within the grids (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9) have semantic meaning related to the transformation.
*   **Element Distribution:** The approach fails when faced with new input grids that have different element distributions compared to the training examples.
*   **Small integer matrices:** The grids are typically small matrices of integers, often with a background value (e.g., 0) and a few other distinct values that participate in the transformation rules.
*   **Limited Training Examples:** The number of training examples provided is often limited (typically 1-3), making robust pattern recognition and generalization challenging.
*    **"5" as a Separator/Constant:** The number "5" appears to act as a visual separator in the grids, forming a consistent boundary or structural element that remains unchanged during the transformation.
*   **Pattern Extrapolation:** The underlying task demands extrapolating a relatively abstract visual pattern from a very small number of examples (often just 3-4). The relationships between corresponding cells across input and output grids need to be understood and then applied.

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   **None consistently effective:** Given the consistently low accuracy, no single strategy has emerged as reliably effective for this dataset.
*   **LLM-based Visual Feature Analysis (Potentially Useful):** Using an LLM to analyze the visual features and infer transformation rules is a promising approach, but generalization remains a major challenge. The attempt to decompose the problem into visual feature analysis and transformation application is a potentially sound strategy, *if* the model can accurately perform the feature analysis.
*   **Two-Step LLM Approach (Potentially Useful):** The two-step LLM approach (analyze then apply) shows some promise, but is still insufficient for reliable generalization.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Specialized Agents (Inconsistent):** The chain-of-thought approach, with specialized expert agents for visual feature analysis and transformation application, shows promise but suffers from inconsistent performance due to the LLM's issues with generalization.
*   **Decomposition (Helpful):** Breaking down the problem into analyzing visual features and applying the transformation simplifies the task.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Multi-Example Prompts (Helpful):** Chain-of-thought prompting with multi-example prompts has been helpful in guiding the LLM to recognize patterns, but improvements are needed.
*   **Analogical Reasoning (Potentially Useful):** The analogical reasoning approach demonstrates potential in pattern recognition, but has not achieved high accuracy.
*   **Proper API Configuration (Critical):** API configuration is paramount for any LLM-based strategy to function. The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable must be correctly set, and the chosen LLM model (e.g., 'gemini-pro') must be accessible.

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **LLM Access Failure:** The system's inability to access the designated LLM (e.g., 'gemini-pro'), leading to a complete failure to generate any output. This can be due to incorrect API key configuration, unavailability of the model, or network connectivity issues. *Example: Iteration 12.*
*   **API Key Configuration Issues:** Incorrectly setting or failing to retrieve the API key from the environment (e.g., the environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) prevents the system from accessing the LLM. *Example: Iteration 12.*
*   **Empty Output Grid:** Frequently returns an empty list `[[]]`, indicating a breakdown in grid manipulation or output formatting.
*   **Inability to Generate Valid Output:** The system fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training examples and apply them to the test input.
*   **Complex Reasoning:** The system struggles with questions that require complex reasoning about spatial relationships or value dependencies within the grid.
*   **Over-Reliance on Memorization:** The LLM seems to memorize training examples rather than generalizing the transformation logic.
*   **Inability to Abstract Complex Rules:** The dataset requires the abstraction of non-linear relationships and contextual dependencies within the grid.
*   **Inaccurate Pattern Generalization:** The primary failure lies in the LLM's inability to generalize the transformation rule from the training examples to the test input. The LLM demonstrates *poor generalization* from the training examples, failing to extrapolate transformation rules when the test input differs even slightly from the training set.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Generalization:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation patterns from the training examples.
*   **Pattern Misinterpretation:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation logic from the training examples.
*   **Inability to abstract general rules:** The model fails to generalize from the limited examples to novel test inputs.
*   **Incorrect Application:** Even when the LLM correctly identifies the transformation, it struggles to apply it to the test input. This can involve errors in indexing, calculations, or general logic.
*   **Lack of Spatial Precision:** LLMs sometimes struggle with precise spatial relationships within the grid. The system struggles to place transformed elements in the correct positions within the output grid, suggesting a weakness in understanding and applying the spatial logic of the transformation.
*   **Dimensionality Mismatch:** The LLM generates output grids with incorrect dimensions compared to the expected output grid. *Example: Iteration 0, Example 2; Iteration 5, Example 1.*
*   **Shape and Dimensionality Errors:** The generated output grids often have incorrect shapes or dimensions compared to the expected output.
*   **Output Format Mismatch:** The generated output grid does not match the size or shape expected by the golden answer, even if the values have some correctness.
*   **Incorrect Value Mapping:** Even when the dimensions are correct, the LLM fails to map values correctly. The numerical relationships between corresponding cells in the input and output grids are not accurately learned and applied. *Example: Iteration 0, Example 3; Iteration 5, Examples 2 and 3.*
*   **Incorrect Element Replacement:** The system might be identifying the correct structure, but using the wrong numbers.
*   **Value Errors:** The system generates grids containing numbers not present in the target grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** The LLM outputs the response as a string containing Python code that *would* define the output grid, rather than directly outputting the grid.
*   **Ambiguity:** The transformations are implicit and can be interpreted in multiple ways from just a few examples.
*   **Complexity:** The underlying transformations might be complex involving combinations of replication, shifting, value changes, and so on.
*   **Inability to Extract Accurate Transformation Rules:** The system consistently fails to extract accurate and generalizable transformation rules from the training examples.
*   **Fragility of Pattern Recognition:** The system's pattern recognition approach is fragile and easily disrupted by small variations in the input grids.
*   **Lack of Rule Validation:** The system's rule validation process is not robust enough to catch inaccurate or incomplete rules. The assumption that better validation loops will lead to higher generalization was not demonstrated in these experiments.
*   **Localized Contextual Analysis Insufficient:** The LLM struggles to generalize even seemingly simple local rules across the entire grid.
*   **Oversimplification of Transformations:** The LLM tends to oversimplify the transformation rules, leading to incorrect outputs.
*   **Complex Rule Interpretation:** The system struggles when the transformation involves multiple intertwined rules.
*   **Incomplete Generalization:** The model fails to accurately generalize rules based on limited examples.
*   **In-place vs. New Object Confusion:** The model is getting confused with modifying the input grid vs. creating a new output grid.
*   **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** In cases where the transformation involves mirroring, the implemented logic is sometimes flawed, leading to incorrect placements of mirrored elements or unintended modifications.
*   **Positional Transformation Neglect:** The system is unable to accurately capture how the grid modifies elements and their positions to produce the result.
*   **Difficulty with complex value dependencies:** The model struggles when the transformation relies on complex combinations or relationships between different values in the grid.
*   **Misinterpretation of spatial relationships:** The model incorrectly interprets how objects and values in the grid are spatially related and how these relationships change during the transformation.
*   **Misinterpretation of Visual Features:** The `analyze_visual_features` step is prone to misinterpreting the key visual features of the grid.
*   **Inconsistent Transformation Application:** The primary failure mode is the inconsistent application of identified transformation rules to the test input.
*   **Ambiguous Transformations:** Some training examples might have multiple possible interpretations, leading the LLM to learn an incorrect or incomplete transformation.
*   **Error in output format**: The model can reason correctly about the grid transformation, but then output a grid of the incorrect size, or even the correct size but as text rather than code.
*   **Dimensionality and Element Distribution:** The approach fails when faced with new input grids that have different dimensions or element distributions compared to the training examples.
*   **Error in Transformation:** The LLM sometimes produces an error rather than a valid transformation.
*   **Overfitting to Superficial Patterns:** The system tends to overfit to simple patterns in the training examples (Iteration 13).
*   **Inability to Generalize Complex Rules:** The system struggles with complex transformation rules that involve relationships between different elements or regions of the grid (Iteration 13). The transformation logic often requires spatial reasoning which the LLM fails to capture (Iteration 13).
*   **Output validation inadequate:** Relying on an LLM for output validation may be flawed.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Identification:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the transformation pattern from the limited training examples.
*   **Inability to Handle Number Transformations:** The LLM struggles with generalizing the transformation of numbers within the grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** Even when the LLM identifies a possible pattern, the generated code often contains logical errors or fails to translate the pattern into correct grid manipulation.
*   **Incorrect number propagation:** The model frequently fails to correctly identify *which* numbers from the input grid need to be propagated and replicated in the output grid. It often defaults to '5' as a fill value when it should be something else (e.g., copying '4' and '8' in the first failure example).
*   **Ignoring Existing Grid Values:** The model struggles with transformations that require *both* copying values *and* introducing a fill value.
*   **Context-Switching Errors:** The model struggles to perform different transformations in the same grid at once.

**4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS**

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Direct pattern matching would be more effective than explicit rule extraction.
    *   **Approach:** "Ensemble" approach - generate multiple plausible grids and select the best.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis is rejected.
*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Explicitly prompting the LLM to extract and validate transformation rules will improve performance.
    *   **Approach:** Prompt the LLM to extract a transformation rule, then validate it, then apply it.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** Explicit rule extraction alone is insufficient. Validation alone isn't sufficient to overcome issues in rule extraction.
*   **Iteration 2:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Localized contextual analysis of the grid transformations will improve the accuracy.
    *   **Approach:** Prompt the LLM to analyze the training examples by focusing on the immediate context (neighbors) of each cell in the grid. The LLM will then generate a transformation rule based on these localized relationships and apply it to the test input.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that focusing on localized contextual analysis would be sufficient is **rejected**.
*   **Iteration 3:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Breaking down the grid transformation into individual element transformations is a sufficient approach.
    *   **Approach:** Adapt `analyze_elements` to transform each element separately based on the other training input/output pairs.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The experiment rejects the hypothesis that breaking down the grid transformation into individual element transformations is a sufficient approach.
*   **Iteration 4:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Extracting and applying rules with validation will improve performance.
    *   **Approach:** Use implicit agent roles for rule extraction and grid transformation.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00
    *   **Finding:** The "extraction and application with validation" strategy failed to achieve any accuracy.
*   **Iteration 5:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Decomposing the problem into row and column analysis would simplify pattern recognition.
    *   **Approach:** Independently analyze rows and columns, combined with LLM-based transformation.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that decomposing the problem into row and column analysis would simplify the pattern recognition was rejected.
*   **Iteration 6:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Hierarchical decomposition would improve performance by first identifying the overall transformation type, then extracting specific parameters, and finally applying the transformation.
    *   **Approach:** Use hierarchical decomposition: (1) Identify Transformation Type (2) Extract Transformation Parameters (3) Apply the transformation
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00
    *   **Finding:** The attempt to improve grid transformation problems using the LLM by identifying the overall transformation type, then extracting specific parameters, and finally applying the transformation alone did not solve the underlying inability to generalize from training examples.
*   **Iteration 7:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Describing transformations in terms of visual features will improve generalization.
    *   **Approach:** Use chain-of-thought with specialized expert agents for visual feature analysis and transformation application.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.33.
    *   **Finding:** The core hypothesis of describing transformations in terms of visual features to improve generalization is only partially supported.
*   **Iteration 8:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Analogical reasoning can be used to identify and apply grid transformations.
    *   **Approach:** Decompose the problem and use the LLM to identify similarities between training examples and test inputs, then apply identified transformations.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis of using analogical reasoning via multiple LLM calls was not validated.
*   **Iteration 9:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Attempting to directly transform the grid based on LLM's implicit learning from multi-example prompts would work.
    *   **Approach:** Multi-example prompting and direct transformation without explicit rule definition.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** Relying solely on the LLM's ability to directly transform the grid based on multi-example prompts, without explicitly defining transformation rules, is insufficient for this task.
*   **Iteration 10:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Multi-example prompting in a two-step (analyze, then apply) LLM approach will improve performance by guiding pattern recognition.
    *   **Approach:** Use a two-step LLM approach: first analyze the training examples with multi-example prompts, then apply the derived transformation rule to the test input.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.33.
    *   **Finding:** The multi-example prompting improves performance compared to single-example prompting in the two-step LLM approach, but is still insufficient for reliable generalization.
*   **Iteration 11:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Exploiting the current best approach (Iteration 10) will yield significant improvements.
    *   **Approach:** Focus on refining the prompting strategy and validation techniques from Iteration 10.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.33.
    *   **Finding:** Relying solely on exploitation of the current approach did not yield significant improvement. The accuracy remained low, indicating that the core issues with pattern recognition and generalization were not addressed.
*   **Iteration 12:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** A chain-of-thought approach can solve grid transformation problems.
    *   **Approach:** Implement a chain-of-thought reasoning process to guide the LLM in analyzing the training examples and applying the transformation rule to the test input.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis was immediately rejected due to the system's inability to access the LLM. Proper API configuration is paramount.
*   **Iteration 13:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Adding more detailed examples and implementing a validation loop will improve the visual feature analysis and transformation application.
    *   **Approach:** The exploitation strategy was used, which focused on analyzing visual features and then applying a transformation using chain-of-thought prompting.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis was rejected. The strategy failed to achieve any accuracy on the dataset.
*   **Iteration 14:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** The LLM can directly generate the output grid by learning a transformation function represented implicitly in the examples.
    *   **Approach:** Direct generation of output grid using LLM's pattern recognition capabilities.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis was rejected. The LLM's few-shot learning abilities are insufficient for this task, at least with the current prompting strategy. The LLM demonstrates some pattern recognition capabilities, but it cannot generalize to unseen grid configurations. Relies on memorization.
*   **Iteration 15:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Adding multi-example prompting and implementing explicit output checks would improve generalization.
    *   **Approach:** The "Exploitation" strategy, focused on analyzing visual features and then applying a transformation using chain-of-thought prompting. Explicit checks for output grid dimensions and value ranges.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis was rejected. The current implementation appears unable to learn from multiple examples or enforce basic output constraints. The primary failure mode is the inability to generate a valid output grid, often returning an empty list (`[[]]`).
*   **Iteration 16:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Better validation loops will lead to higher generalization.
    *   **Approach:** Focus on the exploitation strategy and refining the visual feature analysis and transformation application.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** Iteration 16 makes it clear that focusing solely on exploitation of previous "best" approaches is insufficient. The fundamental limitation lies in the model's core understanding and generalization of the patterns. The assumption that better validation loops will lead to higher generalization was not demonstrated in these experiments.
*   **Iteration 17:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** The LLM can generate and follow a natural language transformation script effectively.
    *   **Approach:** Generate a script, and then generate code to follow it.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy: 0.33
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that the LLM could generate and follow a natural language transformation script effectively was largely rejected. While the LLM can generate scripts, it lacks the accuracy in pattern recognition and coding ability to solve these problems reliably. Script following is bottlenecked by the LLM's ability to create correct and representative scripts.
*   **Iteration 18:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** A multi-agent iterative refinement strategy can improve the LLM's ability to generalize grid transformation patterns.
    *   **Approach:** Iterative refinement with specialized agents and "reverse transformation check."
    *   **Result:** Accuracy: 0.00
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis was rejected. The reverse transformation check did not improve accuracy.

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

*   **Focus on Debugging and Correctness:** Prioritize debugging the core logic responsible for grid manipulation and output generation.

*   **Code Generation Fine-Tuning:** Encourage the LLM to generate a *validated* code implementation of the transformation rules. Add instructions to test the code by running the training examples, and fix it if the output is incorrect.
*   **Explicit Spatial Reasoning:** If spatial relationships are involved, provide the LLM with explicit spatial reasoning tools, such as functions to calculate distances, identify neighbors, or perform rotations/reflections on grid elements.
*   **Improved Output Validation:** Implement a more robust validation function that can evaluate the *logic* of the transformation in the output grid, rather than just its format.
*   **Introduce Explicit Rule Extraction:** Focus on methods that first extract explicit transformation rules from the training examples and then apply those rules to the test input.
*   **Decompose the Transformation Process:** Decompose the transformation process into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, identifying specific regions or elements to transform, determining the transformation operation, and applying the operation.

        *   Generating synthetic grid transformation examples based on known transformation rules.
        *   Creating variations of existing examples by applying small perturbations or noise.
*   **Explore Hybrid Approaches:** Investigate hybrid approaches that combine the LLM's reasoning abilities with more traditional algorithms for pattern recognition and grid manipulation. The LLM could be used to guide the algorithm or to validate the results.

*   **Implement a Dimension Inference Module:** Develop a module that explicitly infers the dimensions of the output grid based on the training examples before attempting value transformations.
*   **Train for positional reasoning**: It's not enough to know what values to change. The system must reason about *where* to change them.
*   **Rethink the LLM Agent Roles:** Re-evaluate the roles of the LLM agents.
*   **Incorporate Validation Steps:** Add validation steps to ensure the generated output grid adheres to patterns observed in the training examples, such as value distributions and dimension ratios.

*   **Add unit tests:** Add unit tests for `transform_grid` function.
*   **Enhanced Rule Extraction:** Refine the `extract_transformation_rule` agent to focus explicitly on identifying the source locations of numbers to be replicated. Implement a mechanism to distinguish between "source" values and "filler" values.
*   **Value-Specific Propagation:** Modify the `refine_transformation_rule` and `apply_transformation` agents to ensure that the correct values are being propagated based on their source locations. Get rid of '5' fill value issue.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** Test a combination of explicit rule-based transformations (hard-coded logic for common patterns) with the LLM-based agents.
*   **Context Aware Prompting:** Change the prompting strategy to explicitly instruct agents to be aware of the grid context during transformations. For example, ask the agent to recognize if a certain transformation changes pre-existing values, or introduces new "filler" values.

            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset

            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator

               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
            

            Here are example problems from previously seen data:

The agents are implemented via specifically-prompted LLM calls. Key functions include `solve_grid_transformation`, which orchestrates the process; `extract_transformation_rule`, which extracts the initial rule; `refine_transformation_rule`, which iteratively refines the rule and introduces a \"reverse transformation\" step to validate the transformations; `apply_transformation`, which applies the refined rule to generate the final output; and `call_llm`, a general-purpose function for interacting with the Gemini LLM.

It uses a chain-of-thought approach by first asking the LLM whether to subdivide the grid based on the problem, and then transforming the (sub)grid. Two agent roles are involved: one for deciding on subdivision and another for transforming the grid. The functions used are `solve_grid_transformation` which initiates the process, `subdivide_and_transform` which recursively subdivides and transforms, `transform_subgrid` which transforms a single subgrid using the LLM, and `call_llm` which interacts with the LLM. The overall workflow is: the main function calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which calls `subdivide_and_transform` recursively; if subdivision is needed, the grid is divided and `subdivide_and_transform` is called on the subgrids. Otherwise, `transform_subgrid` is called to transform the grid directly, and the `call_llm` function sends a prompt to the LLM which makes the final transformation decision."

    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's **failure to develop a robust and generalizable understanding of the grid transformation logic.** The current approach seems to rely on memorizing specific patterns from the training examples rather than learning underlying rules and constraints. The pattern matching is too fragile and does not handle variations in input grid configurations effectively."

  {
    "iteration": 15,
    "issue": "The single most critical problem is the inability to consistently generate a correctly formatted output grid based on the learned pattern from the training examples. This could stem from incorrect manipulation of the grid data structure, an error in the output serialization logic, or a combination of both. Debugging should focus on the code responsible for generating the final grid representation."

    "iteration": 16,
    "issue": "The single most critical problem is the system's **failure to learn and generalize the underlying transformation logic** from the training examples.

    "issue": "The most critical problem is the **inaccurate transformation logic** in the `grid transformation` functionality. The logic for filling the gaps between values is incorrectly using the number '5' even when it is clear the correct values should be other numbers."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 19,
    "issue": "The single most critical problem is **the lack of null-checking or proper initialization before numerical comparisons within the core grid transformation algorithm**.

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:

  "Ensure code execution and output:** The final step should be to always execute the generated code and present the result.",
  "Implement a mechanism to ensure that the generated output grid has the same dimensions as the output grids in the training examples.",

  "Develop heuristics or learned metrics to assess the \"quality\" or \"consistency\" of the generated solution.",
  "If the verification step identifies inconsistencies, explore techniques such as iterative refinement or re-generation of the solution.",
  "Add tracing/debugging statements in the generated code**: Insert print statements showing the grid at various intermediate points to track the logic.",
  "Implement a more explicit representation of the identified pattern, such as a symbolic description of the transformation rules. This representation can then be used to guide the transformation of the test input.",
  "Introduce more explicit constraint handling in the code generation process:** Ensure that the code generated adheres to the constraints observed in the training examples. This could involve incorporating constraint checking mechanisms within the generated code.",
  "Refine the prompt**: Add \"after you have generated the code please then execute the code and produce the final grid\"",

    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)

        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])

                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 23 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script solves grid transformation problems by first analyzing visual features using an LLM and then applying the described transformation. The problem is decomposed into `analyze_visual_features` (identifies the transformation) and `apply_transformation` (applies the transformation to a test grid). The agent roles include an expert at analyzing visual features and an expert at applying transformations. Other functions used include `call_llm` to interface with the Gemini API and `main` to orchestrate the overall process.

The workflow is as follows: `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which calls `analyze_visual_features` to get a transformation description (verified by the LLM), and then calls `apply_transformation` to generate the final output grid. `call_llm` is used by both `analyze_visual_features` and `apply_transformation` to interact with the Gemini model.

Approach: The script uses an LLM to solve grid transformation problems by decomposing the problem into identifying regions and rules, and then applying transformations based on those rules. Two agent roles are implicitly used: one for identifying regions and rules, and another for applying transformations. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates the process, calling `identify_regions_and_rules` to get the regions and rules, and then `apply_transformation` to transform the grid. `call_llm` is used to communicate with the Gemini LLM, taking a prompt and system instruction, and returning the LLM's response.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 19 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script solves grid transformation problems by recursively subdividing the grid and applying LLM-based transformations to each subgrid. It uses a chain-of-thought approach by first asking the LLM whether to subdivide the grid based on the problem, and then transforming the (sub)grid. Two agent roles are involved: one for deciding on subdivision and another for transforming the grid. The functions used are `solve_grid_transformation` which initiates the process, `subdivide_and_transform` which recursively subdivides and transforms, `transform_subgrid` which transforms a single subgrid using the LLM, and `call_llm` which interacts with the LLM. The overall workflow is: the main function calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which calls `subdivide_and_transform` recursively; if subdivision is needed, the grid is divided and `subdivide_and_transform` is called on the subgrids. Otherwise, `transform_subgrid` is called to transform the grid directly, and the `call_llm` function sends a prompt to the LLM which makes the final transformation decision.

```python
import os
import re
import math

# EXPLORATION: LLM-Orchestrated Recursive Subdivision and Transformation
# HYPOTHESIS: By having the LLM recursively subdivide the grid into smaller regions,
# identify transformation rules for those subregions independently, and then
# stitch the transformed subregions back together, we can handle more complex
# transformations that apply differently to different parts of the grid. This leverages
# the LLM's ability to identify and apply patterns locally, while also maintaining
# a global understanding of the overall grid structure. This approach directly addresses
# the past weaknesses of failing to handle different transformations in the same grid or to perform transformations depending on location.

            LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, I've synthesized the existing knowledge with the new learnings from Iteration 23, ensuring all existing information is preserved and the focus remains on concrete, task-specific insights for the Grid Transformation Task dataset.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   **Question Format:** Tasks are presented as "Grid Transformation Tasks" with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" (input/output grid pairs) and a "TEST INPUT" grid. The objective is to generate the "OUTPUT GRID" for the test input, following patterns from the training examples.
*   **Consistent Structure:** Questions follow a consistent structure: a "Grid Transformation Task" header, "TRAINING EXAMPLES" with Input/Output grid pairs, a "TEST INPUT" grid, and an instruction to transform the test input.
*   **Grid Representation:** Grids are represented as nested lists of integers (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`). Grid dimensions (rows and columns) vary. Grids are typically small matrices of integers, often with a background value (e.g., 0) and a few other distinct values that participate in the transformation rules. Input and Output grid have consistent dimensions within a question. Grids are typically 10x10 or 17x17.
*   **Mixed Element Types:** Grids often contain a mix of elements, including zeros and other numerical values. There appear to be 'border' values, and 'inner' values that are subject to transformation.
*   **Training Examples followed by Test Input:** Each problem is structured with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" showing input-output pairs, followed by a "TEST INPUT" for which the transformed grid must be generated.
*   **Abstracted Transformations:** The transformations are not explicitly described but must be inferred from the input-output pairs in the training examples. This requires the model to identify both content-based and spatial patterns. A common structure is to maintain most of the grid the same, while transforming certain numbers into other numbers based on their spatial relationships.
*   **Transformation Logic:** The core challenge is identifying the transformation logic. This logic can involve:
    *   Expansion, substitution, mirroring, replication of rows/columns, shifting values, replacing values based on surrounding cells, and combinations of these. Transformations are consistent within each training example pair, but not across training example pairs.
    *   Spatial relationships between numbers (e.g., a cell's value depends on its neighbors). The rules are often *localized* to the vicinity of a cell, or, conversely, depend on characteristics of a subgrid. Spatial reasoning is often required. New elements can be placed at new locations based on the spatial relationships of other numbers in the grid. The system struggles with patterns that are based on *where* something is relative to something else (e.g., "change all 1s that are next to a 2 to a 3"). The underlying task demands extrapolating a relatively abstract visual pattern from a very small number of examples.
    *   Numerical transformations (e.g., adding a constant to each cell). It appears the system tends to memorize specific number-to-number transformations seen in training, rather than extracting the underlying logic. For example, in one case (Iteration 22), the model incorrectly maps a '1' to a '5' instead of the other way around.
    *   Combinations of spatial and numerical transformations. The transformations can be complex and context-dependent, applying differently based on the location or the neighboring elements of an element.
    *   Transformations can involve replacing elements with new values based on their original value and location, and introducing new non-zero values to previously zeroed cells.
    *   Transformations often involve identifying specific numbers or patterns within the grid and then applying a change based on their location or relationship to other elements.
    *   A key characteristic is the presence of patterns relating the input and output grids, which involve moving, shifting, or transforming numbers within the grid.
    *   Grid reduction and value extraction are also possible transformations. Transformations can even collapse a large grid to a single element.
    *   The model struggles to apply multiple transformation rules within a single grid.
    *   Transformations often involve replicating and/or propagating numbers from certain locations to fill empty spaces. The model frequently fails to correctly identify *which* numbers from the input grid need to be propagated and replicated in the output grid.
    *   Some questions may include "filler" numbers; some grids can contain numbers that do not get transferred and instead get overwritten.
    *   Many elements in the input grid map to zero in the output grid, suggesting that the relevant transformation is often localized or involves significant data reduction.
*   **Implicit Rules:** Transformation logic is *never* explicitly stated. The LLM must infer the rules from limited training examples.
*   **Abstract Rules:** The underlying transformation rules are abstract and not immediately obvious.
*   **Few-Shot Learning Format:** Questions are presented in a few-shot format.
*   **Varying Grid Sizes:** Transformations might be size-dependent.
*   **Multiple Possible Rules:** Different transformations might yield similar results on the training data but diverge on the test data.
*   **Value Dependencies:** A cell's new value may depend on multiple other cells.
*   **Asymmetric Transformations:** The transformation might not be symmetrical across the grid.
*   **Value Encoding:** Specific values within the grids (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9) have semantic meaning related to the transformation.
*   **Element Distribution:** The approach fails when faced with new input grids that have different element distributions compared to the training examples.
*   **Limited Training Examples:** The number of training examples provided is often limited (typically 1-3), making robust pattern recognition and generalization challenging.
*   **"5" as a Separator/Constant:** The number "5" appears to act as a visual separator in the grids, forming a consistent boundary or structural element that remains unchanged during the transformation.
*   **Zero Prevalence:** Many grids contain a significant number of zeros, particularly in the training examples. Non-zero values often represent distinct visual elements or patterns, and the transformations involve replicating, shifting, or altering these elements.

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   **None consistently effective:** Given the consistently low accuracy, no single strategy has emerged as reliably effective for this dataset (Iteration 22: Accuracy 0.33, Iteration 23: Accuracy 0.00).
*   **LLM-based Visual Feature Analysis (Potentially Useful):** Using an LLM to analyze the visual features and infer transformation rules is a promising approach, but generalization remains a major challenge. The attempt to decompose the problem into visual feature analysis and transformation application is a potentially sound strategy, *if* the model can accurately perform the feature analysis.
*   **Two-Step LLM Approach (Potentially Useful):** The two-step LLM approach (analyze then apply) shows some promise, but is still insufficient for reliable generalization.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Specialized Agents (Inconsistent):** The chain-of-thought approach, with specialized expert agents for visual feature analysis and transformation application, shows promise but suffers from inconsistent performance due to the LLM's issues with generalization.
*   **Decomposition (Helpful):** Breaking down the problem into analyzing visual features and applying the transformation simplifies the task.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Multi-Example Prompts (Helpful):** Chain-of-thought prompting with multi-example prompts has been helpful in guiding the LLM to recognize patterns, but improvements are needed.
*   **Analogical Reasoning (Potentially Useful):** The analogical reasoning approach demonstrates potential in pattern recognition, but has not achieved high accuracy.
*   **Proper API Configuration (Critical):** API configuration is paramount for any LLM-based strategy to function. The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable must be correctly set, and the chosen LLM model (e.g., 'gemini-pro') must be accessible.
*   **LLM-guided recursive subdivision (Potentially Useful):** If transformations are locally consistent, then LLM-guided recursive subdivision *might* have potential.
*   **Coordinate-based transformation rules generated from an LLM (Potentially Useful):** At a basic level the LLM is able to correctly identify locations of numbers.

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **Incorrect Output Format:** The system consistently fails to produce a nested list (list of lists) as required, instead returning an error message or other non-grid output. This is a fundamental flaw in the `apply_transformation` function or in data coercion preventing the creation of the correct data structure. *Example: Iteration 23.*
*   **Incorrect Content Transformation:** The model struggles to accurately identify and apply the correct number transformations. For example, in one case (Iteration 22), it incorrectly maps a '1' to a '5' instead of the other way around.
*   **Pattern Generalization Failure:** The core failure is the inability to generalize transformation rules from training examples to the test input. Even slight variations between the training set and the test input can cause failure. The LLM demonstrates *poor generalization* failing to extrapolate transformation rules. In the first error example of Iteration 21, the LLM fails to correctly transfer the pattern of moving numbers from one area of the grid to another, and transforming them as they move.
*   **Numerical Mapping Errors:** The system fails to consistently map numbers correctly. It appears to memorize specific number-to-number transformations seen in training, but doesn't extract the underlying logic. In Iteration 21, the first failure example, the golden answer has 3s and 4s while the actual answer contains 7s and 3s, suggesting direct numerical substitutions (e.g., "8 becomes 7"), but not how or where to apply them in the grid.
*   **Spatial Configuration Misinterpretation:** The system struggles to discern the spatial aspects of the transformations. It may identify regions, but fails to understand how elements within those regions should be rearranged or replicated to produce the correct output. In the second error example of Iteration 21, the LLM fails to correctly copy a pattern of 5's from one location to another, demonstrating a failure to understand the *spatial* aspect of the transformation.
*   **Output Grid Dimension Errors:** The model often generates output grids with incorrect dimensions, either in terms of row or column count (Iteration 22). It cannot match the grid size with the expected output, even when dimensions are explicitly shown in training examples.
*   **Null Value Handling:** The script encounters `None` values during numerical comparisons. This likely happens when the LLM returns unexpected output or when the input grid has unexpected values that the code doesn't handle, leading to the assignment of `None` to a variable that is then used in a numerical comparison.
*   **Unexpected Input Values**: There may be inconsistencies in the input data format, such as missing values or incorrect data types, that are not being properly validated or handled before processing.
*   **LLM Access Failure:** The system's inability to access the designated LLM (e.g., 'gemini-pro'), leading to a complete failure to generate any output. This can be due to incorrect API key configuration, unavailability of the model, or network connectivity issues. *Example: Iteration 12.*
*   **API Key Configuration Issues:** Incorrectly setting or failing to retrieve the API key from the environment (e.g., the environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) prevents the system from accessing the LLM. *Example: Iteration 12.*
*   **Empty Output Grid:** Frequently returns an empty list `[[]]`, indicating a breakdown in grid manipulation or output formatting.
*   **Inability to Generate Valid Output:** The system fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training examples and apply them to the test input.
*   **Complex Reasoning:** The system struggles with questions that require complex reasoning about spatial relationships or value dependencies within the grid.
*   **Over-Reliance on Memorization:** The LLM seems to memorize training examples rather than generalizing the transformation logic.
*   **Inability to Abstract Complex Rules:** The dataset requires the abstraction of non-linear relationships and contextual dependencies within the grid.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Generalization:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation patterns from the training examples.
*   **Pattern Misinterpretation:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation logic from the training examples.
*   **Inability to abstract general rules:** The model fails to generalize from the limited examples to novel test inputs.
*   **Incorrect Application:** Even when the LLM correctly identifies the transformation, it struggles to apply it to the test input.
*   **Lack of Spatial Precision:** LLMs sometimes struggle with precise spatial relationships within the grid. The system struggles to place transformed elements in the correct positions within the output grid, suggesting a weakness in understanding and applying the spatial logic of the transformation.
*   **Dimensionality Mismatch:** The LLM generates output grids with incorrect dimensions compared to the expected output grid.
*   **Shape and Dimensionality Errors:** The generated output grids often have incorrect shapes or dimensions compared to the expected output.
*   **Output Format Mismatch:** The generated output grid does not match the size or shape expected by the golden answer, even if the values have some correctness.
*   **Incorrect Value Mapping:** Even when the dimensions are correct, the LLM fails to map values correctly. The numerical relationships between corresponding cells in the input and output grids are not accurately learned and applied.
*   **Incorrect Element Replacement:** The system might be identifying the correct structure, but using the wrong numbers.
*   **Value Errors:** The system generates grids containing numbers not present in the target grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** The LLM outputs the response as a string containing Python code that *would* define the output grid, rather than directly outputting the grid.
*   **Ambiguity:** The transformations are implicit and can be interpreted in multiple ways from just a few examples.
*   **Complexity:** The underlying transformations might be complex involving combinations of replication, shifting, value changes, and so on.
*   **Inability to Extract Accurate Transformation Rules:** The system consistently fails to extract accurate and generalizable transformation rules from the training examples.
*   **Fragility of Pattern Recognition:** The system's pattern recognition approach is fragile and easily disrupted by small variations in the input grids.
*   **Lack of Rule Validation:** The system's rule validation process is not robust enough to catch inaccurate or incomplete rules.
*   **Localized Contextual Analysis Insufficient:** The LLM struggles to generalize even seemingly simple local rules across the entire grid.
*   **Oversimplification of Transformations:** The LLM tends to oversimplify the transformation rules, leading to incorrect outputs.
*   **Complex Rule Interpretation:** The system struggles when the transformation involves multiple intertwined rules.
*   **Incomplete Generalization:** The model fails to accurately generalize rules based on limited examples.
*   **In-place vs. New Object Confusion:** The model is getting confused with modifying the input grid vs. creating a new output grid.
*   **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** In cases where the transformation involves mirroring, the implemented logic is sometimes flawed, leading to incorrect placements of mirrored elements or unintended modifications.
*   **Positional Transformation Neglect:** The system is unable to accurately capture how the grid modifies elements and their positions to produce the result.
*   **Difficulty with complex value dependencies:** The model struggles when the transformation relies on complex combinations or relationships between different values in the grid.
*   **Misinterpretation of spatial relationships:** The model incorrectly interprets how objects and values in the grid are spatially related and how these relationships change during the transformation.
*   **Misinterpretation of Visual Features:** The `analyze_visual_features` step is prone to misinterpreting the key visual features of the grid.
*   **Inconsistent Transformation Application:** The primary failure mode is the inconsistent application of identified transformation rules to the test input.
*   **Ambiguous Transformations:** Some training examples might have multiple possible interpretations, leading the LLM to learn an incorrect or incomplete transformation.
*   **Error in output format**: The model can reason correctly about the grid transformation, but then output a grid of the incorrect size, or even the correct size but as text rather than code.
*   **Dimensionality and Element Distribution:** The approach fails when faced with new input grids that have different dimensions or element distributions compared to the training examples.
*   **Error in Transformation:** The LLM sometimes produces an error rather than a valid transformation.
*   **Overfitting to Superficial Patterns:** The system tends to overfit to simple patterns in the training examples (Iteration 13).
*   **Inability to Generalize Complex Rules:** The system struggles with complex transformation rules that involve relationships between different elements or regions of the grid (Iteration 13). The transformation logic often requires spatial reasoning which the LLM fails to capture (Iteration 13).
*   **Output validation inadequate:** Relying on an LLM for output validation may be flawed.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Identification:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the transformation pattern from the limited training examples.
*   **Inability to Handle Number Transformations:** The LLM struggles with generalizing the transformation of numbers within the grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** Even when the LLM identifies a possible pattern, the generated code often contains logical errors or fails to translate the pattern into correct grid manipulation.
*   **Ignoring Existing Grid Values:** The model struggles with transformations that require *both* copying values *and* introducing a fill value.
*   **Context-Switching Errors:** The model struggles to perform different transformations in the same grid at once.
*   **No Fallback Mechanisms:** The system doesn't seem to have robust error handling or fallback mechanisms when the LLM-based transformation fails. The absence of these recovery measures leads to complete failure.
*   **Lack of Output Constraints:** The LLM is not constrained to produce valid numerical grids.
*   **Incorrect coordinate application:** Even when the LLM identifies a pattern, the coordinate transformation is sometimes misapplied, leading to numbers appearing in the wrong locations in the output grid.
*   **Combined Analytical and Application Complexity:** The complexity of relying on the LLM to both analyze visual features AND apply the transformation, requires a perfect output format which is difficult to guarantee. *Example: Iteration 23.*

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

*   **Focus on ensuring the correct output format.** Debug the `apply_transformation` function to explicitly construct and return a nested list. Implement rigorous type checking and data validation to catch formatting errors.
*   **Consider separating the LLM's analytical and application tasks.**  Use the LLM to identify the transformation rules, but implement *explicit code* to perform the transformation on the grid. This will give more control over the output format. For example, instead of having the LLM directly generate the output grid, have it identify a transformation like "duplicate the top-left 3x3 block to the bottom-right," and then write code to *implement* that rule.
*   **Explore data preprocessing techniques.** Investigate methods to simplify the grid representations or highlight relevant visual features to improve the LLM's ability to analyze the patterns.
*   **Explicit Dimension Handling:** Design the system to explicitly verify and enforce the output grid dimensions based on the input grids in the training examples. A function can be created to extract the output dimension based on the input dimension. This could include pre-processing steps to extract the dimension, or post-processing steps to enforce it.
*   **Improve Pattern Generalization:** Implement a mechanism to explicitly encourage the LLM to focus on relationships *between* elements and regions in the input/output grids. For example, prompt the LLM to find "if number 8 is present in region A, then replace all number 4s in region B with number 3."
*   **Decompose Numerical Mapping:** Instead of letting the LLM directly predict numerical substitutions, force it to extract rules for *how* numbers change. Is it an arithmetic operation? A cyclic shift? The LLM needs to make this explicit.
*   **Augment Training Examples:** Provide more varied training examples to force the LLM to generalize beyond memorization of specific grid layouts and number mappings. Intentionally create examples that have similar *rules* but different *appearances.*
*   **Explicit Spatial Reasoning:** Improve the prompts to encourage the LLM to explicitly describe spatial relationships. Use language that forces the LLM to define the location of the transformed elements relative to other elements or regions. "Shift the contents of region A two positions to the right" is better than "transform region A."
*   **Reinforce Spatial Reasoning:** Provide the LLM with more focused training examples that emphasize spatial relationships. For example, include examples where the transformation depends on the relative position of elements within the grid.
*   **Coordinate Transformation:** Consider more direct coordinate transformations to supplement the knowledge graph approach. If the model could recognize which coordinates change value, and how, the problem could be simplified.
*   **Iterative KG Refinement:** Implement a feedback loop where the LLM can iteratively refine the knowledge graph based on errors in the transformation.
*   **Focus on Debugging and Correctness:** Prioritize debugging the core logic responsible for grid manipulation and output generation. Ensure that the system correctly parses the input grids, applies the inferred transformation, and formats the output grid according to the expected structure.
*   **Robust Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate the input grid to ensure it contains only expected numerical values and has the correct dimensions. Handle cases where the input data deviates from the expected format.
*   **Null/None Handling:** Add explicit checks for `None` values *before* any numerical comparison or operation. Implement strategies to handle `None` values gracefully (e.g., default values, error messages, retries). Ensure proper initialization of all numerical variables.
*   **LLM Output Validation and Constraints:** Constrain the LLM to produce valid numerical outputs that conform to the grid's expected data type. Add validation checks to the LLM's output to ensure it can be safely used in subsequent processing steps. Implement fallback logic if the LLM returns invalid data.
*   **Implement Error Recovery:** Incorporate mechanisms to detect and recover from errors during the LLM-based transformation process. This could involve retrying with a different prompt, using a simplified transformation strategy, or returning a default result.
*   **Prioritize LLM Access and Error Handling:** Verify LLM access and improve error handling within the `call_llm` function.
*   **Enhanced Feature Analysis:** The `analyze_visual_features` function needs significant improvement. Exploring more sophisticated feature extraction techniques and incorporating spatial reasoning capabilities.
*   **Refine Transformation Application:** Enhance the `apply_transformation` function to accurately apply the inferred transformations to the test input grid.
*   **Implement Robust Output Validation:** Implement a comprehensive validation step to check the dimensions, value ranges, and overall structure of the output grid. Reject invalid outputs and provide informative error messages for debugging.
*   **Implement a More Robust Rule Extraction Mechanism:** Develop a mechanism that can identify and formalize the transformation rules in a more abstract and general way. This could involve using a combination of symbolic reasoning and visual feature analysis.
*   **Focus on Spatial Relationships:** Emphasize the importance of spatial relationships between grid elements in the prompting strategy.

*   **Incorporate a More Fine-Grained Validation Process:** Implement a validation process that checks the individual steps of the transformation, rather than just the final result.
*   **Enhanced Example Descriptions:** Provide more structured information to the LLM, emphasizing key elements like grid dimensions and relationships between input and output.
*   **Transformation Validation:** Implement a more robust validation step for the transformation descriptions generated by the LLM.
*   **Reinforce Spatial Reasoning:** Modify the prompts to explicitly encourage spatial reasoning.
*   **Refine Output Formatting:** Implement stricter output format validation to ensure the LLM generates the grid in the exact required structure.
*   **Enhanced Feature Analysis:** Prompt the LLM to explicitly identify the *type* of transformation (e.g., "maximum value in a subgrid," "rotation," "reflection," "number replacement based on neighbor values") before attempting to describe it in detail.
*   **Targeted Examples:** Carefully select training examples that represent a wider variety of transformations and edge cases to improve pattern generalization.
*   **Code Generation Fine-Tuning:** Encourage the LLM to generate a *validated* code implementation of the transformation rules. Add instructions to test the code by running the training examples, and fix it if the output is incorrect.
*   **Explicit Spatial Reasoning:** If spatial relationships are involved, provide the LLM with explicit spatial reasoning tools, such as functions to calculate distances, identify neighbors, or perform rotations/reflections on grid elements.
*   **Improved Output Validation:** Implement a more robust validation function that can evaluate the *logic* of the transformation in the output grid, rather than just its format.
*   **Introduce Explicit Rule Extraction:** Focus on methods that first extract explicit transformation rules from the training examples and then apply those rules to the test input.
*   **Decompose the Transformation Process:** Decompose the transformation process into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, identifying specific regions or elements to transform, determining the transformation operation, and applying the operation.
*   **Increase Training Data Diversity:** Supplement the training data with more diverse examples that cover different grid dimensions, element distributions, and transformation patterns.
*   **Explore Hybrid Approaches:** Investigate hybrid approaches that combine the LLM's reasoning abilities with more traditional algorithms for pattern recognition and grid manipulation.

*   **Implement a Dimension Inference Module:** Develop a module that explicitly infers the dimensions of the output grid based on the training examples before attempting value transformations.
*   **Train for positional reasoning**: It's not enough to know what values to change. The system must reason about *where* to change them.
*   **Rethink the LLM Agent Roles:** Re-evaluate the roles of the LLM agents.
*   **Incorporate Validation Steps:** Add validation steps to ensure the generated output grid adheres to patterns observed in the training examples, such as value distributions and dimension ratios.
*   **Consider a Hybrid Approach:** Explore a hybrid approach that combines LLM-based reasoning with traditional image processing techniques for feature extraction and pattern recognition.
*   **Focus on Rule Decomposition:** Explicitly decompose the transformation rule into smaller, more manageable sub-rules.
*   **Implement a More Structured Validation Process:** Develop a more rigorous validation process that checks for specific aspects of the transformation, such as element counts and row/column patterns.
*   **Explore Explicit Coordinate-Based Rules:** Shift the representation of rules to be more explicit about coordinates.
*   **Generate More Diverse Training Data:** Consider augmenting the training dataset with examples that cover a wider range of transformation types and complexities.
*   **Add unit tests:** Add unit tests for `transform_grid` function.
*   **Enhanced Rule Extraction:** Refine the `extract_transformation_rule` agent to focus explicitly on identifying the source locations of numbers to be replicated. Implement a mechanism to distinguish between "source" values and "filler" values.
*   **Value-Specific Propagation:** Modify the `refine_transformation_rule` and `apply_transformation` agents to ensure that the correct values are being propagated based on their source locations. Get rid of '5' fill value issue.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** Test a combination of explicit rule-based transformations (hard-coded logic for common patterns) with the LLM-based agents.
*   **Context Aware Prompting:** Change the prompting strategy to explicitly instruct agents to be aware of the grid context during transformations.

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example

            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

    "question": "PASSAGE: Troops of Montenegro supported the revolt and captured 12 Ottoman soldiers and imprisoned them in Podgorica. The first serious attempt of the Ottoman government to suppress the revolt resulted with the Battle of De\u00e7iq. Terenzio Tocci gathered the Mirdite chieftains on 26 April 1911 in Orosh, proclaimed the independence of Albania, raised the flag of Albania  and established the provisional government. Shefqet Turgut Pasha wanted to meet this threat and returned to the region with 8.000 soldiers. As soon as he reached Shkod\u00ebr on 11 May, he issued a general proclamation which declared martial law and offered an amnesty for all rebels  if they immediately return to their homes. After Ottoman troops entered the area Tocci fled the empire abandoning his activities. On 14 May, three days after his poclamation, Shefqet Turgut Pasha ordered his troops to seize De\u010di\u0107, hill that overlooked Tuzi. Sixty Albanian chieftains rejected Turgut Pasha's proclamation on their meeting in Podgorica on 18 May. After almost a month of intense fightings rebels were trapped and their only choices were either to die fighting, to surrender or to flee to Montenegro. Most of the rebels chose to flee to Montenegro which became a base for large number of rebels determined to attack the Ottoman Empire. Ismail Kemal Bey and Tiranli Cemal bey traveled from Italy to Montenegro at the end of May and met the rebels to convince them to adopt the nationalistic agenda which they eventually did. On 12 June Porte prematurely proclaimed that the revolt had ended.\n\nQUESTION: How many months after the chieftains rejected Turgut Pasha's proclamation did Porte proclaim the revolt had ended?",

    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's inability to provide fully complete answers, which sometimes lack essential context, units, or modifiers that are present in the golden answer. While the extracted information is often accurate, the completeness of the response is not always guaranteed."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 5,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the **misinterpretation of the question's specific intent**, leading the system to extract the wrong information or perform irrelevant calculations. In particular, the system's semantic processing needs improvement to handle subtle nuances in the question."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 6,
    "issue": "The primary issue is **inconsistent and unreliable arithmetic calculation, compounded by a lack of rigorous answer verification before output**. Even simple addition or subtraction sometimes fails, and the system doesn't catch these errors before finalizing the answer. This, coupled with inconsistent unit handling, reduces the trustworthiness of the entire process."

    "iteration": 8,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the failure of the question type determination module. This module needs to be redesigned or debugged to correctly classify the types of questions being asked (e.g., comparison, extraction, calculation). The validation logic needs to be checked for correctness or adjusted."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 9,

]

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Implement more print statements:** Add more print statements, especially when numerical computations are performed, so that one can track how numerical data and question data is extracted and utilized by the AI system.",
  "Enhance Reasoning Chain for Temporal Questions:** When the question involves time-related calculations, force the system to explicitly state the start date, end date, and the steps used to calculate the time difference. This will allow for easier debugging.",
  "Implement Semantic Similarity Measures:** Utilize semantic similarity metrics (e.g., word embeddings, sentence embeddings) to compare the question with different parts of the passage. This will help the system identify the most relevant information and avoid focusing on irrelevant details.",
  "Refine Question Parsing:** Implement more sophisticated techniques for question parsing, including dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, and question type classification. This will enable the system to better understand the relationships between words and phrases in the question.",
  "Implement Date Parsing and Calculation:** Integrate a robust date parsing library to accurately extract date information from the passage. Then, use built-in date difference functions (e.g., from the `datetime` module in Python) to calculate the exact number of months between the dates.",
  "Add Unit Tests Focused on Time-Based Reasoning:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically designed to test the system's temporal reasoning capabilities, including questions that require calculating time differences in days, weeks, months, and years.",
  "Add Temporal Reasoning Module:** Implement a dedicated module for temporal reasoning that can handle date calculations, time intervals, and event ordering.",
  "Prompt Engineering:** Use prompt engineering to explicitly ask the LLM to extract all relevant numbers and their corresponding units and then perform the calculation. For example: \"Extract all numbers corresponding to the entities and their units. What arithmetic operations should be performed to arrive at the answer? Perform the calculation and give the final answer.\"",
  "Introduce Contrastive Learning:** Train the system using contrastive learning techniques, where it's presented with pairs of similar questions that require different answers. This will help the system learn to differentiate between subtle nuances in question wording.",
  "Answer type classification:** Before generating the final answer, classify the question based on the expected answer type (e.g., numerical, descriptive, boolean). Use this classification to guide the answer generation process. For example, if the expected answer type is numerical, prioritize extracting numbers and performing calculations."

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return solution_result["solution"]

        def extract_entities_with_verification(question, max_attempts=3):

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 10 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.80) ===
Approach: The script uses a "Holistic Reading & Arithmetic Reasoner" agent to answer questions by combining reading comprehension and arithmetic problem-solving in a single step, using the Gemini LLM. The problem is approached holistically, with the agent reasoning about the question and passage to formulate an answer and extracting relevant numerical quantities, and then uses a verification step to determine the validity of the answer. The `HolisticReadingArithmeticReasoner` class contains the `answer_question` and `_reason_about_question` functions to provide the answer and reasoning, and `call_llm` sends prompts to the Gemini LLM. The `main` function initializes the `HolisticReadingArithmeticReasoner` and returns the answer to the question.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 8 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: This script uses LLM-driven chain-of-thought reasoning and verification to answer questions, first determining if the question is numerical or general. Numerical questions are processed by extracting numbers and performing calculations, while general questions are decomposed into sub-questions, have information extracted for each, and then synthesize an answer. The script defines specialized agents for question type determination, numerical information extraction, calculation, question decomposition, information extraction, and answer synthesis; each leverages examples and a validation step.

The functions used are:
- `main()`: Orchestrates the entire process.
- `determine_question_type()`: Determines question type.
- `process_numerical_question()`: Processes numerical questions.
- `extract_numerical_info()`: Extracts numerical data.
- `calculate_answer()`: Calculates numerical answers.
- `process_general_question()`: Processes general questions.
- `decompose_question()`: Decomposes complex questions.
- `extract_information()`: Extracts information from decomposed questions.
- `synthesize_answer()`: Synthesizes the final answer.
- `call_llm()`: Calls the Gemini LLM with a prompt.

The overall workflow is as follows: `main()` calls `determine_question_type()`, then either `process_numerical_question()` which uses `extract_numerical_info()` and `calculate_answer()`, or `process_general_question()` which uses `decompose_question()`, `extract_information()`, and `synthesize_answer()`, with all *process, extract, calculate, decompose, and synthesize* functions using `call_llm()` to interact with the LLM.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 7 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with verification to answer questions, first determining the question type (numerical or general) and then processing it accordingly. Numerical questions are processed by extracting numerical information and then calculating the answer, while general questions are processed by decomposing the question into sub-questions, extracting information based on those sub-questions, and synthesizing the answer. The agent roles include a question type identifier, numerical information extractor, calculator, and (implicitly) a question decomposer and answer synthesizer.

The functions used are: `main` which orchestrates the process, `determine_question_type` to identify the type of question, `process_numerical_question` and `process_general_question` to handle the different question types, `extract_numerical_info` to extract numerical values, `calculate_answer` to perform calculations, `decompose_question` to break down general questions, `extract_information` to gather relevant details, and `synthesize_answer` to formulate the final response. The `call_llm` function is called within each of these functions. The overall workflow involves determining the question type, processing it based on its type (numerical or general), and returning the answer or an error message if any step fails.

# DATASET-SPECIFIC LEARNINGS & EXPERIMENT LOG

This document tracks our evolving understanding and experimental findings related to the question answering task on the current dataset. It serves as a long-term memory to guide future research and development efforts.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **General:**
    *   The dataset consists of passages describing events (primarily American football games), followed by questions about the details.
    *   Questions are fact-based, requiring information retrieval and processing directly from the passage. No external knowledge is needed.
    *   Questions often involve numerical reasoning (arithmetic, comparisons) and general knowledge application.
    *   Passages can be lengthy, requiring careful reading.
    *   Case sensitivity is observed.
    *   Questions often involve comparing or relating two or more pieces of information in the passage.
    *   Questions frequently ask for numerical information (quantities, dates, names), requiring precise extraction and comparison.
    *   Passages often present multiple entities or events; questions require distinguishing between them and relating correct information.
    *   Questions may require synthesizing information from multiple sentences or inferring from disparate facts.
    *   Many questions involve interpreting percentages or proportions, requiring correct identification of the base number.
    *   Questions often test the understanding of specific terminology within the passage's context.
    *   Questions often require understanding of sports game summaries, particularly football.
    *   Questions often involve numerical reasoning based on events within the passage (e.g., counting touchdowns, calculating yardage differences).
    *   Questions can be complex, requiring differentiation between types of scoring events and temporal reasoning.
    *   Questions often require extracting relevant dates from a passage and then calculating the difference between them. The wording is precise, requiring careful attention to specific events and timelines.
    *   Passages contain extraneous information; therefore, the agent must be able to identify and extract specific dates relevant to the question.

*   **Date/Time Reasoning:**
    *   A recurring pattern is the need to calculate durations (years, months, days) based on dates or time spans mentioned in the passage. This requires precise arithmetic and attention to inclusivity/exclusivity.

*   **Explicit Information Retrieval:**
    *   The questions often require directly extracting and processing information explicitly stated in the passage, rather than making complex inferences.

*   **Numeric Answers:**
    *   Many questions seek numeric answers, making them easily verifiable but also sensitive to arithmetic errors.

*   **Question Structure:**
    *   All questions follow the format: `"PASSAGE:\n[passage text]\n\nQUESTION: [question text]"`.
    *   Many questions involve numerical reasoning and comparison (e.g., "How many yards longer...", "Which star has a smaller mass...").
    *   Some questions ask for specific entities (e.g., "Who caught the final touchdown...", "Who threw the second longest touchdown pass?").
    *   Questions frequently ask for numerical information (e.g., "How many...?", "How many yards...?").

*   **Answer Structure:**
    *   Answers are typically short phrases, numbers, or names.

*   **Passage Structure:**
    *   Passages vary in content (sports summaries, scientific descriptions like astronomy).
    *   Sports passages often involve more complex event tracking, which poses extraction challenges.
    *   Passages are dense with numbers, requiring precise parsing, especially in sports narratives.

*   **Domain Knowledge:**
    *   Basic sports terminology (football positions, scoring) is needed for sports-related examples.
    *   General reading comprehension is crucial.
    *   For demographic examples, basic understanding of fertility rates is needed.

*   **Question Types:**
    *   Entity Extraction: Identifying specific players or entities.
    *   Numerical Comparison: Comparing numerical values (yards, scores, TFR, mass) to determine differences.
    *   Counting: Counting the number of occurrences of an event or entity.

*   **Reasoning Types:**
    *   Direct Extraction: Finding the answer directly stated in the passage.
    *   Simple Arithmetic: Performing basic calculations (addition, subtraction) using numbers from the passage.
    *   Logical Deduction: Combining information from different parts of the passage to arrive at the answer.

*   **Non-Obvious Patterns:**
    *   Chronological order of events is important. Time-related keywords (e.g., "final," "first," "later," "second") help narrow the search.

*   **Edge Cases/Complexities:**
    *   Passages with ambiguous or contradictory information.
    *   Questions requiring more complex arithmetic operations (e.g., multiplication, division).
    *   Questions with implicit rather than explicit answers, requiring deeper inference.
    *   Handling of units (yards, points, etc.) consistently.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Keyword-Based Retrieval:** Identify keywords from the question and search for those keywords in the passage.
*   **LLM-Based Extraction & Reasoning:** Use an LLM to directly answer the question based on the passage; prompting is key.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** Combine keyword retrieval with LLM reasoning.
*   **Question Decomposition:** Decompose the question into smaller sub-questions. Breaking down complex questions into smaller, more manageable extraction tasks improves accuracy.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT):** Breaking down complex questions into smaller steps (decomposition, information extraction, synthesis) improves interpretability. However, effectiveness is limited by the system's ability to accurately understand the question's intent and extract relevant numerical data.
*   **Zero-Shot Reasoning:** Directly ask the LLM to answer the question based on the passage, using a well-crafted prompt.
*   **Text Splitting:** If passages are too long, split them into smaller chunks. Be mindful of context loss.
*   **Focus on Answer Synthesis:** Prioritize improving the `synthesize_answer` function.
*   **Specialized Agents:** The use of specialized agents (question decomposer, information extraction expert, answer synthesis expert) allows for a modular approach. Individual role definitions for LLMs need definition.
*   **Sequential Workflow:** The sequential workflow (decompose, extract, synthesize) enforces a structured problem-solving approach.
*   **Question-Type Determination and Specialized Processing:** Determine the question type (numerical vs. general) and use specialized processing. Failure in question type determination renders the entire system useless.
*   **LLM-Driven Techniques with Verification:** Combining LLM-driven techniques with verification steps at each stage is a successful pattern. However, verification is inadequate for semantic errors that stem from misinterpreting the question.
*   **Dynamic Approach Selection:** Adapting the strategy based on the type of question being asked proves important.
*   **Extraction of Relevant Information:** The system has a strength in extracting relevant information from the passage.
*   **Leveraging distinct agent roles:** Question decomposer, information extraction expert, answer synthesizer help specialize the tasks.
*   **Chain-of-thought for focusing information extraction:** Aids in focusing the information extraction process.
*   **Validating intermediate steps:** Decomposition and extraction likely contributes to the overall accuracy.
*   Providing examples in LLM prompts improves performance.
*   Explicitly prompting the LLM to show its work (intermediate calculations) helps in debugging.
*   **Self-Debate:** The self-debate strategy *attempts* to address potential errors. The agent tries to verify their answers. The agent recognizes the importance of calculation but isn't consistently accurate.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **General Script Errors:**
    *   `NameError: name 'call_llm' is not defined`. This prevents any actual processing.
*   **Root Cause: Incorrect Question Type Determination:** The entire system fails because the `determine_question_type()` function consistently returns an error. This highlights that the question type determination module is a single point of failure.
*   **Temporal Reasoning Errors:** The primary failure mode involves incorrect calculation of the number of months between two dates mentioned in the passage. This indicates a deficiency in the system's temporal arithmetic capabilities.
*   **Answer Synthesis Failure:** Inability to synthesize a valid answer, even when the correct information is extracted.
    *   The system struggles to provide fully complete answers, especially when context, units, or modifiers from the original passage are needed.
*   **Sports narrative complexity:** Questions about sports narratives can induce errors because they require understanding of event order and accurate extraction of details.
*   **Validation sensitivity:** Validation checks can be overly strict.
*   **Information Extraction Failure:** Errors in information extraction contribute to failures in answer synthesis. Inaccurate or incomplete extracted information leads to incorrect final answers. The agent struggles to correctly extract relevant information from the passages when multiple dates are present, leading to confusion in the arithmetic step.
*   **Ambiguous Passages:** Passages with ambiguous or contradictory information can lead to incorrect answers.
*   **Missing Information:** If the answer cannot be found in the passage, this leads to a failure.
*   **Lack of Arithmetic Reasoning:** Inability to perform arithmetic operations, particularly simple addition.
*   **Potential for Masked Limitations:** High accuracy can mask the system's vulnerability to more complex reasoning.
*   **Numerical extraction errors:** Incorrectly identifying or extracting numerical values from the passage.
*   **Calculation errors:** Performing incorrect arithmetic operations on extracted numbers.
*   **Information extraction errors:** Failing to identify and extract the correct information to answer general questions.
*   **Synthesis errors:** Generating a response that is not a coherent or accurate answer to the question.
*   **Question type misclassification**: Incorrectly classifying a question as numerical or general.
*   **Unit Handling:** Lack of proper unit handling leads to incomplete or misinterpreted answers.
*   **Misinterpretation of Question Intent:** The system struggles to accurately interpret the nuances of the question.
*   **Incorrect Numerical Calculation:** The system makes errors in numerical calculations.
*   **Lack of Verification:** The system lacks a final answer verification step to check the reasonableness of the answer.
*   **Numerical Extraction in Dense Passages:** Difficulty in accurately extracting numerical values and associating them with the correct entities.
*   **Off-by-One Errors in Duration Calculation:** Consistently making off-by-one errors when calculating the duration between two dates or years.
    *   **Misinterpretation of Inclusion/Exclusion:** The agent sometimes struggles to correctly interpret whether the start and end dates/years should be included in the duration calculation.

    *   **Goal:** Improve handling of date/time reasoning, specifically duration calculations.
    *   **Finding:** The "Reading Comprehension Expert" agent with self-debate, in its current form, is not robust enough to prevent common arithmetic errors, especially off-by-one errors in duration calculation.
    *   **Finding:** The agent's general reasoning capabilities are insufficient for accurate duration calculations.
    *   **Finding:** Self-Debate Alone Is Insufficient: The agent identifies the potential for errors but fails to consistently avoid them.
*   **ITERATION 10:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.80
    *   **Goal:** Improve handling of date/time reasoning with a "Holistic Reading & Arithmetic Reasoner".
    *   **Finding:** The approach demonstrates a significant weakness in accurately calculating time differences, even when the relevant dates are explicitly provided.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that a holistic approach would avoid decomposition errors is not fully supported. The approach correctly handles some form of reading comprehension and extraction but fails during a specific arithmetic operation.

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

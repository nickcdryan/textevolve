        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Implement Visualization Tools:** Consider implementing tools to visualize the grid transformations. This could help developers better understand the patterns and identify potential errors in the system's reasoning.",
  "Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data with variations of the existing examples, such as rotated, flipped, or scaled versions of the grids. This could help the system learn to generalize the transformations to different grid sizes and arrangements.",
  "Introduce Intermediate Checks:** Add print statements/intermediate outputs within the reasoning process to track the values of variables and the state of the grid at various stages. This will provide greater visibility into the system's reasoning and help identify the exact point where errors occur. The most valuable intermediate outputs would be the \"explicit rule\" at each stage and the transformed grid at each step of processing.",
  "Implement Rule Verification Function:** Create a function that explicitly checks the validity of a derived rule against all training examples. This function should flag any inconsistencies or contradictions.",
  "More Careful Analysis of Training Cases:** The system appears to be applying a range of transformations, but some of them are wrong. It is incorrectly mapping from column 6 in the training examples to column 9 in the test example, and the propagation rules are also inaccurate.",
  "Refine Pattern Extraction Logic:** Re-evaluate the logic used to extract patterns from the grids. Consider incorporating more sophisticated image processing techniques or machine learning models for pattern recognition. This is especially critical because Visual Feature Analysis is not currently working effectively.",
  "Add Error Logging:** Log any errors or inconsistencies detected during the rule verification process. This will help track the frequency and types of errors that occur.",
  "Test Simple Cases First:** Before tackling complex transformations, ensure the system can reliably handle simple transformations like rotations and reflections. Create a set of test cases specifically designed to evaluate these basic spatial reasoning skills.",
  "Incorporate spatial reasoning techniques:** Explore methods for incorporating spatial reasoning into the system, such as using convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks to model the relationships between different cells in the grid.",
  "Introduce a more robust pattern recognition and abstraction module:** This module should be able to identify and extract the core transformation rules from the training examples, representing them in a more abstract and generalizable form. For instance, using a convolutional neural network to extract common patterns, or a graphical representation of patterns."

    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)

                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

        

            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, I've synthesized the existing knowledge with the new learnings from Iteration 29, ensuring all existing information is preserved, the document length is reduced and the focus remains on concrete, task-specific insights for the Grid Transformation Task dataset.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   **Question Format:** Tasks are "Grid Transformation Tasks" with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" (input/output grid pairs labeled "Input Grid," "Output Grid") and a "TEST INPUT" grid. The objective is to generate the "OUTPUT GRID" for the test input, following patterns from the training examples.
*   **Consistent Structure:** Questions follow a consistent structure: header, training examples, test input, and transformation instruction.
*   **Grid Representation:** Grids are nested lists of integers (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`). Dimensions vary (e.g., 10x10 or 17x17). Grids are typically small matrices of integers, often with a background value (e.g., 0) and a few other distinct values that participate in the transformation rules. Input and Output grid have consistent dimensions within a question, but may vary between training and test grids.
*   **Mixed Element Types:** Grids contain a mix of elements, including zeros and other numerical values, potentially representing 'border' and 'inner' values.
*   **Training Examples followed by Test Input:** Problems structured with training examples, followed by a test input.
*   **Abstracted Transformations:** Transformations are implicit and must be inferred from training examples. This requires identifying both content-based and spatial patterns. Structure often involves maintaining most of the grid while transforming specific numbers based on their spatial relationships.
*   **Transformation Logic:** The core challenge is identifying the transformation logic, often involving spatial manipulations (e.g., diagonal shifts, expansions, alternating patterns, boundary adherence, region swapping). Rules often *localized* or dependent on subgrid characteristics. New elements can be placed at new locations based on spatial relationships.
*   **Implicit Rules:** Transformation logic is *never* explicitly stated.
*   **Abstract Rules:** The underlying transformation rules are abstract and not immediately obvious.
*   **Few-Shot Learning Format:** Questions are presented in a few-shot format.
*   **Varying Grid Sizes:** Transformations might be size-dependent. Output grid size may differ from input grid.
*   **Multiple Possible Rules:** Different transformations might yield similar training results but diverge on the test data.
*   **Value Dependencies:** A cell's new value may depend on multiple other cells.
*   **Asymmetric Transformations:** Transformation might not be symmetrical.
*   **Value Encoding:** Specific values within the grids (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9) have semantic meaning related to the transformation.
*   **Element Distribution:** Performance impacted by different element distributions between training and test grids. Grids vary significantly in size and value distribution. Sparse (mostly zeros) vs. dense patterns exist.
*   **Limited Training Examples:** Limited examples (typically 1-3) make robust generalization challenging.
*   **Zero Prevalence:** Many grids contain a significant number of zeros. Non-zero values often represent distinct visual elements.
*   **Limited Integer Values:** Grids contain a limited set of integer values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8).
*   **Inconsistent Input-Output Size:** LLM struggles with size differences between input and output grids, even when training and test examples are inconsistent.
*   **Varied Transformation Rules:** Diverse rules ranging from neighbor-based replacement to tiling/replication patterns.
*   **Combined transformations:** Struggles with multiple rules within a single grid, combining copying and fill values, or performing different transformations simultaneously.
*   **Implicit spatial relationships:** Struggles to discern spatial aspects and accurately capture how the grid modifies elements and positions.
*   **Rotations/Reflections:** Transformations can involve element rotations, reflections, or more complex pattern propagations.
*   **Pattern Complexity:** The patterns involve region swapping and number replacements. The complexity varies significantly; some patterns are simple row/column shifts or substitutions, while others involve non-linear transformations or combinations of changes in subgrids.
*   **Element-wise transformations:** Training examples demonstrate element-wise transformations based on visual features and patterns within the grid. Specific numbers might trigger changes in neighboring cells, or overall arrangements of numbers could imply a transformation.
*   **Small Integers:** Grids contain small integers, and tasks often involve identifying relationships between different numbers within the grid (e.g., 5s causing modifications to 0s or 1s).

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   **None consistently effective:** Given the consistently low accuracy, no single strategy has emerged as reliably effective for this dataset (Iteration 22: Accuracy 0.33, Iteration 23: Accuracy 0.00, Iteration 24: Accuracy 0.00, Iteration 25: Accuracy 0.00, Iteration 26: Accuracy 0.00, Iteration 27: Accuracy 0.00, Iteration 28: Accuracy 0.33, Iteration 29: Accuracy 0.00).
*   **LLM-based Visual Feature Analysis (Potentially Useful):** Using an LLM to analyze the visual features and infer transformation rules is a promising approach, but generalization remains a major challenge. The attempt to decompose the problem into visual feature analysis and transformation application is a potentially sound strategy, *if* the model can accurately perform the feature analysis.
*   **Two-Step LLM Approach (Potentially Useful):** The two-step LLM approach (analyze then apply) shows some promise, but is still insufficient for reliable generalization.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Specialized Agents (Inconsistent):** The chain-of-thought approach, with specialized expert agents for visual feature analysis and transformation application, shows promise but suffers from inconsistent performance due to the LLM's issues with generalization.
*   **Decomposition (Helpful):** Breaking down the problem into analyzing visual features and applying the transformation simplifies the task.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Multi-Example Prompts (Helpful):** Chain-of-thought prompting with multi-example prompts has been helpful in guiding the LLM to recognize patterns, but improvements are needed.
*   **Analogical Reasoning (Potentially Useful):** The analogical reasoning approach demonstrates potential in pattern recognition, but has not achieved high accuracy.
*   **Proper API Configuration (Critical):** API configuration is paramount for any LLM-based strategy to function. The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable must be correctly set, and the chosen LLM model (e.g., 'gemini-pro') must be accessible.
*   **LLM-guided recursive subdivision (Potentially Useful):** If transformations are locally consistent, then LLM-guided recursive subdivision *might* have potential.
*   **Coordinate-based transformation rules generated from an LLM (Potentially Useful):** At a basic level the LLM is able to correctly identify locations of numbers.
*   **Code Generation approach:** The LLM is successful at generating Python code to manipulate the grid data structures.
*   **Neighbor detection:** The model attempts to look at neighbors and perform transformations based on neighbor values.
*    **Region Identification (Potentially Useful):** The general idea of region identification might be useful.

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **Pattern Generalization:** The primary failure is the inability to generalize from training examples to the test input. The model seems to overfit the training examples, memorizing specific transformations rather than inferring the underlying logic. For example, if the training examples involve shifting a region to the right, the model may fail if the test input requires a shift to the left or a more complex transformation.
*   **Incorrect Rule Abstraction/Incomplete Transformations:** Inability to accurately infer the transformation rule from limited examples and then implement it. Often *describes* the rules but fails to *implement* them, stopping at outlining observed patterns. Sometimes, expansion logic favors certain values, leading to structurally dissimilar grids.
*   **Descriptive vs. Implementational Gap:** The agent can often *describe* the transformation rules but fails to *implement* them to produce the final numerical grid.

*   **Inability to Abstract Complex Rules:** Requires abstraction of non-linear relationships and contextual dependencies.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Generalization:** Fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation patterns.
*   **Incorrect Application:** Even when the LLM correctly identifies the transformation, it struggles to apply it to the test input.
*   **Lack of Spatial Precision:** Struggles with precise spatial relationships, failing to place transformed elements correctly.
*   **Dimensionality Mismatch:** Generates output grids with incorrect dimensions.
*   **Shape and Dimensionality Errors:** Generated output grids often have incorrect shapes or dimensions.
*   **Output Format Mismatch:** Output grid does not match the expected size or shape.
*   **Incorrect Value Mapping:** Fails to map values correctly.
*   **Incorrect Element Replacement:** Identifies correct structure but uses wrong numbers.
*   **Value Errors:** Generates grids containing numbers not present in the target grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** Outputs Python code rather than the grid itself.
*   **Ambiguity:** Transformations are implicit and can be interpreted in multiple ways.
*   **Complexity:** Transformations involve combinations of replication, shifting, value changes, etc.
*   **Inability to Extract Accurate Transformation Rules:** Consistently fails to extract accurate and generalizable rules.
*   **Fragility of Pattern Recognition:** Pattern recognition is fragile and easily disrupted by small variations.
*   **Lack of Rule Validation:** Rule validation is not robust enough.
*   **Localized Contextual Analysis Insufficient:** Struggles to generalize local rules across the entire grid.
*   **Oversimplification of Transformations:** Tends to oversimplify transformation rules.
*   **Complex Rule Interpretation:** Struggles with multiple intertwined rules.
*   **Incomplete Generalization:** Fails to accurately generalize rules based on limited examples.
*   **In-place vs. New Object Confusion:** Confused with modifying the input grid vs. creating a new output grid.
*   **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** Flawed mirroring logic leads to incorrect placements.
*   **Positional Transformation Neglect:** Unable to accurately capture how elements and positions change.
*   **Difficulty with complex value dependencies:** Struggles when the transformation relies on complex relationships between values.
*   **Misinterpretation of spatial relationships:** Incorrectly interprets how objects and values are spatially related.
*   **Misinterpretation of Visual Features:** `analyze_visual_features` prone to misinterpreting key features.
*   **Inconsistent Transformation Application:** Inconsistent application of identified rules.
*   **Ambiguous Transformations:** Training examples might have multiple interpretations.
*   **Error in output format**: Correct reasoning, but incorrect grid size or text output instead of code.
*   **Dimensionality and Element Distribution:** Fails with different dimensions or element distributions.
*   **Error in Transformation:** LLM produces an error rather than a valid transformation.
*   **Overfitting to Superficial Patterns:** Overfits to simple patterns (Iteration 13).
*   **Inability to Generalize Complex Rules:** Struggles with complex rules involving relationships between elements or regions (Iteration 13).
*   **Output validation inadequate:** Relying on an LLM for output validation may be flawed.

*   **No Fallback Mechanisms:** Lacks robust error handling or fallback mechanisms.
*   **Lack of Output Constraints:** Not constrained to produce valid numerical grids.
*   **Incorrect coordinate application:** Coordinate transformation misapplied.
*   **Combined Analytical and Application Complexity:** Requires perfect output format which is difficult to guarantee.
*   **Misinterpretation of Patterns:** Model incorrectly identified a pattern.
*   **Incorrect Transformation Implementation:** Implements incorrect code.
*   **Limitation of Simple CoT:** LLM unable to correctly interpret the problem transformation.
*   **Incorrect Corner Rotation:** Model identifies clockwise corner rotation but applies it incorrectly.
    *   **Misinterpreting Non-Zero Value Patterns:** Model struggles to decipher patterns in grids with non-zero values.
    *   **Faulty Reflection Logic:** Meta-reasoning agent fails to identify proper reflection.
    *   **Incorrect Region Identification/Transformation:** The LLM fails to identify key regions and the correct swapping pattern, leading to incorrect transformations of rows and columns. The LLM misinterprets the relevant features in the grids, failing to identify consistent regions and corresponding transformation rules between input and output grids.
*   **Matrix summarization/reduction instead of transformation:** The system consistently failed by outputting small, summarized matrices (e.g., 2x2) instead of transforming the full input grid based on the provided examples. This suggests the LLM struggled to understand the task as an element-wise transformation of a grid structure.
*   **Ignoring the input grid's dimensions:** The system failed to preserve the size/dimensions of the input grid during transformation. The expected outputs are grids of the same size as the test input grid.

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

*   **Improve Pattern Abstraction:**
    *   Prompt engineering: Explicitly prompt the LLM to describe the *transformation logic* in a general way (e.g., "rows 1-3 are copied to rows 5-7").
    *   Few-shot examples: Increase the number and diversity of training examples to expose the LLM to a wider range of possible transformations.
*   **Dimensionality Awareness:** Include explicit constraints or checks on the output grid dimensions in the prompting or post-processing steps to ensure consistency. For example, add a step to verify output grid dimensions based on inferred transformations.
*   **Verification and Validation:** Implement additional validation steps to verify intermediate results and completed grids. The LLM should be asked to justify its choices. This would include verifying that the transformations applied are consistent with the identified pattern and result in a logically valid output grid.
*   **Region Definition:** Experiment with different methods for region definitions - perhaps using coordinates or other explicit instructions.
*   **Enforce Output Generation:** Modify the prompt to *explicitly* demand the full transformed grid as the final answer. Add constraints to ensure the LLM outputs a numerical grid, even if it believes the transformation is already complete.
*   **Rule Extraction Focus:** Shift the focus from code generation to more robust rule extraction. Explicitly prompt the LLM to *describe* the transformation rule in detail *before* generating code.
*   **Separate Reasoning and Execution:** Separate the tasks of describing the transformation rules and applying them. One approach is to have the LLM output a set of transformation rules in a structured format (e.g., JSON), then use a deterministic function to apply these rules to the test grid.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach:** Implement a TDD-like workflow. Generate a proposed output, then compare to the gold standard using a similarity metric, and use this feedback to refine the code *automatically* rather than rely on LLM's reasoning each time.
*   **Introduce a "Completion" Condition:** Add a mechanism to detect when further iterations are unlikely to improve the result. If similarity score changes are below a threshold, force the final grid to be output.
*   **Symbolic Reasoning:** Explore incorporating symbolic reasoning techniques or external tools to help the LLM identify and represent the transformation rules more formally.
*   **Decomposition of Sub-Tasks:** Explicitly decompose the process of rule extraction, rule validation, and code implementation.
*   **Few-shot examples:** Investigate providing the model with more varied few-shot examples to improve the extraction of the transformation rules.
*   **Focus on JSON Formatting:** Implement a strict post-processing step that validates the JSON output and corrects common formatting errors (removing backticks, extra nesting, etc.). This is critical to at least have syntactically correct outputs so that they can be evaluated.
*   **Simplify the Transformation Task:** Rather than relying on the LLM to perform the entire grid completion at once, break the task down into smaller, more manageable steps. For instance, identify the type of transformation occurring (e.g., value replacement, pattern replication) and then apply specific functions to implement that transformation.
*   **Improve Template Identification and Encoding:** Investigate how to better identify and encode the template or pattern present in the training examples. This might involve using image processing techniques to extract visual features from the grids or using more sophisticated prompting strategies to guide the LLM's pattern recognition process.
*   **Consider a Hybrid Approach:** Explore combining the LLM with a more traditional algorithm. The LLM could be used to identify the transformation type or key parameters, while the algorithm handles the actual grid manipulation.
*   **Address Output Size Variability:** Explicitly handle cases where the output grid size is different from the input grid size. Provide specific instructions to the LLM on how to determine the output size based on the training examples.
*   **Focus on ensuring the correct output format.** Debug the `apply_transformation` function to explicitly construct and return a nested list. Implement rigorous type checking and data validation to catch formatting errors.
*   **Consider separating the LLM's analytical and application tasks.** Use the LLM to identify the transformation rules, but implement *explicit code* to perform the transformation on the grid. This will give more control over the output format.
*   **Explore data preprocessing techniques.** Investigate methods to simplify the grid representations or highlight relevant visual features to improve the LLM's ability to analyze the patterns.
*   **Explicit Dimension Handling:** Design the system to explicitly verify and enforce the output grid dimensions based on the input grids in the training examples. This could include pre-processing steps to extract the dimension, or post-processing steps to enforce it.
*   **Improve Pattern Generalization:** Implement a mechanism to explicitly encourage the LLM to focus on relationships *between* elements and regions in the input/output grids.
*   **Decompose Numerical Mapping:** Instead of letting the LLM directly predict numerical substitutions, force it to extract rules for *how* numbers change.
*   **Augment Training Examples:** Provide more varied training examples to force the LLM to generalize beyond memorization of specific grid layouts and number mappings. Intentionally create examples that have similar *rules* but different *appearances.*
*   **Explicit Spatial Reasoning:** Improve the prompts to encourage the LLM to explicitly describe spatial relationships. Use language that forces the LLM to define the location of the transformed elements relative to other elements or regions.
*   **Reinforce Spatial Reasoning:** Provide the LLM with more focused training examples that emphasize spatial relationships.
*   **Coordinate Transformation:** Consider more direct coordinate transformations to supplement the knowledge graph approach. If the model could recognize which coordinates change value, and how, the problem could be simplified.
*   **Iterative KG Refinement:** Implement a feedback loop where the LLM can iteratively refine the knowledge graph based on errors in the transformation.
*   **Focus on Debugging and Correctness:** Prioritize debugging the core logic responsible for grid manipulation and output generation.
*   **Robust Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate the input grid to ensure it contains only expected numerical values and has the correct dimensions.
*   **Null/None Handling:** Add explicit checks for `None` values *before* any numerical comparison or operation. Implement strategies to handle `None` values gracefully (e.g., default values, error messages, retries). Ensure proper initialization of all numerical variables.
*   **LLM Output Validation and Constraints:** Constrain the LLM to produce valid numerical outputs that conform to the grid's expected data type. Add validation checks to the LLM's output to ensure it can be safely used in subsequent processing steps. Implement fallback logic if the LLM returns invalid data.
*   **Implement Error Recovery:** Incorporate mechanisms to detect and recover from errors during the LLM-based transformation process.
*   **Prioritize LLM Access and Error Handling:** Verify LLM access and improve error handling within the `call_llm` function.
*   **Enhanced Feature Analysis:** The `analyze_visual_features` function needs significant improvement. Exploring more sophisticated feature extraction techniques and incorporating spatial reasoning capabilities.
*   **Refine Transformation Application:** Enhance the `apply_transformation` function to accurately apply the inferred transformations to the test input grid.
*   **Implement Robust Output Validation:** Implement a comprehensive validation step to check the dimensions, value ranges, and overall structure of the output grid. Reject invalid outputs and provide informative error messages for debugging.
*   **Implement a More Robust Rule Extraction Mechanism:** Develop a mechanism that can identify and formalize the transformation rules in a more abstract and general way. This could involve using a combination of symbolic reasoning and visual feature analysis.
*   **Focus on Spatial Relationships:** Emphasize the importance of spatial relationships between grid elements in the prompting strategy.
*   **Explore Different Model Architectures:** Evaluate the performance of other model architectures, such as those specifically designed for spatial reasoning or graph neural networks, which might be better suited for this task.
*   **Incorporate a More Fine-Grained Validation Process:** Implement a validation process that checks the individual steps of the transformation, rather than just the final result.
*   **Enhanced Example Descriptions:** Provide more structured information to the LLM, emphasizing key elements like grid dimensions and relationships between input and output.
*   **Transformation Validation:** Implement a more robust validation step for the transformation descriptions generated by the LLM.
*   **Reinforce Spatial Reasoning:** Modify the prompts to explicitly encourage spatial reasoning.
*   **Refine Output Formatting:** Implement stricter output format validation to ensure the LLM generates the grid in the exact required structure.
*   **Enhanced Feature Analysis:** Prompt the LLM to explicitly identify the *type* of transformation (e.g., "maximum value in a subgrid," "rotation," "reflection," "number replacement based on neighbor values") before attempting to describe it in detail.
*   **Targeted Examples:** Carefully select training examples that represent a wider variety of transformations and edge cases to improve pattern generalization.
*   **Code Generation Fine-Tuning:** Encourage the LLM to generate a *validated* code implementation of the transformation rules. Add instructions to test the code by running the training examples, and fix it if the output is incorrect.
*   **Explicit Spatial Reasoning:** If spatial relationships are involved, provide the LLM with explicit spatial reasoning tools, such as functions to calculate distances, identify neighbors, or perform rotations/reflections on grid elements.
*   **Improved Output Validation:** Implement a more robust validation function that can evaluate the *logic* of the transformation in the output grid, rather than just its format.
*   **Introduce Explicit Rule Extraction:** Focus on methods that first extract explicit transformation rules from the training examples and then apply those rules to the test input.
*   **Decompose the Transformation Process:** Decompose the transformation process into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, identifying specific regions or elements to transform, determining the transformation operation, and applying the operation.
*   **Increase Training Data Diversity:** Supplement the training data with more diverse examples that cover different grid dimensions, element distributions, and transformation patterns.
*   **Explore Hybrid Approaches:** Investigate hybrid approaches that combine the LLM's reasoning abilities with more traditional algorithms for pattern recognition and grid manipulation.
*   **Implement Validation Techniques:** Develop more robust validation techniques that can detect and correct errors in the transformed grid.
*   **Improve Pattern Recognition:** Enhance the `analyze_visual_features` function to better recognize and categorize different types of grid transformation patterns.
*   **Refine Transformation Descriptions:** Develop a more structured and precise language for describing grid transformations.
*   **Focus on Size and Dimensionality Reasoning:** Explicitly incorporate size and dimensionality reasoning into the transformation logic.
*   **Introduce Verification Mechanisms:** Implement more robust verification mechanisms to validate the transformation description before applying it to the test input.
*   **Fine-tune LLM Prompts:** Carefully refine the prompts used for `call_llm` to provide more context and guidance to the LLM.
*   **Implement a Dimension Inference Module:** Develop a module that explicitly infers the dimensions of the output grid based on the training examples before attempting value transformations.
*   **Train for positional reasoning**: It's not enough to know what values to change. The system must reason about *where* to change them.
*   **Rethink the LLM Agent Roles:** Re-evaluate the roles of the LLM agents.
*   **Incorporate Validation Steps:** Add validation steps to ensure the generated output grid adheres to patterns observed in the training examples, such as value distributions and dimension ratios.
*   **Consider a Hybrid Approach:** Explore a hybrid approach that combines LLM-based reasoning with traditional image processing techniques for feature extraction and pattern recognition.
*   **Focus on Rule Decomposition:** Explicitly decompose the transformation rule into smaller, more manageable sub-rules.
*   **Implement a More Structured Validation Process:** Develop a more rigorous validation process that checks for specific aspects of the transformation, such as element counts and row/column patterns.
*   **Explore Explicit Coordinate-Based Rules:** Shift the representation of rules to be more explicit about coordinates.
*   **Generate More Diverse Training Data:** Consider augmenting the training dataset with examples that cover a wider range of transformation types and complexities.
*   **Add unit tests:** Add unit tests for `transform_grid` function.
*   **Enhanced Rule Extraction:** Refine the `extract_transformation_rule` agent to focus explicitly on identifying the source locations of numbers to be replicated. Implement a mechanism to distinguish between "source" values and "filler" values.
*   **Value-Specific Propagation:** Modify the `refine_transformation_rule` and `apply_transformation` agents to ensure that the correct values are being propagated based on their source locations.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** Test a combination of explicit rule-based transformations (hard-coded logic for common patterns) with the LLM-based agents.
*   **Context Aware Prompting:** Change the prompting strategy to explicitly instruct agents to be aware of the grid context during transformations.
*   **Simplify Transformation Logic:** Start with very basic transformation patterns and gradually increase complexity.
*   **Output format:** The prompt needs to be much more specific to encourage the output to be a valid grid, not just a description of a grid.
    *   Implement a more robust method for pattern identification, potentially incorporating techniques like convolution filters or feature extraction methods to discern relevant features.
    *   Refine the agent's ability to accurately translate identified patterns into executable rules. This may require a more constrained rule representation or a more detailed decomposition of the transformation process.
    *   Test a wider range of strategies beyond simple rotation or reflection. Include strategies that involve propagation, scaling, or arithmetic operations on grid elements.
    *   Implement unit tests for each sub-module, especially focusing on the strategy application to isolate failure points. Focus on testing the correctness of the transformations separate from strategy selection.
*   **Refine prompting for element-wise transformations:** Modify the `analyze_visual_features` prompt to explicitly request an element-wise transformation rule. Focus on identifying how each cell should be modified based on its neighbors or its current value within the grid context.
*   **Ensure output grid size consistency:** Constrain the `apply_transformation` function to *always* produce an output grid with the *exact* same dimensions as the input grid. Implement a size check and padding/truncation as needed to enforce this.
*   **Explicitly describe cell relationships in prompts:** Instead of general visual feature analysis, prompt the LLM to specifically analyze how the value of a cell (and its surrounding cells) in the Input Grid affects the corresponding cell in the Output Grid.
*   **Incorporate a "reasoning trace" in the prompt:** Ask the LLM to provide a step-by-step explanation for how each cell in the test input grid is transformed. This can provide insights into the LLM's decision-making process and highlight where the reasoning goes wrong.
*   **Consider few-shot prompting with "before-and-after" cell examples:** Include in the prompt, specific examples of how individual cells (with their surrounding context) change from the Input Grid to the Output Grid.
*   **Verify the output grid's validity**: Implement a checker function to ensure that the output grid is a valid grid by verifying that it is a 2D array.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #1:
Iteration: 7
Accuracy: 0.33
Approach Summary: The script solves grid transformation problems by analyzing visual features and applying transformations described in terms of these features. It uses a chain-of-thought approach where the problem is decomposed into analyzing visual features and applying a transformation. The agent roles involved are an expert at analyzing visual features and an expert at applying transformations. The function `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process, calling `analyze_visual_features` to get a transformation description, verifying it, and then using `apply_transformation` to generate the output. `call_llm` interfaces with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves analyzing the grid, describing the transformation, verifying the description, and finally applying the transformation to generate the output grid.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #2:
Iteration: 10
Accuracy: 0.33
Approach Summary: The script solves grid transformation problems using a two-step LLM approach: first, `analyze_visual_features` analyzes the problem and generates a transformation description, which is then validated to ensure it's usable, and second, `apply_transformation` applies the described transformation to produce the output grid. The script uses chain-of-thought prompting with multi-example prompts to guide the LLM. Two agents are implicitly defined via system instructions: a visual feature analyzer and a transformation applier. The functions `solve_grid_transformation`, `analyze_visual_features`, `apply_transformation`, and `call_llm` are used sequentially to breakdown the grid problem, use an LLM to solve the problem, and return the solution. The overall workflow involves analyzing visual features, validating the analysis, applying the transformation based on the analysis, and returning the final transformed grid.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #3:
Iteration: 11
Accuracy: 0.33
Approach Summary: The script solves grid transformation problems by first analyzing visual features using an LLM, then applying the derived transformation. The problem is decomposed into `analyze_visual_features` and `apply_transformation`. There are two LLM agent roles: one for feature analysis and another for applying transformations.

*   `solve_grid_transformation`: Orchestrates the solution by calling `analyze_visual_features` and `apply_transformation`.
*   `analyze_visual_features`: Analyzes the problem and returns a transformation description. It uses `call_llm` to get the transformation description and a validation of the description.
*   `apply_transformation`: Applies the transformation from `analyze_visual_features` to the test grid using `call_llm`.
*   `call_llm`: Makes calls to the Gemini LLM, handling both prompts and system instructions.

The overall workflow involves analyzing the visual features of the input using an LLM, validating the LLM response, and then applying the described transformation to generate the output grid, again using an LLM.

            PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED VARIATIONS:
            

            EXPLOITATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the error patterns, targeted improvements, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. CRITICAL: Break down the problem into distinct reasoning steps before modifying code
            3. CRITICAL: Analyze the best scripts to identify which components are working well and which are failing. Focus your improvements on the weak points while preserving successful components.
            4. Maintain the core successful elements of the best approaches
            5. Consider how you can combine strengths from multiple top-performing approaches
            6. CRITICAL: Add EMBEDDED EXAMPLES to EVERY LLM prompt that illustrate:
               - Sample input that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            7. Focus on fixing specific issues identified in previous error analyses. Create an explicit HYPOTHESIS for each targeted improvement, as well as a way to verify if it's successful.
            8. Enhance chain-of-thought reasoning and verification steps. Verification steps should be added to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            9. Apply the key insights from ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS to enhance the approach
            10. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment

            IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
            Analyze why the top approaches succeeded where others failed. Identify the key differentiators and strengthen them further.

            SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT APPROACH:
            1. First, identify which specific function or component is underperforming based on error analysis
            2. Examine how error cases differ from successful cases
            3. For each identified weakness, implement a targeted enhancement
            4. Add additional verification steps around modified components
            5. Consider how components interact - ensure improvements don't break successful parts

            Consider enhancing the script with one or more of these patterns:
            - Repeated validation with feedback loops
            - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
            - Dynamic input-dependent routing
            - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
            - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
            - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
            - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLOITATION phase:
            - Build upon what's working well in the best approaches
            - Consider creative combinations of successful techniques from different scripts
            - Make TARGETED improvements to address specific error patterns
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply the knowledge from our accumulated learnings
            - Significantly enhance the script to address weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your improvements
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

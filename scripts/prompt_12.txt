    "question": "PASSAGE: In September 1190 Richard and Philip arrived in Sicily. After the death of King William II of Sicily his cousin Tancred had seized power and had been crowned early in 1190 as King Tancred of Sicily, although the legal heir was William's aunt Constance, wife of the new Emperor Henry VI. Tancred had imprisoned William's widow, Queen Joan, who was Richard's sister and did not give her the money she had inherited in William's will. When Richard arrived he demanded that his sister be released and given her inheritance; she was freed on 28 September, but without the inheritance. The presence of foreign troops also caused unrest: in October, the people of Messina revolted, demanding that the foreigners leave. Richard attacked Messina, capturing it on 4 October 1190. After looting and burning the city Richard established his base there, but this created tension between Richard and Philip Augustus. He remained there until Tancred finally agreed to sign a treaty on 4 March 1191. The treaty was signed by Richard, Philip, and Tancred. Its main terms were:\n\nQUESTION: King Tancred of Sicily seized power from who?",

There were 160 Abenakis, many of whom chose to flee rather than fight. At least 31 chose to fight, and most of them were killed.:80 Rale was killed in the opening moments of the battle, a leading chief was killed, and nearly two dozen women and children.:84 The Colonists had casualties of two militiamen and one Mohawk. Harmon destroyed the Abenaki farms, and those who had escaped were forced to abandon their village and move northward to the Abenaki village of St. Francis and Becancour, Quebec.:81 :123\n\nQUESTION: Who had more casualties, the Colonists or the Abenakis?",

    "question": "PASSAGE: Sydney has been a manufacturing city since the protectionist policies of the 1920s. By 1961 the industry accounted for 39% of all employment and by 1970 over 30% of all Australian manufacturing jobs were in Sydney. Its status has declined in more recent decades, making up 12.6% of employment in 2001 and 8.5% in 2011. Between 1970 and 1985 there was a loss of 180,000 manufacturing jobs. The city is still the largest manufacturing centre in Australia. Its manufacturing output of $21.7 billion in 2013 was greater than that of Melbourne with $18.9 billion. Observers have noted Sydneys focus on the domestic market and high-tech manufacturing as reasons for its resilience against the high Australian dollar of the early 2010s.\n\nQUESTION: Which city had a greater manufacturing outpoint in 2013, Sydney or Melbourne?",

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Implement more print statements:** Add more print statements, especially when numerical computations are performed, so that one can track how numerical data and question data is extracted and utilized by the AI system.",
  "Enhance Reasoning Chain for Temporal Questions:** When the question involves time-related calculations, force the system to explicitly state the start date, end date, and the steps used to calculate the time difference. This will allow for easier debugging.",
  "Implement Semantic Similarity Measures:** Utilize semantic similarity metrics (e.g., word embeddings, sentence embeddings) to compare the question with different parts of the passage. This will help the system identify the most relevant information and avoid focusing on irrelevant details.",
  "Refine Question Parsing:** Implement more sophisticated techniques for question parsing, including dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, and question type classification. This will enable the system to better understand the relationships between words and phrases in the question.",
  "Implement Date Parsing and Calculation:** Integrate a robust date parsing library to accurately extract date information from the passage. Then, use built-in date difference functions (e.g., from the `datetime` module in Python) to calculate the exact number of months between the dates.",
  "Add Unit Tests Focused on Time-Based Reasoning:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically designed to test the system's temporal reasoning capabilities, including questions that require calculating time differences in days, weeks, months, and years.",
  "Add Temporal Reasoning Module:** Implement a dedicated module for temporal reasoning that can handle date calculations, time intervals, and event ordering.",
  "Prompt Engineering:** Use prompt engineering to explicitly ask the LLM to extract all relevant numbers and their corresponding units and then perform the calculation. For example: \"Extract all numbers corresponding to the entities and their units. What arithmetic operations should be performed to arrive at the answer? Perform the calculation and give the final answer.\"",
  "Introduce Contrastive Learning:** Train the system using contrastive learning techniques, where it's presented with pairs of similar questions that require different answers. This will help the system learn to differentiate between subtle nuances in question wording.",
  "Answer type classification:** Before generating the final answer, classify the question based on the expected answer type (e.g., numerical, descriptive, boolean). Use this classification to guide the answer generation process. For example, if the expected answer type is numerical, prioritize extracting numbers and performing calculations."

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return solution_result["solution"]

        def extract_entities_with_verification(question, max_attempts=3):
            #Extract entities and verify their validity with feedback loop.
            system_instruction = "You are an expert at extracting and validating entities."

            for attempt in range(max_attempts):

                Extract key entities from this question. 
                Return a JSON object with the extracted entities.

                    2. No irrelevant entities are included
                    3. All entity values are correct

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

# DATASET-SPECIFIC LEARNINGS & EXPERIMENT LOG

This document tracks our evolving understanding and experimental findings related to the question answering task on the current dataset. It serves as a long-term memory to guide future research and development efforts.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **General:**
    *   The dataset consists of passages describing events (primarily American football games or political events), followed by questions about the details.
    *   Questions are fact-based, requiring information retrieval and processing directly from the passage. No external knowledge is needed.
    *   Questions often involve numerical reasoning (arithmetic, comparisons) and general knowledge application.
    *   Passages can be lengthy, requiring careful reading.
    *   Case sensitivity is observed.
    *   Questions often involve comparing or relating two or more pieces of information in the passage.
    *   Questions frequently ask for numerical information (quantities, dates, names), requiring precise extraction and comparison.
    *   Passages often present multiple entities or events; questions require distinguishing between them and relating correct information.
    *   Questions may require synthesizing information from multiple sentences or inferring from disparate facts.
    *   Many questions involve interpreting percentages or proportions, requiring correct identification of the base number.
    *   Questions often test the understanding of specific terminology within the passage's context.
    *   Questions often require understanding of sports game summaries, particularly football.
    *   Questions often involve numerical reasoning based on events within the passage (e.g., counting touchdowns, calculating yardage differences).
    *   Questions can be complex, requiring differentiation between types of scoring events and temporal reasoning.
    *   Questions often require extracting relevant dates from a passage and then calculating the difference between them. The wording is precise, requiring careful attention to specific events and timelines.
    *   Passages contain extraneous information; therefore, the agent must be able to identify and extract specific dates relevant to the question.

*   **Entity Relationship Extraction:**
    *   The dataset presents questions requiring identifying relationships between entities within a passage. The target relationship often involves actions (e.g., seizing power, causing casualties) and the entities involved (agent and target).
    *   Questions frequently require pinpointing the target/subject of an action, even when multiple related entities are mentioned in close proximity. This demands precise understanding of sentence structure and pronoun references. The model confuses the person who *preceded* the power seizure with the *victim* of the power seizure (e.g., confusing King William II of Sicily with Queen Joan).
    *   The passages are concise, but contain sufficient detail that incorrect attribution is easy.

*   **Date/Time Reasoning:**
    *   A recurring pattern is the need to calculate durations (years, months, days) based on dates or time spans mentioned in the passage. This requires precise arithmetic and attention to inclusivity/exclusivity.

*   **Explicit Information Retrieval:**
    *   The questions often require directly extracting and processing information explicitly stated in the passage, rather than making complex inferences.

*   **Numeric Answers:**
    *   Many questions seek numeric answers, making them easily verifiable but also sensitive to arithmetic errors.

*   **Question Structure:**
    *   All questions follow the format: `"PASSAGE:\n[passage text]\n\nQUESTION: [question text]"`.
    *   Many questions involve numerical reasoning and comparison (e.g., "How many yards longer...", "Which star has a smaller mass...").
    *   Some questions ask for specific entities (e.g., "Who caught the final touchdown...", "Who threw the second longest touchdown pass?").
    *   Questions frequently ask for numerical information (e.g., "How many...?", "How many yards...?").
    *   The system does not appear to know how to resolve "who" questions.

*   **Answer Structure:**
    *   Answers are typically short phrases, numbers, or names.

*   **Passage Structure:**
    *   Passages vary in content (sports summaries, scientific descriptions like astronomy, political events).
    *   Sports passages often involve more complex event tracking, which poses extraction challenges.
    *   Passages are dense with numbers, requiring precise parsing, especially in sports narratives.

*   **Domain Knowledge:**
    *   Basic sports terminology (football positions, scoring) is needed for sports-related examples.
    *   General reading comprehension is crucial.
    *   For demographic examples, basic understanding of fertility rates is needed.

*   **Question Types:**
    *   Entity Extraction: Identifying specific players or entities involved in events (e.g., identifying the subject of a power seizure).
    *   Numerical Comparison: Comparing numerical values (yards, scores, TFR, mass) to determine differences.
    *   Counting: Counting the number of occurrences of an event or entity.

*   **Reasoning Types:**
    *   Direct Extraction: Finding the answer directly stated in the passage.
    *   Simple Arithmetic: Performing basic calculations (addition, subtraction) using numbers from the passage.
    *   Logical Deduction: Combining information from different parts of the passage to arrive at the answer.

*   **Non-Obvious Patterns:**
    *   Chronological order of events is important. Time-related keywords (e.g., "final," "first," "later," "second") help narrow the search.

*   **Edge Cases/Complexities:**
    *   Passages with ambiguous or contradictory information.
    *   Questions requiring more complex arithmetic operations (e.g., multiplication, division).
    *   Questions with implicit rather than explicit answers, requiring deeper inference.
    *   Handling of units (yards, points, etc.) consistently.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Keyword-Based Retrieval:** Identify keywords from the question and search for those keywords in the passage.
*   **LLM-Based Extraction & Reasoning:** Use an LLM to directly answer the question based on the passage; prompting is key.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** Combine keyword retrieval with LLM reasoning.
*   **Question Decomposition:** Decompose the question into smaller sub-questions. Breaking down complex questions into smaller, more manageable extraction tasks improves accuracy.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT):** Breaking down complex questions into smaller steps (decomposition, information extraction, synthesis) improves interpretability. However, effectiveness is limited by the system's ability to accurately understand the question's intent and extract relevant numerical data.
*   **Zero-Shot Reasoning:** Directly ask the LLM to answer the question based on the passage, using a well-crafted prompt.
*   **Text Splitting:** If passages are too long, split them into smaller chunks. Be mindful of context loss.
*   **Focus on Answer Synthesis:** Prioritize improving the `synthesize_answer` function.
*   **Specialized Agents:** The use of specialized agents (question decomposer, information extraction expert, answer synthesis expert) allows for a modular approach. Individual role definitions for LLMs need definition.
*   **Sequential Workflow:** The sequential workflow (decompose, extract, synthesize) enforces a structured problem-solving approach.
*   **Question-Type Determination and Specialized Processing:** Determine the question type (numerical vs. general) and use specialized processing. Failure in question type determination renders the entire system useless.
*   **LLM-Driven Techniques with Verification:** Combining LLM-driven techniques with verification steps at each stage is a successful pattern. However, verification is inadequate for semantic errors that stem from misinterpreting the question. The verification step in `clarify_question` and `extract_information` functions, while present, is not consistently working as intended.
*   **Dynamic Approach Selection:** Adapting the strategy based on the type of question being asked proves important.
*   **Extraction of Relevant Information:** The system has a strength in extracting relevant information from the passage.
*   **Leveraging distinct agent roles:** Question decomposer, information extraction expert, answer synthesizer help specialize the tasks.
*   **Chain-of-thought for focusing information extraction:** Aids in focusing the information extraction process.
*   **Validating intermediate steps:** Decomposition and extraction likely contributes to the overall accuracy.
*   Providing examples in LLM prompts improves performance.
*   Explicitly prompting the LLM to show its work (intermediate calculations) helps in debugging.
*   **Self-Debate:** The self-debate strategy *attempts* to address potential errors. The agent tries to verify their answers. The agent recognizes the importance of calculation but isn't consistently accurate.
*   **Question Clarification & Focused Extraction:** The "Question Clarification & Focused Extraction" approach, while not perfect, demonstrates potential. Clarifying the question's intent before extraction *should* ideally improve precision.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **General Script Errors:**
    *   `NameError: name 'call_llm' is not defined`. This prevents any actual processing.
*   **Root Cause: Incorrect Question Type Determination:** The entire system fails because the `determine_question_type()` function consistently returns an error. This highlights that the question type determination module is a single point of failure.
*   **Temporal Reasoning Errors:** The primary failure mode involves incorrect calculation of the number of months between two dates mentioned in the passage. This indicates a deficiency in the system's temporal arithmetic capabilities.
*   **Answer Synthesis Failure:** Inability to synthesize a valid answer, even when the correct information is extracted.
    *   The system struggles to provide fully complete answers, especially when context, units, or modifiers from the original passage are needed.
*   **Sports narrative complexity:** Questions about sports narratives can induce errors because they require understanding of event order and accurate extraction of details.
*   **Validation sensitivity:** Validation checks can be overly strict.
*   **Information Extraction Failure:** Errors in information extraction contribute to failures in answer synthesis. Inaccurate or incomplete extracted information leads to incorrect final answers. The agent struggles to correctly extract relevant information from the passages when multiple dates are present, leading to confusion in the arithmetic step.
*   **Ambiguous Passages:** Passages with ambiguous or contradictory information can lead to incorrect answers.
*   **Missing Information:** If the answer cannot be found in the passage, this leads to a failure.
*   **Lack of Arithmetic Reasoning:** Inability to perform arithmetic operations, particularly simple addition.
*   **Potential for Masked Limitations:** High accuracy can mask the system's vulnerability to more complex reasoning.
*   **Numerical extraction errors:** Incorrectly identifying or extracting numerical values from the passage.
*   **Calculation errors:** Performing incorrect arithmetic operations on extracted numbers.
*   **Information extraction errors:** Failing to identify and extract the correct information to answer general questions.
*   **Synthesis errors:** Generating a response that is not a coherent or accurate answer to the question.
*   **Question type misclassification**: Incorrectly classifying a question as numerical or general.
*   **Unit Handling:** Lack of proper unit handling leads to incomplete or misinterpreted answers.
*   **Misinterpretation of Question Intent:** The system struggles to accurately interpret the nuances of the question.
*   **Incorrect Numerical Calculation:** The system makes errors in numerical calculations.
*   **Lack of Verification:** The system lacks a final answer verification step to check the reasonableness of the answer.
*   **Numerical Extraction in Dense Passages:** Difficulty in accurately extracting numerical values and associating them with the correct entities.
*   **Off-by-One Errors in Duration Calculation:** Consistently making off-by-one errors when calculating the duration between two dates or years.
    *   **Misinterpretation of Inclusion/Exclusion:** The agent sometimes struggles to correctly interpret whether the start and end dates/years should be included in the duration calculation.
*   **Incorrect Subject Identification:** The system fails to correctly identify the subject of an action. For example, in the question about King Tancred seizing power, the LLM incorrectly identifies "King William II of Sicily" instead of the correct answer, "Queen Joan." This indicates a weakness in parsing complex sentences and understanding the relationships between entities and actions.
*   **Proximity Bias:** The LLM seems to exhibit proximity bias, selecting entities mentioned closer to the action verb, even if they are not the correct subject.
*   **Lack of "Who" Question Understanding:** The system does not appear to know how to resolve "who" questions.

    *   **Finding:** The successful implementation of the dynamic approach selection emphasizes the importance of adapting the strategy based on the type of question being asked.
    *   **Caveat:** The lack of error cases makes it impossible to determine the system's limitations definitively.
*   **ITERATION 3:**
    *   **Goal:** Improve performance, leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for question decomposition.
    *   **Finding:** CoT is a beneficial approach for this type of question answering task.
    *   **Finding:** A significant limitation is the system's lack of arithmetic reasoning capabilities.
    *   **Finding:** The individual role definitions for the LLMs (question decomposer, information extractor, answer synthesizer) needs more definition.

    *   **Accuracy:** 1.0
    *   **Goal:** Improve answer completeness, focusing on context, units, and modifiers.
    *   **Finding:** Achieving 1.0 accuracy suggests that the overall strategy of chain-of-thought, role-based agents, and validation is effective.
    *   **Finding:** The primary area for improvement is in the completeness and context of the final answer.
*   **ITERATION 5:**
    *   **Goal:** Improve semantic understanding and numerical reasoning capabilities.

    *   **Finding:** The chain-of-thought approach with question decomposition, information extraction, and answer synthesis showed promise.
    *   **Finding:** Providing examples in LLM prompts seems to improve performance.
    *   **Finding:** Explicitly prompting the LLM to show its work (intermediate calculations) helped in debugging.
    *   **Finding:** Inconsistent and unreliable arithmetic calculations are a major failure mode.
    *   **Finding:** The LLM sometimes fails to correctly interpret or apply units.
    *   **Finding:** The system lacks a final answer verification step to check the reasonableness of the answer.
    *   **Finding:** Arithmetic and unit errors indicate a need for more robust numerical reasoning capabilities.
*   **ITERATION 7:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.0
    *   **Goal:** Improve semantic understanding and numerical reasoning capabilities.
    *   **Finding:** This iteration provided no usable data due to the undefined `call_llm` function.
    *   **Finding:** The script is fundamentally broken without the `call_llm` function.
*   **ITERATION 8:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.0
    *   **Goal:** Improve semantic understanding and numerical reasoning capabilities.
    *   **Finding:** The `determine_question_type()` function consistently failed, leading to a complete system failure.
    *   **Finding:** The question type determination module is a single point of failure.
*   **ITERATION 9:**
    *   **Goal:** Improve handling of date/time reasoning, specifically duration calculations.
    *   **Finding:** The "Reading Comprehension Expert" agent with self-debate, in its current form, is not robust enough to prevent common arithmetic errors, especially off-by-one errors in duration calculation.
    *   **Finding:** The agent's general reasoning capabilities are insufficient for accurate duration calculations.
    *   **Finding:** Self-Debate Alone Is Insufficient: The agent identifies the potential for errors but fails to consistently avoid them.
*   **ITERATION 10:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.80
    *   **Goal:** Improve handling of date/time reasoning with a "Holistic Reading & Arithmetic Reasoner".
    *   **Finding:** The approach demonstrates a significant weakness in accurately calculating time differences, even when the relevant dates are explicitly provided.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that a holistic approach would avoid decomposition errors is not fully supported. The approach correctly handles some form of reading comprehension and extraction but fails during a specific arithmetic operation.
*   **2025-05-17 20:26:38: SCRIPT ERROR**
    *   Error detected during script repair (attempt 1): ERROR: Script requires external information to provide an answer.
*   **2025-05-17 20:26:49: SCRIPT ERROR**
    *   Error detected during script repair (attempt 2): ERROR: No passage provided.
*   **ITERATION 11:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.80
    *   **Goal:** Improve accuracy by clarifying the question's intent before information extraction.
    *   **Finding:** The "Question Clarification & Focused Extraction" approach, with a verification step, achieves an accuracy of 0.80. This is a baseline and needs improvement.
    *   **Finding:** The primary hypothesis – that clarifying the question intent improves extraction precision – remains unproven. The accuracy gain may be due to other factors or require further refinement of the clarification prompts.
    *   **Finding:** Clarifying the question isn't enough; the extraction phase needs to be more robust to identifying the correct entity related to a specific action.
    *   **Failure Example:** Incorrect subject identification. For example, in the question about King Tancred seizing power, the LLM incorrectly identifies "King William II of Sicily" instead of the correct answer, "Queen Joan." This indicates a weakness in parsing complex sentences and understanding the relationships between entities and actions. The model confuses the person who *preceded* the power seizure with the *victim* of the power seizure.
    *   **Finding:** The LLM seems to exhibit proximity bias, selecting entities mentioned closer to the action verb, even if they are not the correct subject.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Define or import `call_llm` immediately.**
*   **After fixing the `call_llm` issue, re-run the experiment to gather meaningful data.**

*   **Post-processing for completeness:** Explore post-processing steps to check for missing information (e.g., units, quantities).
*   **Arithmetic Reasoning Module:** Integrate a dedicated arithmetic reasoning module into the answer synthesis step.
*   **Refine Answer Synthesis Prompt:** Refine the prompt for the answer synthesis LLM to explicitly instruct it to perform calculations when necessary and provide the answer in the expected format.
*   **Include Examples of Arithmetic Reasoning in Prompts:** Add examples to the prompts for all LLM calls that explicitly show how to extract numbers and perform calculations.
*   **Evaluate Different LLMs for Numerical Reasoning:** Evaluate different LLMs that are known to have better numerical reasoning capabilities.
*   **Answer Synthesis Improvement:** Debug and improve the `synthesize_answer` function.
*   **Refine Validation Logic:** Review the validation checks to ensure they are not overly strict.
*   **Evaluate Information Extraction Success:** Assess how frequently information extraction fails.
*   **Dataset Split & Analysis:** Split the dataset by passage type.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Experiment with different prompt formulations.
*   **Context Window Management:** Implement strategies for handling long passages.
*   **Error Analysis:** Manually analyze failed examples to identify the root cause of the errors.
*   **External Knowledge Integration:** Investigate the use of external knowledge sources to augment the information provided in the passage.

*   **Formalize Inclusion/Exclusion Reasoning:** Explicitly represent the concept of inclusion/exclusion of start and end dates in the reasoning process.
*   **Introduce Unit Tests:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically focused on testing the date/time arithmetic functions.
*   **Verification specifically for temporal calculations:** Given the observed failure mode, implement a specific verification step focused on validating the temporal calculation.
    *   This could involve cross-checking the calculated difference with the passage or using an external calculator.
*   **Analyze successes:** Investigate the questions that were answered correctly to understand which aspects of the holistic approach are effective. Use this information to strengthen the successful components of the system.
*   **Refine Extraction Prompts:** Modify the `extract_information` prompt to explicitly instruct the LLM to focus on identifying the *subject* of the action described in the question, not just any related entity. Include examples of correct and incorrect subject identification.
*   **Add Subject-Verb-Object Triplet Identification:** Incorporate a step to identify subject-verb-object triplets in the passage, focusing on the verbs related to the question. This can help the model explicitly reason about the agent and target of the action.
*   **Improve Clarification of "Who" questions:** Explicitly instruct the LLM that "who" questions must be answered with the name of a person.
*   **Implement a "reasoning chain"**: Provide the model with space to include steps justifying its conclusion; this could improve the ability to verify the result.
*   **Add more error examples**: The error examples provided to the model are very scarce, so they are not helpful.

            TOP PERFORMING APPROACHES TO BUILD UPON:
            
TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #1:
Iteration: 1
Accuracy: 1.00
Approach Summary: The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with question decomposition and verification steps to answer a question. The problem is decomposed into sub-questions, then relevant information is extracted, and finally, an answer is synthesized. Three agent roles are used: question decomposer, information extraction expert, and answer synthesis expert, each implemented through specific prompts to the LLM. The functions used are `main` which orchestrates the process, `decompose_question` which breaks down the question, `extract_information` which gathers relevant information, `synthesize_answer` which formulates the final answer, and `call_llm` which interfaces with the Gemini API; these functions are called sequentially to solve the problem. The overall workflow is to decompose, extract, and synthesize, with validation steps at each stage to ensure correctness.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #2:
Iteration: 2
Accuracy: 1.00
Approach Summary: The script addresses question answering by first determining the question type and then processing it accordingly. Numerical questions are processed by extracting numerical information and calculating the answer, while general questions are addressed through question decomposition, information extraction, and answer synthesis. The agent roles are: question type identifier, numerical information extractor, calculator, question decomposer, information extraction expert, and answer synthesis expert. Key functions include `determine_question_type`, `process_numerical_question`, `extract_numerical_info`, `calculate_answer`, `process_general_question`, `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, `synthesize_answer`, and `call_llm`; these functions are chained together to process the question and generate an answer using LLM-driven techniques with verification steps at each stage. The overall workflow involves determining question type, processing the question using a type-specific method, and returning the result or an error message.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #3:
Iteration: 4
Accuracy: 1.00
Approach Summary: The script uses a chain-of-thought approach, decomposing a question into sub-questions, extracting information, and then synthesizing an answer. It employs three distinct agent roles: a question decomposer, an information extraction expert, and an answer synthesis expert. It leverages the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model using specifically crafted prompts for each agent, and incorporates validation steps after each stage to ensure correctness. The script begins with the `main` function, which orchestrates the calls to `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, and `synthesize_answer`; these functions in turn use `call_llm` to generate responses which undergo validation at each step.

            PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED VARIATIONS:
            

            EXPLOITATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the error patterns, targeted improvements, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. CRITICAL: Break down the problem into distinct reasoning steps before modifying code
            3. CRITICAL: Analyze the best scripts to identify which components are working well and which are failing. Focus your improvements on the weak points while preserving successful components.
            4. Maintain the core successful elements of the best approaches
            5. Consider how you can combine strengths from multiple top-performing approaches
            6. CRITICAL: Add EMBEDDED EXAMPLES to EVERY LLM prompt that illustrate:
               - Sample input that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            7. Focus on fixing specific issues identified in previous error analyses. Create an explicit HYPOTHESIS for each targeted improvement, as well as a way to verify if it's successful.
            8. Enhance chain-of-thought reasoning and verification steps. Verification steps should be added to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            9. Apply the key insights from ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS to enhance the approach
            10. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment

            IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
            Analyze why the top approaches succeeded where others failed. Identify the key differentiators and strengthen them further.

            SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT APPROACH:
            1. First, identify which specific function or component is underperforming based on error analysis
            2. Examine how error cases differ from successful cases
            3. For each identified weakness, implement a targeted enhancement
            4. Add additional verification steps around modified components
            5. Consider how components interact - ensure improvements don't break successful parts

            Consider enhancing the script with one or more of these patterns:
            - Repeated validation with feedback loops
            - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
            - Dynamic input-dependent routing
            - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
            - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
            - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
            - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLOITATION phase:
            - Build upon what's working well in the best approaches
            - Consider creative combinations of successful techniques from different scripts
            - Make TARGETED improvements to address specific error patterns
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply the knowledge from our accumulated learnings
            - Significantly enhance the script to address weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your improvements
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

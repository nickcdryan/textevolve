    APPROACH SUMMARY:
    The script solves grid transformation problems using a multi-stage LLM pipeline. It decomposes the problem into extracting training grids and the input grid, inferring the transformation rule using a "pattern expert" agent, applying the rule to the input grid using a "transformation expert" agent, and verifying the resulting grid using a "verification expert" agent. The `call_llm` function interacts with the Gemini LLM. The `extract_grid` function is used to extract the input grid from the question, and `main` orchestrates the entire process, calling `call_llm` to infer rules, apply transformations, and verify results. The overall workflow involves extracting relevant grids, inferring transformation rules, applying them, and verifying the output to ensure a correct transformation.

    TRACE INSIGHTS:
    ## EXECUTION PATTERN ANALYSIS

The primary failure pattern is that the LLM struggles to consistently and correctly apply the inferred transformation rules to the input grids. This is evidenced by the "Verification failed" errors in all three incorrect samples. The `extract_grid` function seems to be working correctly, but the LLM's reasoning, application, and verification stages are inconsistent. There is evidence that the system is correctly identifying the transformations in the training examples but then failing to apply that transformation correctly in the evaluation case based on a novel input grid.

## SUCCESS FACTORS

The initial grid extraction using `extract_grid` appears to be successful in the provided traces. The LLM is capable of identifying patterns in the training examples. It is also capable of expressing those rules in a human-readable form. However, the critical issue is consistently and accurately applying the rule to transform the new input grid.

## FAILURE POINTS

1.  **Incorrect Sample 0:** The LLM correctly infers the transformation rule (removing the fourth column and summing rows). However, it then fails to correctly apply the rule in the application step. In the verification step, the transformed grid `[[2, 2, 2]]` clearly does *not* match the correct transformation for the input grid `[[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]]`.

2.  **Incorrect Sample 1:** The LLM infers a complex transformation rule (repeating pattern from non-zero elements). The LLM fails to follow through with the reasoning it stated. This leads to an incorrect transformed grid. The verification step detects the mismatch.

3.  **Incorrect Sample 2:** The LLM infers a "push-down" operation but incorrectly applies it to the input grid, which leads to a different outcome than what was anticipated. The LLM states that it correctly found the answer, which suggests a failure to reason about the answer.

The core problem lies in the LLM's ability to consistently and accurately apply the inferred transformation rule.

## CODE-LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  **Refactor `main` to provide more context to the LLM.** Specifically, include the input grid, transformation rule, and transformed grid in the verification prompt. This allows the LLM to compare these elements directly and catch discrepancies.

2.  **No changes to `extract_grid` function needed** based on the traces.

## PROMPT ENGINEERING RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  **Refine the "Transformation Rule" identification prompt:**

    *   **Include a "Think Step by Step" instruction.** This encourages the LLM to break down the transformation into smaller, more manageable steps.
    *   **Prompt for an example application of the rule to the first training example.** This forces the LLM to demonstrate its understanding of the rule.

    ```python
    def main(question):
        # ... (existing code) ...

        rule_prompt = f"""
            You are an expert at identifying patterns in grid transformations.

            Here are examples of grid transformations:
            {example1_text}
            {example2_text if example2_text else ""}

            Think step by step. What is the transformation rule that converts the Input Grid to the Output Grid?
            Also, show exactly how to apply the rule to the Input Grid from {example1_label}.

            Respond with the transformation rule and an example of its application.
        """
        transformation_rule_text = call_llm(rule_prompt)

        # ... (rest of the code) ...
    ```

2.  **Improve the "Apply Transformation Rule" prompt:**

    *   **Reiterate the "Think Step by Step" instruction.** This reinforces the need for a methodical approach.
    *   **Request the LLM to explicitly state each step of the transformation.**

    ```python
    def main(question):
        # ... (existing code) ...

        application_prompt = f"""
            You are an expert at applying grid transformation rules.
            Transformation Rule: {transformation_rule_text}

            Input Grid:
            {input_grid_text}

            Think step by step. Apply the transformation rule to the Input Grid.
            Explicitly state each step of the transformation.
        """
        transformed_grid_text = call_llm(application_prompt)

        # ... (rest of the code) ...
    ```

3.  **Strengthen the "Verification" prompt:**

    *   **Provide the original question, input grid, transformation rule, and the transformed grid.**
    *   **Ask the LLM to explicitly justify whether the transformed grid correctly implements the transformation rule on the input grid.**
    *   **Prompt to output "VALID" or "INVALID" only.**

    ```python
    def main(question):
        # ... (existing code) ...

        verification_prompt = f"""
            You are a meticulous grid transformation verifier.
            Question: {question}

            Input Grid: {input_grid_text}
            Transformation Rule: {transformation_rule_text}
            Transformed Grid: {transformed_grid_text}

            Does the Transformed Grid correctly implement the Transformation Rule on the Input Grid?
            Justify your answer step by step.

            Respond with either "VALID" or "INVALID" only.
        """
        verification_result = call_llm(verification_prompt)

        # ... (rest of the code) ...
    ```

## HIGH LEVEL INSIGHTS

The system needs to be more methodical in its reasoning and application of the transformation rules. The current approach relies too heavily on the LLM's ability to implicitly perform the transformation correctly. By explicitly prompting the LLM to break down the transformation into steps and justify its reasoning, we can improve the accuracy and reliability of the system. The key is to make the transformation process more transparent and verifiable. The system would also benefit from a more sophisticated error handling mechanism that can detect and recover from failures. By making the verification step more robust, we can catch errors before they propagate further down the pipeline.

The updated prompts aim to make the LLM more explicit about its reasoning process, which should lead to more accurate and reliable results. By emphasizing step-by-step thinking and explicit justification, we can improve the system's ability to solve these grid transformation problems.


    ERROR ANALYSIS:
    ## RUNTIME ERRORS
*   **Sample 0:** "Error: Verification failed. The grid does not match transformation rule" - This indicates a failure in the `solution_verification` capability. No explicit runtime error is present, but the logic within the verification is faulty.
*   **Sample 1:** "Error: Verification failed. The grid does not match transformation rule" - Similar to sample 0, indicates a `solution_verification` failure. This output contains the string values rather than numerical values.
*   **Sample 2:** No explicit runtime error, but the system provides an incomplete grid. This can be considered an implicit runtime error stemming from the system's inability to properly produce the correct format for the grid.

## STRENGTHS

1.  **Column Removal (Sample 0):** The system correctly identified a pattern of removing the fourth column consisting only of 5s.
2.  **JSON Output (Sample 1):** The system attempts to provide detailed information in a structured JSON format, including the original grid, transformed grid, and other potentially relevant information. Even though the JSON contains errors (string vs int) the fact it's generating the JSON itself is a strength
3.  **Error Detection (All Samples):** The system correctly identifies that its generated output does not match the expected transformation rule, indicating a functional error detection mechanism.

## WEAKNESSES

1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to accurately identify complex patterns in the input/output grid transformations. It oversimplifies the rules, leading to incorrect transformations.
2.  **Data Type Handling:** Sample 1 shows inconsistencies in data type handling, with the transformed grid containing strings instead of integers.
3.  **Output Format:** Sample 2 generates an incomplete grid, showcasing inconsistencies in output format.

## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS

1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system's primary bottleneck is its inability to accurately recognize and apply the underlying transformation patterns present in the training examples. The system is failing in `information_extraction` and then as a result failing at `solution_generation`.
2.  **Solution Verification:** The verification step identifies discrepancies, but the system's reasoning for correcting the solution is flawed (Sample 0).

## ERROR PATTERNS

*   **Incorrect Transformations:** The system consistently fails to generate the correct transformed grid, indicating a failure in understanding the transformation rule.
*   **Verification Failures:** The verification mechanism identifies errors but fails to trigger a correct solution generation. This is a symptom of the underlying pattern recognition problem.

## PRIMARY ISSUE

The most critical problem is the system's inability to learn and accurately apply transformation rules based on the provided training examples. This stems from a weak `information_extraction` capability, hindering its ability to then perform `solution_generation`.

## IMPROVEMENT AREAS

1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's ability to identify and generalize patterns from the training examples.
2.  **Solution Verification:** Enhance the verification mechanism to not only identify errors but also guide the solution generation process toward a correct output.
3.  **Data Type Handling:** Ensure consistent data type handling throughout the transformation process.

## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS

1.  **Enhanced Pattern Recognition Algorithms:** Implement more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks) that can effectively learn from the grid data.
2.  **Debugging and logging:** Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong
3.  **Constraint-Based Reasoning:** Integrate constraint-based reasoning techniques to ensure that generated solutions adhere to the identified patterns.
4.  **Data Type Validation:** Add explicit data type validation steps to ensure that all grid values are integers.
5.  **Test Case Variety:** Increase the variety and complexity of test cases to expose and address potential weaknesses in the system's reasoning and transformation logic.

## CAPABILITY MAPPING

*   **Sample 0:**
    *   `information_extraction`: Failed to correctly extract the transformation rule.
    *   `solution_generation`: Generated an incorrect solution.
    *   `solution_verification`: Identified an error but failed to correct it.
*   **Sample 1:**
    *   `information_extraction`: Failed to correctly extract the transformation rule.
    *   `solution_generation`: Generated an incorrect solution with data type inconsistencies.
    *   `solution_verification`: Identified an error.
*   **Sample 2:**
    *   `information_extraction`: Failed to correctly extract the transformation rule.
    *   `solution_generation`: Generated an incomplete solution.

MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        valid_solutions = []
        for reasoning in reasoning_paths:

        {problem}

        Approach 1:
        {reasoning_1}

        Approach 2:
        {reasoning_2}

        Approach 3:

        - Consider keeping only reasoning paths that arrive at a consistent answer
        - The final decision can use majority voting or weighted evaluation of reasoning quality
        - This pattern is especially effective for problems with multiple valid solution paths
        - You can filter reasoning paths before the final decision based on consistency with examples
        - For critical applications, add verification to each reasoning path

           {problem}

           Make this approach different from typical solutions by [diversity instruction].
           ```

        2. Test each solution against examples:
           ```
           Check if this solution works for this test case:

           Solution: {solution}
           Test case: {test_case}

           Verify if the solution produces the correct result.
           ```

        3. Select the best solution based on performance:
           ```
           Compare these solutions based on [criteria].
           Which solution best addresses the problem?
           ```

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Force diversity in generation through specific instructions
        - Use different test cases to evaluate different aspects
        - Consider combining elements from multiple solutions
        - Customize evaluation criteria to match what matters most

        Action N: Finish[[final answer]]

        Problem: {problem}

        Thought 1:

        - A clear description
        - Why it's significant

        - Text analysis: themes, entities, sentiment, structure
        - Visual puzzles: shapes, positions, colors, transformations
        - Math problems: equations, constraints, variables, relationships
        - Logic puzzles: rules, constraints, entities, relationships

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Customize feature types based on your specific domain
        - Provide examples of good feature extraction
        - Consider different levels of abstraction
        - Features should simplify downstream processing
        


        # Pattern Identification Template

        ## Example Prompt Structure
        ```
        Examine these examples and identify all underlying patterns:

        Examples:
        [Example 1]
        [Example 2]
        [Example 3]

        For each pattern you identify:
        1. Describe the pattern precisely
        2. Show how it applies to the examples
        3. Explain how this pattern could be used

        Consider these types of patterns:

        - [Pattern type 3 relevant to domain]
        ```

        ## Pattern Types to Consider:
        - Spatial: position, size, symmetry, rotation, reflection
        - Transformation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, inversion
        - Sequence: repetition, alternation, progression, recursion
        - Visual: color, shape, size, orientation, grouping
        - Logical: conditionals, conjunctions, disjunctions, implications
        - Linguistic: syntax, semantics, structure, style, tone
        - Algorithmic: loops, conditionals, recursion, iteration
        - Psychological: motivation, emotion, belief, perception, cognition
        - Knowledge: facts, definitions, relationships, hierarchies, taxonomies
        - Structural: composition, decomposition, hierarchy, network, graph
        - Relational: cause, effect, correlation, comparison, contrast
        - Unknown: patterns that are not immediately obvious or familiar

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Encourage identification of multiple patterns
        - Ask for concrete examples of each pattern
        - Consider having the LLM rank pattern likelihood
        - Test identified patterns before applying them
        


        # Wait Injection Pattern

        ## Example Structure
        1. Get initial reasoning:
           ```
           Solve this problem step by step:
           {problem}
           ```

        2. Inject wait and reconsideration:
           ```
           Solve this problem step by step:
           {problem}

           {initial_reasoning_part}
           ...wait... let me reconsider this...

           [Reconsideration instruction]
           ```

        ## Reconsideration Instructions:
        - "Are there assumptions I made that might not be valid?"
        - "Is there a simpler approach I overlooked?"
        - "Let me check my logic carefully on the previous steps"
        - "Let me consider this problem from a different angle"

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Timing is critical - inject wait during critical reasoning
        - Customize reconsideration prompts to address common pitfalls
        - Experiment with multiple wait points for complex problems
        - Can be combined with perspective switching
        - "...wait..." token injection shown to trigger re-evaluation in LLMs
        


        # Hypothesis Testing Pattern

        ## Example Structure
        1. Generate multiple hypotheses:
           ```
           Generate {n} different hypotheses about the pattern in this problem:
           {problem}

           For each hypothesis:
           - State what the pattern might be
           - Explain your reasoning
           - Predict how it would apply to new examples
           ```

        2. Test each hypothesis against examples:
           ```
           Test these hypotheses:
           [List of hypotheses]

           Against these examples:
           [List of examples]

           For each hypothesis and example:
           - Apply the hypothesis
           - Check if the result matches the expected output
           - Note any discrepancies
           ```

        3. Refine based on results:
           ```
           Based on the testing results, refine the most promising hypothesis:
           [Testing results]

           Create an improved hypothesis that addresses any failures.
           ```

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Generate diverse hypotheses, not minor variations
        - Use examples that can distinguish between hypotheses
        - Consider combining elements from multiple hypotheses
        - Explicit refinement steps are critical for improvement

        # Dynamic Memory Pattern

        ## Example Implementation Structure
        ```python
        # Initialize memory buffer
        memory_buffer = []

        # Generate initial candidate solutions
        initial_prompt = f'''
        Solve this problem with step-by-step reasoning:

        {problem}
        '''

                Provide an improved solution addressing the issues.
                '''

        '''

        final_solution = generate_solution(synthesis_prompt, temperature=0.3)
        ```

        ## Implementation Notes
        - The memory buffer stores solution attempts, evaluations, and metadata
        - Solution refinement is guided by accumulated feedback
        - Memory creates continuity across iteration cycles

        - Can add filtering to maintain diversity in the memory buffer
        - Memory can persist across different problems to build general knowledge
        - Consider memory management strategies for large buffers

           [Defense/refinement]

           Provide an improved solution that incorporates valid points from both sides.
           ```

        # Comprehensive Verification Pattern

        ## Example Structure
        1. Perform multiple verification methods:
           - Logical consistency check
           - Test case verification
           - Alternative approach comparison
           - Edge case analysis

        2. Example logical check:
           ```
           Verify if this solution is logically consistent:
           {solution}

           Check for:
           - Internal contradictions
           - Unwarranted assumptions
           - Logical fallacies
           ```

        3. Example test case check:
           ```
           Apply this solution to this test case:

           Solution: {solution}
           Test case: {test_case}

           Does it produce the expected result?
           ```

        4. Create verification summary:
           ```
           Based on all verification results:
           [Verification results]

           Is the solution verified? If not, what specific issues need to be addressed?
           ```

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Customize verification methods to your domain
        - Always include feedback for failed verification
        - Consider confidence weighting for different methods
        - Include both syntactic and semantic verification
        


        # Self-Consistency Checking Pattern

        ## Example Structure
        1. Generate multiple independent solutions:
           ```
           Solve this problem:
           {problem}

           Provide a complete solution with your reasoning.
           ```

           (Repeat for multiple solutions)

        2. Extract answers from solutions:
           ```
           Extract the final answer from your solution.
           ```

        3. Check consistency across answers:
           ```
           Analyze these different answers to the same problem:
           [List of answers]

           Are they consistent? If not, which is most likely correct and why?
           ```

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Use different prompting for each solution attempt
        - Consider majority voting for consistent answers
        - For inconsistent results, analyze reasoning paths
        - Can be combined with verification of each solution
        


        # Pattern Combination Guide

        Patterns can and should be combined for complex tasks. Here are effective combinations:

        ## Verification + Generation Patterns
        - Apply verification to any generation pattern
        - Use feedback from verification to guide regeneration
        - Example: Few-shot learning with verification feedback loop

        ## Multi-Perspective + Debate
        - Generate perspectives from different experts
        - Have experts debate their approaches
        - Synthesize the best elements from the debate

        ## ReAct + Verification
        - Verify each action before proceeding
        - Use verification feedback to guide next actions
        - Add reflection steps between actions

        ## Chain of Thought + Wait Injection
        - Insert wait points during complex reasoning steps
        - Use wait points to reconsider assumptions
        - Continue chain of thought after reconsideration

        ## Data Analysis + Hypothesis Testing
        - Use data analysis to generate initial hypotheses
        - Test hypotheses systematically
        - Refine based on test results

        ## Creative Combinations
        Don't limit yourself to these suggestions! Experiment with novel combinations:
        - Start with data analysis, use expert panel to interpret, debate approaches, implement with ReAct
        - Generate hypotheses, verify with self-consistency, refine with expert feedback
        - Extract features, perform multi-perspective analysis, implement with verification loops

        The key is to match pattern combinations to the specific challenges of your task.
        


        # Pattern Adaptation Guide

        These patterns are starting points, not rigid prescriptions. Here's how to adapt them:

        ## Prompt Engineering
        - Adjust detail level based on task complexity
        - Modify tone and style to fit domain context
        - Add domain-specific terminology and concepts
        - Customize examples to match your specific task

        ## Function Logic
        - Simplify patterns for straightforward tasks
        - Expand patterns for complex reasoning
        - Modify verification criteria based on importance
        - Adjust number of iterations or perspectives based on needs

        ## Implementation Variants
        - Text-only implementations for pure LLM interaction
        - Hybrid implementations that combine LLM with code logic
        - Multi-stage pipelines that apply different patterns sequentially
        - Parallel implementations that generate multiple approaches

        ## Key Questions for Adaptation
        1. What's unique about my specific task?
        2. Which parts of the pattern are most relevant?
        3. What additional steps or checks are needed?
        4. How can I make the pattern more efficient for my context?

        Remember: These patterns are tools to be wielded creatively, not constraints!
        


        # Example: Adapting and Combining Patterns

        ## Original Task
        Solving grid pattern problems by identifying abstract transformation rules.

        ## Pattern Selection and Adaptation

        1. Start with Data Analyzer to understand grid structure:
        ```python
        # Customize the Data Analyzer pattern for grid analysis
        grid_analysis_prompt = f'''
        Analyze these grid transformation examples:
        {examples}

        Focus specifically on:
        - Spatial relationships in the grid
        - Transformation rules between input and output
        - Pattern constraints and edge cases
        - Potential algorithms for transformation
        '''

        analysis = call_llm(grid_analysis_prompt)
        ```

        2. Apply Pattern Identification with domain customization:
        ```python
        # Adapt the Pattern Identification template for grid transformations
        pattern_prompt = f'''
        Identify transformation patterns in these grid examples:
        {examples}

        For each example, analyze these aspects:
        - Cell-to-cell transformations
        - Row/column operations
        - Shape preservation or alteration
        - Color or value changes
        - Positional shifts or rotations

        Describe each pattern precisely and show how it applies.
        '''

        patterns = call_llm(pattern_prompt)
        ```

        3. Combine with Hypothesis Testing:
        ```python
        # Generate hypotheses about transformation rules
        hypothesis_prompt = f'''
        Based on these identified patterns:
        {patterns}

        Generate 3 different hypotheses about the transformation rules.
        For each hypothesis:
        - Clearly state the transformation rule
        - Explain how it works on each example
        - Predict what would happen with different inputs
        '''

        hypotheses = call_llm(hypothesis_prompt)

        # Test each hypothesis
        for hypothesis in parse_hypotheses(hypotheses):
            verification_prompt = f'''
            Test this hypothesis against all examples:
            {hypothesis}

            Examples:
            {examples}

            For each example, show whether the hypothesis:
            - Correctly predicts the transformation
            - Fails to explain some aspect
            - Needs refinement (and how)
            '''

            verification = call_llm(verification_prompt)
            hypothesis_results.append(verification)
        ```

        4. Add Verification with Feedback Loop:
        ```python
        # Apply best hypothesis to new problem with verification
        for attempt in range(max_attempts):
            solution = apply_best_hypothesis(new_problem, best_hypothesis)

            verification_prompt = f'''
            Verify this solution:
            {solution}

            Check:
            - Does it follow the established transformation rule?
            - Are there any errors in application?
            - Is the output grid format correct?

            Return specific feedback on any issues.
            '''

            verification = call_llm(verification_prompt)

            if is_valid(verification):
                return solution

            # Refine with feedback
            refinement_prompt = f'''
            Refine this solution based on feedback:

            Solution: {solution}
            Feedback: {extract_feedback(verification)}

            Create an improved solution addressing all issues.
            '''

            solution = call_llm(refinement_prompt)
        ```

        ## Key Adaptation Points
        - Added grid-specific terminology to all prompts
        - Modified pattern identification to focus on spatial relationships
        - Added grid-specific hypotheses and testing
        - Customized verification criteria for grid transformations
        - Combined four different patterns in a cohesive workflow

=== INITIAL DATASET ANALYSIS [2025-05-06 21:50:16] ===

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Patterns in Questions:**
    *   All questions follow a consistent format: "Grid Transformation Task\n\n=== TRAINING EXAMPLES ===\n\nExample 1:\nInput Grid:\n...\nOutput Grid:\n...\n\n=== TEST INPUT ===\n...\nTransform the test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples."
    *   The structured format with labeled training examples (Input/Output Grids) and a "TEST INPUT" grid is ripe for targeted parsing.
    *   The training examples provide input-output pairs to illustrate the transformation rule.
    *   The core task is to infer the transformation rule from the examples and apply it to the test input. The core task involves discerning and applying patterns related to spatial relationships and value transformations within grids. This differs from tasks that focus on relationships *between* grids.
    *   The training examples aim to demonstrate the transformation rule. They are visually clear and well-defined. The test input is almost always a novel variation of these training examples.
    *   Questions tend to vary in grid sizes, number of training examples, and complexity of the transformation rule.

*   **Patterns in Answers:**
    *   Answers are always grid structures, represented as lists of lists.
    *   The numbers within the grids are typically integers.
    *   The answer grid's dimensions are dependent on the input grid and the inferred transformation.
    *   The answers directly reflect the application of the transformation rule to the test input.

*   **Structure and Format:**
    *   **Input:** Questions are text-based, containing structured information about the training examples and the test input, with grids formatted as lists of lists represented as strings.
    *   **Output:** Answers are grid structures in a string representation.
    *   Grids are typically represented as two-dimensional arrays of integers.

*   **Domain Knowledge:**
    *   **Spatial Reasoning:** Understanding how shapes, patterns, and arrangements change.
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying repeating sequences or relationships within the grids.
    *   **Logical Inference:** Deducing the transformation rule based on limited examples.
    *   **Array Manipulation:** Understanding how to access and modify elements within a grid.

*   **Question Types:**
    *   All questions are of the same general type: *grid transformation*. However, the specific transformations vary, leading to different sub-types:
        *   **Expansion and Value Replication:** Expanding the grid dimensions and repeating values (Example 0).
        *   **Value Modification based on Position/Neighbors:** Changing values based on their location or the values of adjacent cells (Example 1).
        *   **Complex Combination:** Combining aspects of expansion, replication, and conditional modification (Example 4).

*   **Reasoning Types:**
    *   **Inductive Reasoning:** Generalizing a rule from specific examples. This is core to all the examples.
    *   **Spatial Reasoning:** Understanding the relationships between grid elements.
    *   **Algorithmic Reasoning:** Formulating a step-by-step process to transform the grid.
    *   **Edge Case Handling:** Determining how the transformation applies to elements on the borders of the grid.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Initial Grid Extraction:** The `extract_grid` function works well for extracting the grid data, which is essential for the subsequent processing. This successful extraction is a crucial foundation.
*   **Solution Strategies:**
    1.  **Pattern Matching and Rule Extraction:**
        *   Analyze the training examples to identify the changes between input and output grids.
        *   Formulate a symbolic representation of the transformation rule. This can be thought of as a short program or set of instructions.
    2.  **Transformation Simulation:**
        *   Implement the inferred rule as a series of operations on the grid.
        *   Apply the operations to the test input.
    3.  **Example-Based Reasoning:**
        *   Compare the test input to the training inputs to identify similar patterns.
        *   Adapt the transformation from the closest training example to the test input.
    4.  **Decomposition:** Break down the grid transformation into smaller, manageable sub-transformations.

*   **Decomposition:**
    1.  **Dimension Analysis:** Determine how the dimensions (rows and columns) of the grid change.
    2.  **Value Mapping:** Identify how individual values are transformed (e.g., 0 becomes 2, 1 becomes 2).
    3.  **Neighborhood Analysis:** Analyze how a cell's value is influenced by its neighbors.
    4.  **Rule Combination:** Combine these individual transformations to create the complete rule.

*   **Validation Techniques:**
    1.  **Symmetry Checks:** Verify if the transformation preserves or introduces symmetry in the grid.
    2.  **Value Distribution:** Analyze if the distribution of values changes in a predictable way.
    3.  **Visual Inspection:** (If possible) Display the transformed grid to check for obvious errors.
    4.  **Training example re-application:** Re-apply the inferred transformation to the training inputs. Do you get the training outputs?

*   **Text-Based Techniques:**

    Given the preference for text-based processing to avoid JSON parsing complexities, I suggest these specific techniques:

    1.  **Direct Pattern Extraction from Text:**
        *   Use regex or string manipulation to directly identify the grid dimensions and values from the input text.
        *   Write functions that operate on string representations of grids to extract relevant information.
    2.  **Symbolic Rule Encoding in Text:**
        *   Represent the inferred transformation rule in natural language as a string. For example:
            *   `"Each cell is multiplied by 2"`
            *   `"Expand grid 3x3. If cell value is X, replace with Y."`
        *   The LLM then uses this string description to perform the transformation.
    3.  **Step-by-Step Transformation Instructions:**
        *   Instead of a complex program, give the LLM a series of explicit instructions, like:
            1.  `"Read the input grid."`
            2.  `"Determine the grid's dimensions."`
            3.  `"For each cell, apply the following rule: ..."`
            4.  `"Construct the output grid with the transformed values."`
            5.  `"Format the output grid as a list of lists."`
    4.  **Few-Shot Learning with Demonstrations:**
        *   Augment the prompt with additional examples that demonstrate the step-by-step reasoning process. This can guide the LLM's reasoning and improve its performance.
    5.  **Output Formatting Prompts:**
        *   Provide the LLM with explicit instructions on how to format the output grid. For example:
            *   `"The output must be a string representation of a list of lists, with each inner list representing a row in the grid."`
            *   `"Use commas to separate the numbers in each row, and enclose each row in square brackets."`
        * **Contextualized Verification:** Give the LLM all the components (input, rule, transformed output) within the verification prompt. This helps it directly compare and evaluate correctness.
        *   **Example Application in Rule Prompt:** Make the LLM explicitly demonstrate how the inferred rule applies to one of the training examples *within the "rule identification" prompt*. This tests its understanding of the rule *before* it's applied to the test input.

By focusing on leveraging the LLM's natural language understanding and reasoning abilities, we can minimize the need for complex code generation and JSON parsing, leading to more robust and efficient solutions.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Difficulty Factors:**
    *   **Ambiguity:** The training examples may not fully specify the transformation rule, leading to multiple possible interpretations.
    *   **Abstraction:** The rules may be abstract and not directly related to the numerical values.
    *   **Complexity:** Some transformations involve intricate combinations of steps.
    *   **Limited Examples:** Often, only a few examples are provided, making generalization difficult.

*   **Edge Cases and Complexities:**
    *   **Grid Boundaries:** Rules might behave differently at the edges of the grid.
    *   **Varying Grid Sizes:** The rule may need to adapt to different input grid dimensions.
    *   **Nested Patterns:** The rule might involve multiple levels of pattern recognition (e.g., identifying sub-patterns within the grid).
    *   **Conditional Transformations:** Certain transformations may depend on specific conditions within the input grid.

*   **Reasoning Requirements:**
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying the core transformation being applied.
    *   **Abstraction:** Representing the transformation in a general, reusable form.
    *   **Rule Application:** Consistently applying the rule to the test input.
    *   **Verification:** Ensuring that the transformed grid adheres to the inferred rule.

*   **Rule Application Inconsistency:** The LLM can identify the transformation rule in training examples, but struggles to *consistently and accurately* apply that rule to the test input grid. This is the primary bottleneck.
    *   *Example (Incorrect Sample 0):* Correctly identifies the need to remove a column and sum rows, but then miscalculates or misapplies the summing operation. The reasoning chain goes wrong at the application phase.
*   **Reasoning Errors and Verification Breakdown:** Even when the system identifies an error in its transformation (as in Incorrect Sample 0), it fails to correctly correct itself to produce a valid result. The verification step, even when flagging an error, doesn't trigger effective recovery.
*   **Inability to handle complex patterns involving repetitions:** The LLM fails to translate complex transformation rules into code (Incorrect Sample 1). This indicates difficulty in following the reasoning.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   **Hypothesis: LLM can directly apply inferred rules => REJECTED.** The 0% accuracy directly confirms this. The initial assumption that the LLM can reliably apply the identified rule is clearly incorrect.
    *   **Hypothesis: Grid extraction is a solved problem => CONFIRMED.** `extract_grid` function is working as intended.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Implement Step-by-Step Transformation:** Enhance the prompt to force the LLM to explicitly break down the transformation rule into individual steps. The goal is to make the transformation process more transparent and debuggable.
*   **Error Recovery Mechanism:** Develop a mechanism to handle failed verifications. If verification fails, the system should re-prompt the "transformation" stage with an error message and potentially re-run the "rule inference" step as well.
*   **Prompt for VALID or INVALID:** The verification prompt should be adapted to ask to output "VALID" or "INVALID" only.
*   **Unusual/Edge Case Handling:**
    *   **Default Values:** Define a default value to use when the rule cannot be applied (e.g., for out-of-bounds cells).
    *   **Conditional Logic:** Incorporate conditional statements into the rule to handle specific cases.
    *   **Exception Handling:** Catch and handle errors that occur during the transformation process.

*   **Creative Insights:**
    *   **Non-Obvious Patterns:**
        *   **Frequency Analysis:** Look at how often each number occurs in the input and output grids; this may reveal patterns or biases in the transformation.
        *   **Delta Grids:** Create a grid that represents the *difference* between the input and output grids. This can highlight the parts of the grid that are changing.
    *   **Unique Perspectives:**
        *   **Treating Grids as Images:** Use image processing techniques (blur, edge detection, etc.) to find patterns and transformations. This is only an analogy to guide the reasoning.
    *   **Analogies:**
        *   **Cellular Automata:** Drawing an analogy to cellular automata, where each cell updates based on its neighbors, might help in defining local transformation rules.
        *   **Image Resizing Algorithms:** Relate grid expansion to image resizing and use related algorithms.

*   **Implementation Recommendations:**
    *   **Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Rule Consistency:** Check that the inferred transformation rule is consistent across all training examples.
        2.  **Boundary Condition Testing:** Specifically test how the rule applies to elements near the grid boundaries.
        3.  **Intermediate State Inspection:** If possible, visualize the grid at intermediate steps during the transformation.

    *   **Intermediate Representations:**
        1.  **Symbolic Rule Representation:** Represent the inferred rule as a symbolic expression or a sequence of operations. Example: `"Expand grid by factor of 3. Replace 1 with 2."`
        2.  **Transformation Matrix:** If the transformation involves linear operations, use a transformation matrix. (Less likely to be helpful here).
        3.  **Heatmaps:** Visualize the changes in the grid with heatmaps to identify transformation hotspots.

            CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
            SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


            

        TOP PERFORMING APPROACHES TO BUILD UPON:
        
        

        EXPLOITATION GUIDANCE:
        1. Review the error patterns, targeted improvements, and accumulated learnings carefully
        2. CRITICAL: Break down the problem into distinct reasoning steps before modifying code
        3. CRITICAL: Analyze the best scripts to identify which components are working well and which are failing. Focus your improvements on the weak points while preserving successful components.
        4. Maintain the core successful elements of the best approaches
        5. Consider how you can combine strengths from multiple top-performing approaches
        6. CRITICAL: Add EMBEDDED EXAMPLES to EVERY LLM prompt that illustrate:
           - Sample input that resembles the dataset
           - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
           - Properly formatted output
        7. Focus on fixing specific issues identified in previous error analyses. Create an EXPLICIT HYPOTHESIS for each targeted improvement and state it, as well as a way to verify if it's successful. Carefully and fairly evaluate whether the hypothesis should be accepted, rejected, re-tested, or something else, making reference to specific outputs, reasoning steps, error messages, or other evidence from the exectuion.
        8. Enhance chain-of-thought reasoning and verification steps. Verification steps should be added to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
        9. Apply the key insights from ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS to enhance the approach
        10. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment

        IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
        Analyze why the top approaches succeeded where others failed. Identify the key differentiators and strengthen them further.

        SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT APPROACH:
        1. First, identify which specific function or component is underperforming based on error analysis
        2. Examine how error cases differ from successful cases
        3. For each identified weakness, implement a targeted enhancement
        4. Add additional verification steps around modified components
        5. Consider how components interact - ensure improvements don't break successful parts

        Consider enhancing the script with one or more of these patterns:
        - Repeated validation with feedback loops
        - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
        - Dynamic input-dependent routing
        - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
        - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
        - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
        - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
        - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for refinement with feedback

        Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
        def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

        Since this is an EXPLOITATION phase:
        - Build upon what's working well in the best approaches
        - Consider creative combinations of successful techniques from different scripts
        - Make TARGETED improvements to address specific error patterns
        - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
          * Sample input similar to the dataset
          * Expected reasoning steps
          * Desired output format
        - Apply the knowledge from our accumulated learnings
        - Significantly enhance the script to address weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

        CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
        1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
        2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
        3. Include detailed comments explaining your improvements
        4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
           - Sample input with reasoning
           - Desired output format
        5. Make proper use of error handling
        6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
        7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

        Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
        1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
        2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
        3. Has proper error handling for API calls
        4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
        5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
        6. Closes all string literals properly

        BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

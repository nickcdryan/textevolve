    EXPLORATION: This script implements a **knowledge retrieval and answer generation** approach.
    It leverages the LLM to identify key concepts, uses those to reformulate a search query,
    and then synthesizes the search results with the original question to generate a final answer.

    Hypothesis: Integrating external knowledge retrieval into the QA process will significantly improve
    accuracy by providing the LLM with additional context and factual information, particularly for questions
    requiring numerical or temporal reasoning. This approach will be better for complex questions than previous methods.

    Key Differences from Previous Approaches:
    1. Explicit knowledge retrieval step using LLM-driven query reformulation
    2. Integration of search results directly into the answer generation prompt.

    Improvements Addressed:
    - Information Synthesis Failure: This framework forces the LLM to use external retrieved knowledge and integrate it when forming a final answer.
    - Complex Reasoning: Knowledge retrieval step uses an external knowledge base for more information, which will help for more complex questions.
    - Inaccurate Numerical/Temporal extraction: The retrieval process may help clarify or verify key numbers or dates.

    "question": "PASSAGE: After the first three possessions of the game ended in punts, the Patriots marched 62 yards to the Bills 14-yard line, but the drive ended with Gostkowski missing a 36-yard field goal. On the third play of the Bills resulting possession, though, Kyle Orton was intercepted by Jamie Collins at the Patriots 39-yard line. The Patriots marched 61 yards in just five plays to take the lead on a 1-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Tim Wright. After both teams punted, the Bills lugged 67 yards in just under 5 minutes to tie the game 7-7 on a Kyle Orton touchdown pass to Robert Woods. After a Patriots three-and-out, Orton was strip-sacked by Chandler Jones with Jones recovering at the Bills 24. The Patriots didn't gain a single yard, however, but Gostkowski was successful on a 42-yard field goal try. With 0:06 seconds left in the half, the Bills were attempting to run out the clock, but McCourty stripped C. J. Spiller with Zach Moore recovering at the Bills 42. Brady hit Edelman on a quick 7 yards pass and Gostkowski kicked a 53-yarder for a 13-7 lead at the half. After receiving the opening kickoff of the second half the Patriots reached the Bills 43 in just five plays before Brady launched a bomb to Brian Tyms for a 43-yard touchdown, increasing the New England lead to 20-7. The Bills struck right back with a 13 play, 80-yard drive in just under 7 minutes, culminating in Fred Jackson scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run. The Patriots marched 56 yards on their next possession with Gostkowski adding a 40-yard field goal to increase the lead to 23-14. After a Bills punt Brady led the Patriots down the field and, with just over 6 minutes remaining, found his favorite target, Gronkowski, for a 17-yard touchdown, but the play was nullified for an offensive holding penalty on Jordan Devey. This would prove to just be a delay, because Brady threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to LaFell two plays later, capping a 12 play, 80-yard drive. The Patriots now led 30-14 and looked to be well on their way to victory. However, the Bills wouldn't go away quietly. Kyle Orton calmly engineered an 8 play, 80-yard drive, aided by a 35-yard completion on 4th-and-2, that ended in his 8-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan, with a successful two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to one possession, 30-22. Starting at the Patriots 7, Brady converted a 3rd-and-16 with a 17-yard completion to Gronkowski, and a few plays later found LaFell on a medium pass, who turned upfield and raced down the sideline for a 56-yard touchdown, increasing the Patriots lead to 37-22. The Bills reached their own 42 on their final drive, but a sack by Rob Ninkovich and an incomplete pass intended for Scott Chandler on 4th-and-9 officially sealed the deal. Brady completed 27 of 37 passes for 361 yards, with 4 touchdowns and no interceptions. Kyle Orton was equally very impressive, finishing the game  24 of 38 for 299 yards, with 2 TDs and 1 INT. With 4 catches for 97 yards and 2 touchdowns, LaFell continued to be the Patriots awaited deep-threat at wide receiver. Both teams struggled to run the football. Stevan Ridley ran for only 23 yards on 10 carries, while Fred Jackson ran for only 26 yards on 10 carries. Unfortunately, it was later learned the Patriots lost Stevan Ridley and linebacker Jerod Mayo to season ending injuries.\n\nQUESTION: What yard line did both teams score from?",

In the first quarter, Detroit was on the board first as kicker Jason Hanson got a 25-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Lions increased their lead as Hanson got a 23-yard field goal. The Vikings would close out the half as kicker Ryan Longwell got a 35-yard field goal. During the first half, Moran Norris was ejected by referee Jerome Boger for throwing a punch at Minnesota's Napoleon Harris. In the third quarter, Minnesota took the lead as RB Chester Taylor got a 17-yard TD run. Detroit would respond with former Vikings QB Daunte Culpepper completing a 70-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. However, Minnesota got the lead again as QB Tarvaris Jackson completed an 11-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe.  In the fourth quarter, the Lions tried to rally as Hanson made a 39-yard field goal.

    "iteration": 8,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the failure of the question type determination module. This module needs to be redesigned or debugged to correctly classify the types of questions being asked (e.g., comparison, extraction, calculation). The validation logic needs to be checked for correctness or adjusted."

    "issue": "The primary issue is the **consistent off-by-one arithmetic errors** specifically in calculating the difference between two dates or years. This indicates a need for more robust and tested arithmetic functions."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 10,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's failure to accurately calculate the number of months between two specific dates mentioned in the passage, even with the information explicitly provided. This indicates a weakness in the system's temporal reasoning capabilities."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 11,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's inability to accurately identify the subject of the action \"seizing power\" from the text. The system can identify that someone seized power, but grabs the wrong person as being the target."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 12,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's lack of robust temporal reasoning capabilities, leading to incorrect answers when questions require understanding the order of events or specific dates within the passage."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 13,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's **inability to perform precise contextual reasoning and constraint handling when numerical answers are needed**.

The accurate identification of what values to compare/operate on is key."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 16,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's tendency to over-generate potential answers by listing *all* instances it can find in the passage related to the question, instead of filtering down to the *specific* information being requested by the question. This over-generation leads to answers that are too broad and include irrelevant or redundant details, failing to address the core query precisely."
  }
]

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Prompt Engineering:** Use prompt engineering to explicitly ask the LLM to extract all relevant numbers and their corresponding units and then perform the calculation. For example: \"Extract all numbers corresponding to the entities and their units. What arithmetic operations should be performed to arrive at the answer? Perform the calculation and give the final answer.\"",
  "Enhance Reasoning Chain for Temporal Questions:** When the question involves time-related calculations, force the system to explicitly state the start date, end date, and the steps used to calculate the time difference. This will allow for easier debugging.",
  "Implement Date Parsing and Calculation:** Integrate a robust date parsing library to accurately extract date information from the passage. Then, use built-in date difference functions (e.g., from the `datetime` module in Python) to calculate the exact number of months between the dates.",
  "Introduce Contrastive Learning:** Train the system using contrastive learning techniques, where it's presented with pairs of similar questions that require different answers. This will help the system learn to differentiate between subtle nuances in question wording.",
  "Implement more print statements:** Add more print statements, especially when numerical computations are performed, so that one can track how numerical data and question data is extracted and utilized by the AI system.",
  "Refine Question Parsing:** Implement more sophisticated techniques for question parsing, including dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, and question type classification. This will enable the system to better understand the relationships between words and phrases in the question.",
  "Add Unit Tests Focused on Time-Based Reasoning:** Create a suite of unit tests specifically designed to test the system's temporal reasoning capabilities, including questions that require calculating time differences in days, weeks, months, and years.",
  "Add Temporal Reasoning Module:** Implement a dedicated module for temporal reasoning that can handle date calculations, time intervals, and event ordering.",
  "Implement Semantic Similarity Measures:** Utilize semantic similarity metrics (e.g., word embeddings, sentence embeddings) to compare the question with different parts of the passage. This will help the system identify the most relevant information and avoid focusing on irrelevant details.",
  "Answer type classification:** Before generating the final answer, classify the question based on the expected answer type (e.g., numerical, descriptive, boolean). Use this classification to guide the answer generation process. For example, if the expected answer type is numerical, prioritize extracting numbers and performing calculations."

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return solution_result["solution"]

        def extract_entities_with_verification(question, max_attempts=3):
            #Extract entities and verify their validity with feedback loop.
            system_instruction = "You are an expert at extracting and validating entities."

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

# DATASET-SPECIFIC LEARNINGS & EXPERIMENT LOG

This document tracks our evolving understanding and experimental findings related to the question answering task on the current dataset. It serves as a long-term memory to guide future research and development efforts.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **General:**
    *   The dataset consists of passages describing events (primarily American football games or political events), followed by fact-based questions requiring information retrieval directly from the passage. No external knowledge is needed.
    *   Questions often involve numerical reasoning (arithmetic, comparisons), and general knowledge application.
    *   Passages can be lengthy, requiring careful reading. Case sensitivity is observed.
    *   Questions often involve comparing or relating two or more pieces of information in the passage, frequently asking for numerical information (quantities, dates, names), requiring precise extraction and comparison.
    *   Passages often present multiple entities or events; questions require distinguishing between them and relating correct information.
    *   Questions may require synthesizing information from multiple sentences or inferring from disparate facts.
    *   Many questions involve interpreting percentages or proportions, requiring correct identification of the base number.
    *   Questions often test the understanding of specific terminology within the passage's context.
    *   The dataset presents questions that require **numerical reasoning and contextual linking**. Many questions ask for percentage differences or values derived from information spread across sentences.
    *   Questions frequently involve **extracting and comparing numerical values**. The system needs to identify the correct numerical values from the passage and perform arithmetic operations.
    *   The dataset contains questions where the **answer is not explicitly stated** but requires inferential reasoning based on the context provided in the passage. Sometimes the answer can't be found in the text.
    *   **Complex Reasoning:** The questions frequently require integrating information from multiple parts of the passage, going beyond simple fact retrieval.

*   **Sports Context:** The dataset heavily features sports passages, often game recaps or summaries. The questions frequently ask about specific numerical details like yardage, scores, or player statistics. Passages are dense with numbers, requiring precise parsing, especially in sports narratives. Basic sports terminology (football positions, scoring) is needed for sports-related examples. Questions about sports narratives can induce errors because they require understanding of event order and accurate extraction of details.
*   **Multiple Relevant Instances:** Questions often implicitly require the model to identify *all* instances of a particular event or object within the passage. For example, "What yard line did both teams score from?" or "How many yards were each of Gostkowski's field goals?". This requires identifying and extracting multiple pieces of information.
*   **Implicit Comparisons/Filters:** Some questions demand the model to perform a simple calculation (e.g., difference, sum) or filter based on a condition after extracting information. An example is the question "How many more households were there with couples married without children than households married with children?".

*   **Entity Relationship Extraction:**
    *   The dataset presents questions requiring identifying relationships between entities within a passage. The target relationship often involves actions (e.g., seizing power, causing casualties) and the entities involved (agent and target).
    *   Questions frequently require pinpointing the target/subject of an action, even when multiple related entities are mentioned in close proximity. This demands precise understanding of sentence structure and pronoun references. The model confuses the person who *preceded* the power seizure with the *victim* of the power seizure (e.g., confusing King William II of Sicily with Queen Joan). The system fails to correctly identify the subject of an action.
    *   The passages are concise, but contain sufficient detail that incorrect attribution is easy.

*   **Date/Time Reasoning:**
    *   A recurring pattern is the need to calculate durations (years, months, days) based on dates or time spans mentioned in the passage. This requires precise arithmetic and attention to inclusivity/exclusivity. A significant portion of the questions requires understanding and comparing dates and events described in the passage. The questions often ask "Which happened later?" or require calculating time differences. A recurring failure mode involves incorrect calculation of the number of months between two dates mentioned in the passage.
    *   **Temporal Reasoning:** Some questions require understanding and comparing events that occur at different times in the passage. Chronological order of events is important. Time-related keywords (e.g., "final," "first," "later," "second") help narrow the search.

*   **Explicit Information Retrieval:**
    *   The questions often require directly extracting and processing information explicitly stated in the passage, rather than making complex inferences.

*   **Numeric Answers:**
    *   Many questions seek numeric answers, making them easily verifiable but also sensitive to arithmetic errors. Some questions require extracting specific numbers from the passage and then comparing them to determine the highest or lowest value.
    *   **Numerical Reasoning:** A significant number of questions involve numerical comparisons or calculations based on extracted data.

*   **Question Structure:**
    *   All questions follow the format: `"PASSAGE:\n[passage text]\n\nQUESTION: [question text]"`.
    *   Many questions involve numerical reasoning and comparison (e.g., "How many yards longer...", "Which star has a smaller mass...").
    *   Some questions ask for specific entities (e.g., "Who caught the final touchdown...", "Who threw the second longest touchdown pass?").
    *   Questions frequently ask for numerical information (e.g., "How many...?", "How many yards...?").
    *   The system does not appear to know how to resolve "who" questions.

*   **Answer Structure:**
    *   Answers are typically short phrases, numbers, or names.

*   **Passage Structure:**
    *   Passages vary in content (sports summaries, scientific descriptions like astronomy, political events).
    *   Passages are dense with numbers, requiring precise parsing, especially in sports narratives.

*   **Domain Knowledge:**
    *   General reading comprehension is crucial. For demographic examples, basic understanding of fertility rates is needed.

*   **Question Types:**
    *   Entity Extraction: Identifying specific players or entities involved in events (e.g., identifying the subject of a power seizure).
    *   Numerical Comparison: Comparing numerical values (yards, scores, TFR, mass) to determine differences.
    *   Counting: Counting the number of occurrences of an event or entity.

*   **Reasoning Types:**
    *   Direct Extraction: Finding the answer directly stated in the passage.
    *   Simple Arithmetic: Performing basic calculations (addition, subtraction) using numbers from the passage.
    *   Logical Deduction: Combining information from different parts of the passage to arrive at the answer.
    *   Multi-Sentence Reasoning: Correct answers often require synthesizing information from multiple sentences scattered throughout the passage, rather than being directly stated in a single sentence.

*   **Non-Obvious Patterns:**
    *   Chronological order of events is important. Time-related keywords (e.g., "final," "first," "later," "second") help narrow the search.

*   **Edge Cases/Complexities:**
    *   Passages with ambiguous or contradictory information.
    *   Questions requiring more complex arithmetic operations (e.g., multiplication, division).
    *   Questions with implicit rather than explicit answers, requiring deeper inference.
    *   Handling of units (yards, points, etc.) consistently.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Keyword-Based Retrieval:** Identify keywords from the question and search for those keywords in the passage.
*   **LLM-Based Extraction & Reasoning:** Use an LLM to directly answer the question based on the passage; prompting is key.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** Combine keyword retrieval with LLM reasoning.
*   **Question Decomposition:** Decompose the question into smaller sub-questions. Breaking down complex questions into smaller, more manageable extraction tasks improves accuracy.
*   **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT):** Breaking down complex questions into smaller steps (decomposition, information extraction, synthesis) improves interpretability. However, effectiveness is limited by the system's ability to accurately understand the question's intent and extract relevant numerical data.
*   **Zero-Shot Reasoning:** Directly ask the LLM to answer the question based on the passage, using a well-crafted prompt.
*   **Text Splitting:** If passages are too long, split them into smaller chunks. Be mindful of context loss.
*   **Focus on Answer Synthesis:** Prioritize improving the `synthesize_answer` function.
*   **Specialized Agents:** The use of specialized agents (question decomposer, information extraction expert, answer synthesis expert) allows for a modular approach. Individual role definitions for LLMs need definition.
*   **Sequential Workflow:** The sequential workflow (decompose, extract, synthesize) enforces a structured problem-solving approach.
*   **Question-Type Determination and Specialized Processing:** Determine the question type (numerical vs. general) and use specialized processing. Failure in question type determination renders the entire system useless.
*   **LLM-Driven Techniques with Verification:** Combining LLM-driven techniques with verification steps at each stage is a successful pattern. However, verification is inadequate for semantic errors that stem from misinterpreting the question.
*   **Dual Verification with Iterative Refinement:** Given the accuracy is at 0.8, this approach appears promising for this dataset, providing a solid base for improvement. The hypothesis of improved accuracy through dual verification seems initially supported. However, the current implementation may be too sensitive and identifies a wide range of related answers.
*   **Dynamic Approach Selection:** Adapting the strategy based on the type of question being asked proves important.
*   **Leveraging distinct agent roles:** Question decomposer, information extraction expert, answer synthesizer help specialize the tasks.
*   **Chain-of-thought for focusing information extraction:** Aids in focusing the information extraction process.
*   **Validating intermediate steps:** Decomposition and extraction likely contributes to the overall accuracy.
*   Providing examples in LLM prompts improves performance.
*   Explicitly prompting the LLM to show its work (intermediate calculations) helps in debugging.
*   **Self-Debate:** The self-debate strategy *attempts* to address potential errors. The agent tries to verify their answers. The agent recognizes the importance of calculation but isn't consistently accurate.
*   **Question Clarification & Focused Extraction:** The "Question Clarification & Focused Extraction" approach demonstrates potential. Clarifying the question's intent before extraction *should* ideally improve precision.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **General Script Errors:**
    *   `NameError: name 'call_llm' is not defined`. This prevents any actual processing.
*   **Root Cause: Incorrect Question Type Determination:** The entire system fails because the `determine_question_type()` function consistently returns an error. This highlights that the question type determination module is a single point of failure.
*   **Temporal Reasoning Errors:** The system struggles with correctly ordering events and calculating time differences. The primary failure mode involves incorrect calculation of the number of months between two dates mentioned in the passage. This indicates a deficiency in the system's temporal arithmetic capabilities. Off-by-One Errors in Duration Calculation: Consistently making off-by-one errors when calculating the duration between two dates or years. Misinterpretation of Inclusion/Exclusion: The agent sometimes struggles to correctly interpret whether the start and end dates/years should be included in the duration calculation.
*   **Answer Synthesis Failure:** Inability to synthesize a valid answer, even when the correct information is extracted. The system struggles to provide fully complete answers, especially when context, units, or modifiers from the original passage are needed. When the question requires identifying entities based on multiple criteria (e.g., "countries with more than one date"), the system struggles to filter out irrelevant entities.
*   **Over-generation of Instances:** The "Dual Verification with Iterative Refinement" approach often retrieves *all* possible instances related to the question from the passage, even when not all are directly relevant. This leads to overly detailed and noisy answers.
*   **Lack of Aggregation/Filtering:** The system struggles to perform necessary filtering or aggregation after extracting the information.
*   **Sports narrative complexity:** Questions about sports narratives can induce errors because they require understanding of event order and accurate extraction of details.
*   **Validation sensitivity:** Validation checks can be overly strict, but are still often insufficient.
*   **Information Extraction Failure:** Errors in information extraction contribute to failures in answer synthesis. Inaccurate or incomplete extracted information leads to incorrect final answers. In some cases, the extraction mechanism pulls *additional* correct information when only *specific* information is requested, leading to incorrect answers.
    *   **Inaccurate Information Extraction & Arithmetic:** The system fails when questions require extracting specific data points from the passage (e.g., field goal lengths) and then performing arithmetic operations (e.g., subtraction) on them. Numerical extraction errors occur when incorrectly identifying or extracting numerical values from the passage.
*   **Ambiguous Passages:** Passages with ambiguous or contradictory information can lead to incorrect answers.
*   **Missing Information:** If the answer cannot be found in the passage, this leads to a failure.
*   **Lack of Arithmetic Reasoning:** Inability to perform arithmetic operations, particularly simple addition.
*   **Potential for Masked Limitations:** High accuracy can mask the system's vulnerability to more complex reasoning.
*   **Calculation errors:** Performing incorrect arithmetic operations on extracted numbers. Even when the correct numerical values are extracted, the system sometimes fails to perform the correct calculation or comparison.
*   **Synthesis errors:** Generating a response that is not a coherent or accurate answer to the question.
*   **Question type misclassification**: Incorrectly classifying a question as numerical or general.
*   **Unit Handling:** Lack of proper unit handling leads to incomplete or misinterpreted answers.
*   **Misinterpretation of Question Intent:** The system struggles to accurately interpret the nuances of the question.
*   **Incorrect Numerical Calculation:** The system makes errors in numerical calculations.
*   **Lack of Verification:** The system lacks a final answer verification step to check the reasonableness of the answer.
*   **Numerical Extraction in Dense Passages:** Difficulty in accurately extracting numerical values and associating them with the correct entities.
*   **Incorrect Subject Identification:** The system fails to correctly identify the subject of an action. The model confuses the person who *preceded* the power seizure with the *victim* of the power seizure.
*   **Proximity Bias:** The LLM seems to exhibit proximity bias, selecting entities mentioned closer to the action verb, even if they are not the correct subject.
*   **Lack of Deep Understanding of Numerical Comparisons:** While the system can extract numbers, it appears to sometimes fail to associate the numbers with the correct context, leading to incorrect comparisons.
*   **Lack of "Who" Question Understanding:** The system does not appear to know how to resolve "who" questions.
*   **Semantic Equivalence:** Errors occur when the system gives an answer that is not semantically equivalent to the reference answer.
*   **Misinterpretation of context:** The system misinterprets what the questions are asking, leading to an incorrect answer or a denial to answer the question at all.
*   **Incorrect extractions:** The system extracts the wrong entities from the passage leading to a wrong answer.
*   **Incorrect formatting:** The system incorrectly formatted the answer (added extra spaces in the answer). Make sure the extraction returns a number.

*   **ITERATION 4:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 1.0
    *   **Goal:** Improve answer completeness, focusing on context, units, and modifiers.
    *   **Finding:** Achieving 1.0 accuracy suggests that the overall strategy of chain-of-thought, role-based agents, and validation is effective.
    *   **Finding:** The primary area for improvement is in the completeness and context of the final answer.
*   **ITERATION 5:**
    *   **Finding:** Chain-of-thought benefits are diminished by semantic errors in question interpretation.
    *   **Finding:** Verification steps are inadequate for addressing semantic errors.

    *   **Goal:** Improve semantic understanding and numerical reasoning capabilities by leveraging chain-of-thought, prompt examples, and showing work.
    *   **Finding:** The chain-of-thought approach with question decomposition, information extraction, and answer synthesis showed promise.
    *   **Finding:** Providing examples in LLM prompts seems to improve performance.
    *   **Finding:** Explicitly prompting the LLM to show its work (intermediate calculations) helped in debugging.
    *   **Finding:** Inconsistent and unreliable arithmetic calculations are a major failure mode.

    *   **Finding:** The `determine_question_type()` function consistently failed, leading to a complete system failure.
    *   **Finding:** The question type determination module is a single point of failure.
*   **ITERATION 9:**
    *   **Goal:** Improve handling of date/time reasoning, specifically duration calculations.
    *   **Finding:** The "Reading Comprehension Expert" agent with self-debate, in its current form, is not robust enough to prevent common arithmetic errors, especially off-by-one errors in duration calculation.
    *   **Finding:** The agent's general reasoning capabilities are insufficient for accurate duration calculations.
    *   **Finding:** Self-Debate Alone Is Insufficient: The agent identifies the potential for errors but fails to consistently avoid them.
*   **ITERATION 10:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.80
*   **2025-05-17 20:26:38: SCRIPT ERROR**
    *   Error detected during script repair (attempt 1): ERROR: Script requires external information to provide an answer.
*   **2025-05-17 20:26:49: SCRIPT ERROR**
    *   Error detected during script repair (attempt 2): ERROR: No passage provided.
*   **ITERATION 11:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.80
    *   **Goal:** Improve accuracy by clarifying the question's intent before information extraction.
    *   **Finding:** Clarifying the question isn't enough; the extraction phase needs to be more robust to identifying the correct entity related to a specific action.
    *   **Failure Example:** Incorrect subject identification. For example, in the question about King Tancred seizing power, the LLM incorrectly identifies "King William II of Sicily" instead of the correct answer, "Queen Joan." This indicates a weakness in parsing complex sentences and understanding the relationships between entities and actions. The model confuses the person who *preceded* the power seizure with the *victim* of the power seizure.

    *   **Accuracy:** 0.60
    *   **Goal:** Improve performance with better handling of temporal and numerical reasoning by leveraging question decomposition and validation.
    *   **Finding:** Validation may be too simplistic and the final answer may still be wrong.
*   **ITERATION 13:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.70
    *   **Goal:** Improve performance with an exploitation strategy with chain-of-thought reasoning.
    *   **Finding:** The use of examples in LLM prompts alone is insufficient to overcome the challenges of numerical reasoning and constraint application.
*   **ITERATION 14:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.60
    *   **Goal:** Improve performance with an exploitation strategy with chain-of-thought reasoning.
    *   **Finding:** The chain-of-thought approach helps, but the individual components need to be more robust, especially in handling numerical data and conditional filtering.
    *   **Failure Examples:**
        *   "Billy Cundiff vs. Sebastian Janikowski" question: Incorrect identification of field goal lengths, leading to a wrong calculation due to failure in the `extract_information` stage.
        *   "Countries on the 2014 Summer tour" question: Incorrect inclusion of "Germany" due to failure to properly filter based on the "more than one date" condition in the `synthesize_answer` stage.
*   **ITERATION 15:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.70
    *   **Finding:** The reliance on chain-of-thought prompting is not sufficient to guarantee accurate numerical extraction and calculation.
    *   **Failure Examples:**
        *   "How many more yards was Nate Kaeding's second field goal over his first?": The system extracted "27" instead of calculating the difference between 51 and 24.
        *   Semantic equivalence: Errors occur when the system gives an answer that is not semantically equivalent to the reference answer, for example, "Novgorod" vs "Novgorodians".
*   **ITERATION 16:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.80
    *   **Finding:** The Dual Verification with Iterative Refinement approach appears promising but needs refinement to avoid over-generation of instances and improve aggregation/filtering.

*   **Refine Extraction Prompts:** Modify the `extract_information` prompt to explicitly instruct the LLM to focus on identifying the *subject* of the action described in the question, not just any related entity. Include examples of correct and incorrect subject identification.
*   **Add Subject-Verb-Object Triplet Identification:** Incorporate a step to identify subject-verb-object triplets in the passage, focusing on the verbs related to the question. This can help the model explicitly reason about the agent and target of the action.
*   **Improve Clarification of "Who" questions:** Explicitly instruct the LLM that "who" questions must be answered with the name of a person.

*   **Improve the answer formatting:** Avoid the addition of extra spaces in the answer. Make sure the extraction returns a number.
*   **Strengthen Information Extraction for Numerical Data:** Refine the `extract_information` function to be more precise in identifying and extracting relevant numerical values. This could involve using regular expressions or named entity recognition (NER) models specifically trained to identify numbers and units.
*   **Strengthen Calculation Logic:** Explicitly implement calculation logic within the `synthesize_answer` function to ensure that numerical values are processed correctly. This could involve creating separate functions for addition, subtraction, comparison, etc.
*   **Improve Conditional Filtering in Answer Synthesis:** Enhance the `synthesize_answer` function to better apply multiple conditions and constraints when filtering extracted information. Explore using a more structured representation of the conditions to ensure they are correctly applied.

            TOP PERFORMING APPROACHES TO BUILD UPON:
            
TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #1:
Iteration: 1
Accuracy: 1.00
Approach Summary: The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with question decomposition and verification steps to answer a question. The problem is decomposed into sub-questions, then relevant information is extracted, and finally, an answer is synthesized. Three agent roles are used: question decomposer, information extraction expert, and answer synthesis expert, each implemented through specific prompts to the LLM. The functions used are `main` which orchestrates the process, `decompose_question` which breaks down the question, `extract_information` which gathers relevant information, `synthesize_answer` which formulates the final answer, and `call_llm` which interfaces with the Gemini API; these functions are called sequentially to solve the problem. The overall workflow is to decompose, extract, and synthesize, with validation steps at each stage to ensure correctness.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #2:
Iteration: 2
Accuracy: 1.00
Approach Summary: The script addresses question answering by first determining the question type and then processing it accordingly. Numerical questions are processed by extracting numerical information and calculating the answer, while general questions are addressed through question decomposition, information extraction, and answer synthesis. The agent roles are: question type identifier, numerical information extractor, calculator, question decomposer, information extraction expert, and answer synthesis expert. Key functions include `determine_question_type`, `process_numerical_question`, `extract_numerical_info`, `calculate_answer`, `process_general_question`, `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, `synthesize_answer`, and `call_llm`; these functions are chained together to process the question and generate an answer using LLM-driven techniques with verification steps at each stage. The overall workflow involves determining question type, processing the question using a type-specific method, and returning the result or an error message.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #3:
Iteration: 4
Accuracy: 1.00
Approach Summary: The script uses a chain-of-thought approach, decomposing a question into sub-questions, extracting information, and then synthesizing an answer. It employs three distinct agent roles: a question decomposer, an information extraction expert, and an answer synthesis expert. It leverages the `call_llm` function to interact with the Gemini model using specifically crafted prompts for each agent, and incorporates validation steps after each stage to ensure correctness. The script begins with the `main` function, which orchestrates the calls to `decompose_question`, `extract_information`, and `synthesize_answer`; these functions in turn use `call_llm` to generate responses which undergo validation at each step.

            PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED VARIATIONS:
            

            EXPLOITATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the error patterns, targeted improvements, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. CRITICAL: Break down the problem into distinct reasoning steps before modifying code
            3. CRITICAL: Analyze the best scripts to identify which components are working well and which are failing. Focus your improvements on the weak points while preserving successful components.
            4. Maintain the core successful elements of the best approaches
            5. Consider how you can combine strengths from multiple top-performing approaches
            6. CRITICAL: Add EMBEDDED EXAMPLES to EVERY LLM prompt that illustrate:
               - Sample input that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            7. Focus on fixing specific issues identified in previous error analyses. Create an explicit HYPOTHESIS for each targeted improvement, as well as a way to verify if it's successful.
            8. Enhance chain-of-thought reasoning and verification steps. Verification steps should be added to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            9. Apply the key insights from ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS to enhance the approach
            10. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment

            IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
            Analyze why the top approaches succeeded where others failed. Identify the key differentiators and strengthen them further.

            SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT APPROACH:
            1. First, identify which specific function or component is underperforming based on error analysis
            2. Examine how error cases differ from successful cases
            3. For each identified weakness, implement a targeted enhancement
            4. Add additional verification steps around modified components
            5. Consider how components interact - ensure improvements don't break successful parts

            Consider enhancing the script with one or more of these patterns:
            - Repeated validation with feedback loops
            - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
            - Dynamic input-dependent routing
            - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
            - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
            - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
            - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLOITATION phase:
            - Build upon what's working well in the best approaches
            - Consider creative combinations of successful techniques from different scripts
            - Make TARGETED improvements to address specific error patterns
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply the knowledge from our accumulated learnings
            - Significantly enhance the script to address weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your improvements
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:

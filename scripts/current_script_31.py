# EXPLORATION: Visual Anchor Identification and Transformation Rule Application with Adaptive Example Selection and Validation
# HYPOTHESIS: The LLM can better generalize grid transformations by first identifying "visual anchors" (stable elements) in the grid,
# then inferring transformation rules relative to those anchors. The approach also uses an adaptive example selection strategy,
# choosing relevant training examples based on similarity to the input grid, and includes detailed validation steps to ensure the LLM
# is producing valid outputs. We will validate different parts of the pipeline to identify which part is failing.

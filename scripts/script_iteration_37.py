# EXPLORATION: LLM-Guided Iterative Grid Decomposition and Recomposition
# HYPOTHESIS: We can improve grid transformation accuracy by recursively decomposing the grid into subgrids, transforming each subgrid based on local patterns, and then recomposing the grid. This approach leverages a divide-and-conquer strategy. This approach will have error checking every step along the way.
# It differs from previous attempts by focusing on recursive subdivision combined with local pattern transformations.

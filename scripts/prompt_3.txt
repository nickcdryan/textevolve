            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

It decomposes the problem into extraction, inference, transformation, and verification steps, each handled by prompting the LLM with a specific system instruction defining the agent's role as an expert in grid transformations. The `main` function calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which orchestrates calls to `call_llm` for each step, using prompts constructed with f-strings to pass instructions and data. Function calls: `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation`, which in turn calls `call_llm` multiple times to perform the different stages of the grid transformation."

It decomposes the problem into information extraction, transformation rule inference using difference grid analysis, rule application, and verification/correction steps. No specific agent roles are defined other than \"an expert at grid transformation tasks\". The script uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API.\n\nThe overall workflow involves: `solve_grid_transformation` which calls `call_llm` to get `extracted_info`, then calls `call_llm` again to get `transformation_rule`, then one more time to get `transformed_grid`. The transformed grid is verified with another call to `call_llm`. If verification fails, `call_llm` is invoked again to correct the grid, and returns either the corrected or transformed grid."

The agent role is a grid transformation expert, and other functions include `call_llm`, which facilitates interaction with the Gemini LLM. The script's workflow begins with `solve_grid_transformation`, which calls `call_llm` to extract information, infer transformation rules, apply them to a test grid, and verify the result."

  "Implement a more robust pattern recognition algorithm:**  Explore techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs), which are often used for spatial reasoning tasks like this.",
  "Explicitly model the transformation:** Instead of implicitly learning the transformation, try to model it explicitly. For example, look for patterns like \"if input cell value is X and its neighbors have value Y, then the output cell value should be Z.\"",
  "Add detailed logging:** Include logging statements to track the execution flow, variable values, and intermediate results. This will help in debugging and understanding the system's behavior.",
  "Profile the code:** Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the code and optimize them.",
  "Use intermediate representations:**  Introduce intermediate representations to capture the transformation process in a more structured way. For instance, extract features like the presence of specific numbers and their locations, then use these features to predict the output.",
  "Implement a more efficient search strategy:** If the algorithm involves searching for patterns, use techniques like pruning or heuristics to reduce the search space.",
  "Debugging and Monitoring:**",
  "Implement unit tests:**  Write unit tests to verify the correctness of individual components of the system.",

    Design a data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:

    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 2 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script solves grid transformation problems by using an LLM to infer and apply localized transformation rules. It decomposes the problem into information extraction, rule inference, rule application, and verification steps, each handled by prompting the LLM. The agent role is a grid transformation expert, and other functions include `call_llm`, which facilitates interaction with the Gemini LLM. The script's workflow begins with `solve_grid_transformation`, which calls `call_llm` to extract information, infer transformation rules, apply them to a test grid, and verify the result.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 1 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script solves grid transformation problems by using LLM-driven pattern recognition and iterative refinement. It decomposes the problem into information extraction, transformation rule inference using difference grid analysis, rule application, and verification/correction steps. No specific agent roles are defined other than "an expert at grid transformation tasks". The script uses `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini API.

The overall workflow involves: `solve_grid_transformation` which calls `call_llm` to get `extracted_info`, then calls `call_llm` again to get `transformation_rule`, then one more time to get `transformed_grid`. The transformed grid is verified with another call to `call_llm`. If verification fails, `call_llm` is invoked again to correct the grid, and returns either the corrected or transformed grid.

# Grid Transformation Task: Dataset-Specific Learning Log

This document serves as a continuously updated log of our findings, strategies, and experiments related to the grid transformation task using LLMs. It prioritizes specific insights applicable to this dataset over general system design principles.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Task Definition:** The task involves transforming a "TEST INPUT" grid based on transformation rules inferred from provided "Input Grid" and "Output Grid" training examples. The task is presented as text. Each problem includes training examples (input and output grids) and a test input grid that needs to be transformed.
*   **Grid Format:** Grids are consistently represented as 2D arrays of numerical values. Input grids, output grids, and test grids are all represented in the same format. Grids are represented as nested lists of integers within the text.
*   **Numerical Values:** Grids predominantly contain numerical values. Specific values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8) appear frequently and may hold semantic significance within the transformations.
*   **Grid Size Variance:** The dimensions (rows and columns) of grids vary significantly across questions, adding complexity to pattern recognition. Grids can be square or rectangular, and the size relationship between input and output grids is inconsistent. The training examples and test input within a single problem instance have consistent dimensions.
*   **Transformation Complexity:** Transformation rules are implicit and must be inferred from a limited number of examples. The complexity of these rules varies significantly. Transformations can involve scaling, shifting, element replacement, conditional logic, or combinations thereof. The transformation logic involves replacing certain numbers in the input grid with other numbers, based on patterns observed in the training examples. The transformations are often localized (e.g., affecting numbers within a certain proximity of another number). Transformations are not always 1:1 (a single input cell value may result in different output cell values depending on context), and there may be several changes happening at once.
*   **Inconsistent Training Examples:** The number of training examples provided is limited, making it difficult to generalize transformation rules to the test input. The training examples provided may not fully cover all aspects of the transformation rule, increasing the difficulty of pattern extraction.
*   **Symmetry Considerations:** Some transformations exhibit symmetry, while others are asymmetrical, treating rows and columns differently. Analyzing symmetry can be a useful initial step.
*   **Value Dependency:** Transformations can depend on the specific values within the grid. For example, '0' might be treated differently from '1'.
*   **Potential Size Changes:** While less frequent, transformations could potentially involve changing the grid size (adding or removing rows/columns).

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **N/A (Accuracy Consistently 0.00):** As of the latest experiments, no strategies have demonstrably improved accuracy on this dataset. Previous approaches relying solely on LLM prompt engineering for rule extraction, inference, and application have consistently failed. The initial exploitation strategy yields no success, which suggests that the LLM needs more explicit guidance to handle the spatial reasoning and pattern generalization required. The intended strategy of inferring and applying localized transformation rules is a reasonable starting point, given the patterns identified in the dataset.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Pattern Misidentification:** The LLM frequently fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation pattern, indicating a misunderstanding of how values are spatially related within the grid.
    *   *Example:* The LLM produced a grid with 2's in positions (0,0) and (2,0), while the expected output had 2's in positions (0,0) and (0,2).
*   **Inability to Generalize:** The LLM struggles to generalize observed patterns from training examples to the test input, failing to consistently apply learned transformation rules to new, unseen data.
    *   *Example:* The output grid contains a seemingly arbitrary arrangement of numbers bearing little resemblance to the expected output, demonstrating the model's inability to consistently apply learned transformation rules to unseen data.
*   **Hallucination of Patterns:** The LLM sometimes generates transformations that are not supported by the training examples, indicating hallucination of non-existent patterns.
*   **Incorrect Spatial Reasoning:** The LLM struggles with spatial reasoning tasks, such as identifying neighboring cells or applying transformations based on cell location.
*   **Output Format Correctness, Content Incorrect:** While the LLM correctly formats the output as a 2D array string, the content of the output grid is invariably incorrect, demonstrating that the issue is in grid transformation logic, not formatting.
*   **Ignoring Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** The LLM often fails to correctly handle edge cases, such as cells at the edges of the grid.
*   **Failure to Infer Transformation Rules:** The system fails to accurately infer the transformation rules from the training examples, producing completely different numerical arrays than the expected ones. This is likely because the LLM struggles to understand complex spatial relationships and number patterns within the grids and extrapolate those patterns correctly.
    *   *Concrete Finding:* The complexity of transformation from input to output is too much given the current methodology.
*   **Generation of Arbitrary Number Sequences:** The LLM generates arbitrary number sequences in the output that are not based on the training data, suggesting a failure in understanding the underlying logic of the grid transformations.
*   **Inconsistent Information Extraction and Application:** The system incorrectly extracts information and applies transformation rules, which leads to inconsistent results.
*   **Inability to identify transformation rules:** The LLM struggles to accurately deduce the transformation rules from the training examples. This is evident in the "Unable to transform the grid correctly" error messages, indicating the LLM couldn't extract the underlying logic.
*   **Poor generalization:** Even if the LLM could identify the rules for the training examples, it fails to generalize them to the test input. The error examples show the LLM doesn't apply the learnt rules correctly.
*   **Output format mismatch:** In some cases, the LLM produced an output with a completely different structure than the expected grid format, indicating a misunderstanding of the task requirements or an inability to consistently apply the transformation process.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Experiment 0 (Initial Exploitation):**
    *   *Description:* Attempted to solve the task using direct prompt engineering, providing the LLM with examples and explicit system instructions for extraction, inference, transformation, and verification.
    *   *Result:* Accuracy 0.00.
    *   *Finding:* Prompt engineering alone is insufficient for this task. The LLM needs more explicit guidance or a different approach to handle the spatial reasoning and pattern generalization required. The initial hypothesis that the LLM, guided by explicit system instructions for extraction, inference, transformation, and verification, can effectively solve these grid transformation problems is rejected.
*   **General Finding:** The current implementation is consistently failing, with an accuracy of 0.00. This indicates a fundamental problem with the approach being used. The experimental approach of relying on the LLM's general pattern-recognition abilities, without specific guidance on grid transformations, does not work. The 0.0 accuracy indicates the LLM is unable to learn and apply the grid transformation logic effectively from the given training examples. The hypothesis that an LLM, acting as a general expert, can solve these problems without more specific prompting or fine-tuning is rejected. The LLM needs additional guidance to correctly solve grid transformation tasks.
*   **Iteration 2 Results:** The LLM, in its current configuration and prompting, is unable to effectively perform grid transformation tasks based on the provided training examples. The exploration approach, which relies on the LLM's reasoning and pattern-matching capabilities, has failed to yield any successful results. The hypothesis that the LLM can infer and apply localized transformation rules directly from the given prompt is rejected. The examples show that the LLM doesn't extract the relevant information from the training examples and/or doesn't know how to apply those rules to new grid configurations.
*   **Script Error Log (2025-05-09):**
    *   05:26:33: `ERROR: Grid transformation error` (Attempt 1 during script repair)
    *   05:26:40: `ERROR: google.genai has no attribute 'configure'` (Attempt 2 during script repair)
    *   05:26:52: `ERROR: Gemini API call failed with a 404 error, indicating the model was not found or not supported.` (Attempt 3 during script repair)
    *   *Finding:* Script repair attempts reveal issues with API calls, model configuration, and general transformation errors, highlighting the fragility of the current implementation and the need for more robust error handling and API version management.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

Given the consistent failure of prompt-based approaches, the following research directions should be explored:

*   **Refine the Prompting Strategy:**
    *   Explicitly instruct the LLM to identify *relationships* between numbers and positions in the training grids.
    *   Use specific keywords related to *spatial reasoning*, such as "adjacent," "row," "column," "neighbor," and "distance".
    *   Prompt the LLM to verbalize the transformation rule it infers before applying it to the test grid. This will allow us to audit the LLM's reasoning process.
*   **Break Down the Problem Further:**
    *   Instead of a single prompt for the entire transformation, create separate prompts for identifying the transformation rule for *each unique number* in the input grid.
    *   Consider pre-processing the grid data to highlight differences between input and output grids in the training examples (e.g., create a "difference grid").
*   **Implement External Verification and Correction:**
    *   Develop a simple Python function to check if the transformed grid adheres to basic constraints (e.g., if a certain number *always* appears in a specific location).
    *   Use this function to provide feedback to the LLM if the transformation is invalid.
*   **Enhanced Pattern Representation:**
    *   Explore methods for explicitly encoding grid transformation patterns, such as representing transformations as mathematical functions or algorithms operating on grid coordinates and values, rather than relying solely on the LLM's implicit understanding.
    *   Develop a structured representation for transformation rules, potentially using a domain-specific language (DSL) or a set of predefined operators.
*   **Decomposition and Intermediate Steps:**
    *   Break down the transformation process into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.
    *   Ask the LLM to explicitly identify key features, relationships, and operations involved in the transformation, storing these outputs as intermediate variables for more detailed output.
    *   Focus on having the LLM *describe* the transformation in a step-by-step manner, using a controlled vocabulary for grid operations (e.g., "replace", "shift", "copy", "reflect", "invert", "neighbor", "adjacent", "row", "column").
*   **Iterative Refinement:**
    *   Implement a loop where the LLM proposes a transformation, evaluates its correctness on the training examples, and refines the transformation based on the evaluation results.
    *   Provide feedback to the LLM by pointing out specific cells that were transformed incorrectly, guiding it towards a more accurate transformation rule.
*   **Hybrid Approach:**
    *   Combine the LLM with symbolic reasoning or search algorithms.
    *   Use the LLM for high-level pattern recognition and feature extraction, but delegate the actual grid manipulation to a more specialized algorithm.
*   **Targeted Training:**
    *   Fine-tune the LLM on a dataset specifically designed for grid transformation tasks.
    *   This could involve generating synthetic data or curating a dataset of existing grid puzzles.
*   **Difference Grids and Symmetry Analysis:**
    *   Calculate the difference between the input and output grids to reveal underlying patterns.
    *   Check for symmetry in the input and output grids, as symmetrical transformations are often easier to identify.
*   **Value Frequency Analysis:**
    *   Analyze the frequency of different values in the input and output grids to reveal which values are being transformed into others.
*   **Explore Few-Shot Learning:**
        *   Experiment with providing a larger number of training examples within the prompt to improve the LLM's ability to generalize.
        *   Carefully select training examples that cover a range of possible transformations.
*   **Prompting Strategies to Avoid:** Avoid prompting the LLM to directly generate code (e.g., Python) to perform the grid transformation, as this often leads to syntax errors and incorrect logic.
*   **Improve rule extraction:** Implement a more robust rule extraction mechanism. This might involve techniques like:
    *   Explicitly prompting the LLM to list the transformation rules in a structured format before applying them.
    *   Incorporating a separate module to analyze the training examples and identify potential rules, which are then fed to the LLM.
*   **Enhance local transformation reasoning:**
    *   Experiment with different prompting strategies focusing on neighborhood analysis.
    *   Provide the LLM with a specific way of reasoning about transformations.
*   **Implement iterative verification:** Since the transformations are all happening at once, add an iterative verification step to the transformation application to allow for refinement.
*   **Add specific tests:** Create test cases for specific errors.

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

    ## Key Integration Points
    - Feature Extraction provides structured input for Multi-Perspective Analysis
    - Multi-Perspective Analysis feeds unified context to Chain-of-Thought
    - Self-Consistency ensures robustness of reasoning paths
    - Debate and Verification rigorously test and improve recommendations
    - Best-of-N Selection optimizes the final output format and content

    ## Benefits of Pattern Combination
    - Each pattern addresses different aspects of the complex problem
    - Later patterns build upon the outputs of earlier patterns
    - Verification catches issues that might be missed in a linear approach
    - Multiple perspectives create more robust solutions
    - Self-consistency reduces likelihood of spurious reasoning

    This example demonstrates how combining patterns creates a solution pipeline that's much more powerful than any single pattern alone, particularly for complex analytical and recommendation tasks.

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
           - If verification fails, send the output back into an earlier part of the pipeline with specific feedback from the error
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return solution_result["solution"]



        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step: this will help us debug
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails
        6. Crucially, verification should be used to catch errors in the processing pipeline and feed them back into an earlier part of the pipeline for refinement with feedback for a set number of attempts. Verification for its own sake isn't very helpful, especially as the final step.

        

            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        === INITIAL DATASET ANALYSIS [2025-05-08 03:08:37] ===

    Okay, let's dive into an analysis of this intriguing grid transformation dataset.

## DATASET CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Patterns in Questions:**

    *   The questions provide a set of training examples, showcasing input-output grid pairs.
    *   Each example is clearly labeled ("Example 1:", "Example 2:", etc.).
    *   The questions consistently follow a "TRAINING EXAMPLES ... TEST INPUT ... Transform the test input" structure.
    *   The grids are represented as lists of lists, with integer values representing colors/states.
    *   The size of the input grids varies across examples within a single question, but it seems the core transformation logic is consistent *within* a question.
    *   Questions focus on spatial relationships and transformations of the grid's contents.

*   **Patterns in Answers:**

    *   The answers are always grids represented as a list of lists, just like the inputs.
    *   The answers directly correspond to the transformed version of the "TEST INPUT" grid, following the pattern learned from the training examples.
    *   The answer grid's size is determined by the transformation pattern, and is not always the same as the input grid.

*   **Structure and Format:**

    *   *Input:* Text string containing training examples and the test input, all structured as nested lists (representing grids).
    *   *Output:* Text string representing the transformed grid, also as a nested list.
    *   Crucially, the text input is *not* necessarily valid JSON, and forcing it to be so will likely cause errors.

*   **Domain Knowledge:**

    *   **Spatial Reasoning:** Understanding how shapes, colors, and patterns interact in 2D space is crucial.
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying the underlying transformation rule from the training examples is the core skill.
    *   **Grid Manipulation:**  Knowledge of how to index, iterate over, and modify grid data is necessary.
    *   **Limited Math:** While not explicit, the grid expansion in some examples may be informed by multiplication/division.

*   **Question Types:**

    *   The examples suggest at least two major types:
        *   **Grid Expansion/Replication:**  (Example 0) The input grid is expanded into a larger grid, with values replicated based on the original pattern.
        *   **Conditional Value Modification:** (Examples 1, 2, 3, 4) Values within the grid are changed based on their position or the values of their neighbors.
    * It is likely that these can be composed arbitrarily.

*   **Reasoning Types:**

    *   **Inductive Reasoning:** Generalizing the transformation rule from training examples.
    *   **Spatial Reasoning:**  Applying the rule to the test input, considering spatial relationships.
    *   **Logical Deduction:** Inferring the correct output grid based on the learned rule.

## DATA CHALLENGES

*   **Difficulty Factors:**

    *   **Ambiguity:** The training examples might not perfectly define the transformation. There could be multiple plausible rules.
    *   **Complexity:** The underlying rule could be complex, involving multiple steps or conditions.
    *   **Generalization:** The model needs to generalize the rule to the test input, which might have different dimensions or arrangements.
    *   **Text Parsing/Representation:** Converting the text-based grid representation into a usable data structure (without brittle JSON parsing) is a challenge.
    *   **Computational Complexity:** Naive implementations of grid transformations can be computationally expensive, especially for larger grids.

*   **Edge Cases/Complexities:**

    *   **Empty Grids:** What happens when the input grid is empty or contains only zeros?
    *   **Varying Input Sizes:** How does the rule adapt when the input grid dimensions are significantly different from the training examples?
    *   **Multiple Transformations:** Can a single question involve both grid expansion *and* value modification?
    *   **Symmetry/Rotation:** Are there cases where the transformation involves rotation or reflection of the grid?
    *   **Color/Value Dependencies:** Does the transformation depend on specific color values or their relationships (e.g., "if a cell is surrounded by color X, change it to color Y")?

*   **Reasoning Requirements:**

    *   **Abstract Reasoning:**  Going beyond surface-level patterns to understand the underlying logic.
    *   **Analogical Reasoning:** Applying the transformation rule by analogy from the training examples to the test input.
    *   **Counterfactual Reasoning:**  Considering alternative transformations and evaluating their plausibility.

## POTENTIAL APPROACHES

*   **Solution Strategies:**

    1.  **LLM-Based Rule Extraction:**  Prompt the LLM to explicitly state the transformation rule based on the training examples.  Then, prompt it to apply that rule to the test input.
    2.  **Few-Shot Learning with Grid Representation:**  Represent the grid as a string with special markers for rows and cells. Construct a prompt that includes the training examples and the test input, and ask the LLM to generate the output grid directly.
    3.  **Hybrid Approach:** Use the LLM to analyze the training examples and identify key parameters of the transformation (e.g., expansion factor, color dependencies). Then, use a more programmatic approach (within the prompt itself using chain-of-thought) to apply the transformation to the test input.

*   **Decomposition:**

    1.  **Rule Identification:**  Focus on accurately identifying the transformation rule from the training examples.  This is the most critical step.
    2.  **Test Input Analysis:** Analyze the dimensions, color distribution, and spatial arrangements of the test input grid.
    3.  **Transformation Application:** Apply the identified rule to the test input, generating the output grid.
    4.  **Output Formatting:** Ensure the output grid is formatted correctly as a list of lists.

*   **Validation Techniques:**

    *   **Self-Consistency:**  Ask the LLM to explain its reasoning and justify the output.  Inconsistencies in the explanation can indicate errors.
    *   **Reverse Transformation:**  If possible, apply the *inverse* of the identified transformation to the output grid.  The result should resemble the original test input.
    *   **Example Augmentation:**  Generate additional training examples based on the identified rule.  Does the LLM's output align with these augmented examples?
    *   **Edge Case Testing:**  Create test inputs that represent edge cases and complexities (empty grids, varying sizes, etc.).  Does the LLM handle these cases correctly?

*   **Handling Unusual/Edge Cases:**

    *   **Rule Prioritization:** If multiple rules seem plausible, prioritize simpler rules or rules that are more consistent across training examples.
    *   **Default Behavior:** Define default behavior for edge cases (e.g., return an empty grid if the input is empty).
    *   **Error Reporting:** If the LLM is unable to identify a plausible rule or handle an edge case, provide a clear error message instead of a random output.

## CREATIVE INSIGHTS

*   **Non-Obvious Patterns/Shortcuts:**

    *   **Symmetry Exploitation:** If the input grids or transformations exhibit symmetry, exploit this to reduce the computational complexity.
    *   **Value Mapping:**  Instead of directly manipulating grid values, consider mapping them to a different range or representation that simplifies the transformation.
    *   **Incremental Transformation:**  Apply the transformation in small, incremental steps, visualizing the intermediate results to help debug.

*   **Unique Perspectives:**

    *   **Cellular Automata Analogy:**  Think of the grid as a cellular automaton, where each cell's state is updated based on the states of its neighbors.
    *   **Image Processing Analogy:**  Consider the grid as a low-resolution image, and apply image processing techniques (e.g., blurring, edge detection) to achieve the transformation.
    *   **Language Translation Analogy:**  View the transformation as translating the input grid from one "language" (pattern) to another.

*   **Analogies to Other Problem Domains:**

    *   **Code Refactoring:**  The process of identifying and applying a transformation rule is analogous to refactoring code – making changes to improve its structure and readability without changing its functionality.
    *   **Logic Puzzles:**  Many logic puzzles involve identifying and applying rules to a set of constraints.
    *   **Game Playing:**  The transformation rule can be viewed as a game-playing strategy, where the goal is to transform the input grid into a desired state.

## IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

*   **Verification Steps:**

    1.  **Rule Extraction Verification:**  Prompt the LLM to restate the extracted rule in multiple ways.  Compare these restatements for consistency.
    2.  **Output Verification:**  Ask the LLM to explain *why* each cell in the output grid has its specific value.  This helps identify errors in the transformation process.
    3.  **Visualization Verification:**  If possible, create a visual representation of the input and output grids to aid in debugging.

*   **Intermediate Steps/Representations:**

    1.  **Rule Representation:**  Represent the extracted transformation rule in a structured format (e.g., a dictionary or a set of rules).
    2.  **Grid Representation:**  Use a consistent string representation of the grid, such as comma separated values by row, that can be easily manipulated by the LLM. Avoid pure JSON.
    3.  **Intermediate Grid States:**  Store intermediate grid states during the transformation process to track the changes.

*   **Text-Based Techniques:**

    1.  **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:**  Guide the LLM through the transformation process step-by-step, asking it to explain its reasoning at each step.
    2.  **Role-Playing Prompting:**  Assign the LLM a specific role (e.g., "grid transformation expert") to encourage it to adopt a more methodical and accurate approach.
    3.  **Example Decomposition:**  Break down complex training examples into smaller, simpler examples to facilitate rule extraction.
    4.  **Iterative Refinement:**  Start with a simple transformation rule and iteratively refine it based on the LLM's feedback and the results of validation tests.
    5.  **Template-Based Generation:** Create a template with structured formatting, and ask the LLM to fill in the missing elements. This helps avoid code-related errors and ensures a consistent grid format.

By focusing on these techniques, you can leverage the LLM's reasoning abilities to solve grid transformation problems effectively, while minimizing the risk of errors associated with complex code generation and JSON parsing.

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            TOP PERFORMING APPROACHES TO BUILD UPON:
            
            

            PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED VARIATIONS:
            

            EXPLOITATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the error patterns, targeted improvements, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. CRITICAL: Break down the problem into distinct reasoning steps before modifying code
            3. CRITICAL: Analyze the best scripts to identify which components are working well and which are failing. Focus your improvements on the weak points while preserving successful components.
            4. Maintain the core successful elements of the best approaches
            5. Consider how you can combine strengths from multiple top-performing approaches
            6. CRITICAL: Add EMBEDDED EXAMPLES to EVERY LLM prompt that illustrate:
               - Sample input that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            7. Focus on fixing specific issues identified in previous error analyses. Create an explicit HYPOTHESIS for each targeted improvement, as well as a way to verify if it's successful.
            8. Enhance chain-of-thought reasoning and verification steps. Verification steps should be added to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            9. Apply the key insights from ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS to enhance the approach
            10. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment

            IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
            Analyze why the top approaches succeeded where others failed. Identify the key differentiators and strengthen them further.

            SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT APPROACH:
            1. First, identify which specific function or component is underperforming based on error analysis
            2. Examine how error cases differ from successful cases
            3. For each identified weakness, implement a targeted enhancement
            4. Add additional verification steps around modified components
            5. Consider how components interact - ensure improvements don't break successful parts

            Consider enhancing the script with one or more of these patterns:
            - Repeated validation with feedback loops
            - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
            - Dynamic input-dependent routing
            - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
            - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
            - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
            - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLOITATION phase:
            - Build upon what's working well in the best approaches
            - Consider creative combinations of successful techniques from different scripts
            - Make TARGETED improvements to address specific error patterns
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply the knowledge from our accumulated learnings
            - Significantly enhance the script to address weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your improvements
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

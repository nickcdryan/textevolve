    Input Text:
    The company XYZ Corp reported quarterly earnings of $3.5 million, which represents a 12% increase from last year. The CEO, Jane Smith, attributed this growth to their new product line launched in March, which has already captured 8% of the market share. They expect to expand their operations to Europe by Q2 2023.
    
    Let's think step by step.
    
    The key entities are:
    - XYZ Corp (company)
    - Jane Smith (person, CEO)
    - New product line (product)
    
    The key information points are:
    - Financial: Quarterly earnings of $3.5 million
    - Performance: 12% increase from previous year
    - Product: New product line launched in March
    - Market: 8% market share for new product
    - Plans: Expansion to Europe by Q2 2023

    Example usage:
    
    Problem:
    Design a data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:
    1. Insert a value
    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.

    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓
    2. Delete operation: The solution uses the hashmap to find the index, then swaps with the last element and updates accordingly with O(1) time complexity ✓
    3. Get random operation: The solution generates a random index within the array bounds with O(1) time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return {
                "is_valid": False,
                "validation_feedback": "Failed to extract valid entities after multiple attempts."
            }
        ```

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

        

            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        === INITIAL DATASET ANALYSIS [2025-05-09 05:21:32] ===

    Okay, I've analyzed the provided dataset of grid transformation tasks and have identified key patterns, challenges, and potential solution approaches. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

## DATASET CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Patterns in Questions:**
    *   The questions consistently present a "Grid Transformation Task."
    *   They include multiple training examples, clearly labeled.
    *   Each example shows an "Input Grid" and a corresponding "Output Grid."
    *   The format of the grids is consistently a 2D array (list of lists).
    *   A "TEST INPUT" grid is provided, requiring transformation.
    *   The description are very detailed and follow a consistent format.

*   **Patterns in Answers:**
    *   Answers are always a 2D array (list of lists), representing the transformed grid.
    *   The answer corresponds directly to the "TEST INPUT" grid from the question.

*   **Structure and Format:**
    *   **Input:**  Questions are text-based descriptions of grid transformation problems.  The key information is the "Input Grid", "Output Grid" examples, and the "TEST INPUT" grid. The grid itself is represented as a string that *could* be parsed into a 2D array.
    *   **Output:** Answers are strings representing the transformed grid in a 2D array format.
    *   **Grids:** The grids always contain numerical values.

*   **Domain Knowledge:**
    *   Basic understanding of 2D arrays (matrices).
    *   Pattern recognition skills (critical).
    *   Spatial reasoning (how elements relate to each other within the grid).

*   **Question Types:**
    *   All questions belong to the same general type: "Grid Transformation".  However, the *specific transformation rules* vary significantly between questions.

*   **Reasoning Types:**
    *   **Inductive Reasoning:**  Identifying the transformation rule from the training examples. This is the dominant reasoning type.
    *   **Spatial Reasoning:** Applying the rule correctly based on the positions of elements within the grid.
    *   **Logical Deduction:**  Applying the deduced rule to the test input.

## DATA CHALLENGES

*   **Difficulty:**
    *   **Abstract Rule Extraction:** The core challenge is to accurately identify the underlying rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. The rules are *implicit* and must be inferred from limited examples.
    *   **Rule Complexity:** The transformations can be complex and non-obvious, involving scaling, shifting, element replacement, or combinations of these.
    *   **Generalization:**  Ensuring that the inferred rule generalizes correctly to the test input, even if it differs slightly from the training examples.
    *   **Limited Examples:**  Only a few training examples are provided, which may not fully cover all aspects of the transformation rule.

*   **Edge Cases and Complexities:**
    *   **Multiple Possible Rules:** There might be multiple rules that fit the training examples. Choosing the "correct" one (that generalizes to the test input) is crucial.
    *   **Asymmetrical Transformations:** The transformation might not be symmetrical (e.g., rows are treated differently than columns).
    *   **Conditional Transformations:** The transformation might depend on the value of neighboring cells.
    *   **Value-Dependent Transformations:** The transformation may depend on the specific values within the grid (e.g., a '0' might be treated differently from a '1').
    *   **Size Changes:** While less frequent in the examples, transformations *could* potentially involve changing the grid size (adding or removing rows/columns).

*   **Reasoning Required:**
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying repeating patterns in the input and output grids.
    *   **Rule Induction:** Formulating a general rule that explains the transformations.
    *   **Spatial Context:** Understanding how the rule applies based on the location of elements within the grid.
    *   **Logical Application:**  Applying the inferred rule systematically to the test input.

## POTENTIAL APPROACHES

*   **Solution Strategies:**
    1.  **Rule Extraction and Application:** The primary strategy is to extract the transformation rule from the training examples and then apply it to the test input.
    2.  **Pattern-Based Transformation:**  Identify specific patterns in the input and output grids and directly map those patterns to transformed patterns in the test input.
    3.  **Value-Based Transformation:**  Focus on how individual cell values change based on their neighbors or their position in the grid.

*   **Decomposition:**
    1.  **Analyze Training Examples:**  Carefully examine the input and output grids in the training examples to identify potential transformation rules.
    2.  **Rule Formulation:**  Express the transformation rule in a clear and concise manner.
    3.  **Test Input Transformation:**  Apply the formulated rule to the test input.
    4.  **Output Formatting:** Ensure the output is correctly formatted as a 2D array string.

*   **Validation:**
    *   **Back-Testing:** If possible, apply the inferred rule *backwards* to the output grid of a training example and see if it produces the original input grid.  This can help validate the rule.
    *   **Intermediate Grid Visualization:** Visualize the intermediate steps of the transformation to ensure they align with the expected behavior.
    *   **Manual Inspection:**  Manually check the transformed output against the training examples to ensure consistency.

*   **Handling Unusual/Edge Cases:**
    *   **Default Rules:** Define default rules to handle cases where the inferred rule doesn't directly apply.  For example, if a cell has no neighbors, use its original value.
    *   **Iterative Refinement:** If the initial transformation produces an incorrect result, iteratively refine the rule based on the observed errors.

## CREATIVE INSIGHTS

*   **Non-Obvious Patterns/Shortcuts:**
    *   **Difference Grids:** Calculate the difference between the input and output grids.  This can sometimes reveal a simpler, underlying pattern.
    *   **Symmetry Analysis:** Check for symmetry in the input and output grids.  Symmetrical transformations are often easier to identify.
    *   **Value Frequency:** Analyze the frequency of different values in the input and output grids. This might reveal which values are being transformed into others.
*   **Unique Perspectives:**
    *   **Treat Grids as Images:** Consider applying image processing techniques (e.g., edge detection, blurring) to identify patterns in the grids.
*   **Analogies:**
    *   **Cellular Automata:** The grid transformations can be seen as a form of cellular automata, where the state of a cell is updated based on its neighbors.

## IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

*   **Verification Steps:**
    1.  **Rule Consistency:** Verify that the inferred rule is consistent across all training examples.
    2.  **Output Validation:**  Manually validate the transformed output against the training examples to ensure it follows the expected pattern.
    3.  **Boundary Condition Checks:**  Specifically check how the rule applies to cells at the edges of the grid.

*   **Intermediate Steps/Representations:**
    1.  **Rule Representation:**  Represent the inferred transformation rule in a structured way (e.g., using a dictionary or a set of rules).
    2.  **Difference Grids:** Create difference grids to highlight the changes between input and output grids.
    3.  **Neighbor Analysis:**  Identify the neighbors of each cell and store their values in a structured format.

*   **Text-Based Techniques for LLMs:**
    *   **Focus on Descriptive Rule Generation:** Instead of trying to generate code, have the LLM *describe* the transformation rule in natural language.  For example: "Each '1' is replaced by a '2'.  Each '0' remains a '0'."  Or, "Each cell takes on the value of its most frequent neighbor."
    *   **Few-Shot Learning with Detailed Explanations:** Provide several training examples, but *also include a textual explanation* of the rule being applied in each example. This can significantly improve the LLM's ability to generalize.
    *   **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Encourage the LLM to explain its reasoning step-by-step.  For example: "First, I identify the rule from the training examples.  Then, I apply that rule to each cell in the test input."
    *   **Iterative Refinement Loop:**  If the initial output is incorrect, prompt the LLM to analyze the errors and refine its rule.  Provide feedback by pointing out specific cells that were transformed incorrectly.
    *   **Avoid Direct Code Generation:**  Avoid prompting the LLM to directly generate code (e.g., Python) to perform the grid transformation. This often leads to syntax errors and incorrect logic. Instead, leverage the LLM's ability to reason in natural language and apply the rule step-by-step. *Use the LLM to think, not to code.*
    *   **Controlled Vocabulary:** Define a controlled vocabulary for describing grid operations. For example: "replace", "shift", "copy", "reflect", "invert", "neighbor", "adjacent", "row", "column". Using a controlled vocabulary can help the LLM generate more consistent and predictable descriptions.
    *   **Example Output Formatting:** Clearly specify the desired output format in the prompt. For example: "The output should be a Python list of lists, representing the transformed grid." Also, make sure to include the expected format in the few-shot examples.

By focusing on descriptive rule generation, few-shot learning with explanations, and chain-of-thought prompting, you can leverage the LLM's natural reasoning abilities to solve these grid transformation tasks without relying on complex code generation, which is more prone to errors. The key is to make the LLM *think* about the rule and apply it logically, rather than trying to program the transformation directly.

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            TOP PERFORMING APPROACHES TO BUILD UPON:
            
            

            PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED VARIATIONS:
            

            EXPLOITATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the error patterns, targeted improvements, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. CRITICAL: Break down the problem into distinct reasoning steps before modifying code
            3. CRITICAL: Analyze the best scripts to identify which components are working well and which are failing. Focus your improvements on the weak points while preserving successful components.
            4. Maintain the core successful elements of the best approaches
            5. Consider how you can combine strengths from multiple top-performing approaches
            6. CRITICAL: Add EMBEDDED EXAMPLES to EVERY LLM prompt that illustrate:
               - Sample input that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            7. Focus on fixing specific issues identified in previous error analyses. Create an explicit HYPOTHESIS for each targeted improvement, as well as a way to verify if it's successful.
            8. Enhance chain-of-thought reasoning and verification steps. Verification steps should be added to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            9. Apply the key insights from ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS to enhance the approach
            10. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment

            IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
            Analyze why the top approaches succeeded where others failed. Identify the key differentiators and strengthen them further.

            SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT APPROACH:
            1. First, identify which specific function or component is underperforming based on error analysis
            2. Examine how error cases differ from successful cases
            3. For each identified weakness, implement a targeted enhancement
            4. Add additional verification steps around modified components
            5. Consider how components interact - ensure improvements don't break successful parts

            Consider enhancing the script with one or more of these patterns:
            - Repeated validation with feedback loops
            - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
            - Dynamic input-dependent routing
            - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
            - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
            - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
            - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLOITATION phase:
            - Build upon what's working well in the best approaches
            - Consider creative combinations of successful techniques from different scripts
            - Make TARGETED improvements to address specific error patterns
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply the knowledge from our accumulated learnings
            - Significantly enhance the script to address weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your improvements
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

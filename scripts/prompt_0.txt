            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

With the win, the Texans improved to 4-0 for the first time in franchise history. On the opening drive of the game, Matt Schuab threw an 11-yard touchdown to make it 7-0. 2 drives later, Arian Foster scored a touchdown of 4 yards to make it 14-0 at the end of the first. Tennessee got going in the second with a 19-yard touchdown making it 14-7. That was the score at the half. In the third Matt Hasselbeck dropped back but was picked of by Danieal Manning and returned for a touchdown making it 21-7. On Houston's next drive, Schuab threw a 28-yard touchdown to Owen Daniels to make it 28-7 at the end of the third. In the fourth Tennessee fumbled giving it to Houston who took a 31-7 lead. Tennessee then threw an interception returned 63 yards for a touchdown. It was 38-7.

    Design a data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:

    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓
    2. Delete operation: The solution uses the hashmap to find the index, then swaps with the last element and updates accordingly with O(1) time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return solution_result["solution"]

        def extract_entities_with_verification(question, max_attempts=3):
            #Extract entities and verify their validity with feedback loop.
            system_instruction = "You are an expert at extracting and validating entities."

            for attempt in range(max_attempts):
                # First attempt at extraction
                extraction_prompt = f'''
                Extract key entities from this question. 
                Return a JSON object with the extracted entities.

                    2. No irrelevant entities are included
                    3. All entity values are correct

                    return data

                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error in extraction/validation (attempt {attempt+1}/{max_attempts}): {str(e)}")

            }
        ```

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

        === INITIAL DATASET ANALYSIS [2025-05-19 14:27:04] ===

    Okay, I've analyzed the provided dataset examples. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

## DATASET CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Patterns in the Questions:**
    *   Each question is presented as a `PASSAGE:\n... \n\nQUESTION: ...`. This structure clearly separates the context from the query.
    *   The passages primarily consist of narratives describing sports games or, in one case, demographic data.
    *   Questions are primarily about extracting specific facts, performing simple calculations, or drawing comparisons based on the provided passage.
    *   There's a focus on scores, player actions (touchdowns, field goals), and quantitative data.
    *   The questions often involve temporal aspects (e.g., "final touchdown," "first field goal").

*   **Patterns in the Answers:**
    *   Answers are concise and factual, directly extracted or derived from the passage.
    *   Answers are often proper nouns (player names) or numerical values (counts, yardage).
    *   Answer format is consistent with the type of information requested (e.g., a player's name for "Who caught the final touchdown?").

*   **Structure and Format:**
    *   **Input:** JSON format with fields "id," "question," and "answer."  The "question" field contains the passage and the actual question, separated by newline characters.
    *   **Output:**  The desired output is a string representing the answer to the question.

*   **Domain Knowledge:**
    *   Basic understanding of American football (scoring, positions, terminology).
    *   General knowledge of statistics (for the fertility rate example).
    *   The ability to interpret temporal and causal relationships within a narrative.

*   **Question Types:**
    *   **Fact Extraction:**  "Who caught the final touchdown of the game?"
    *   **Counting:** "How many running backs ran for a touchdown?"
    *   **Calculation:** "How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?"
    *   **Comparison/Difference:** "How many more TFR did Malays have in 2004 compared to Ethnic Chinese TFR in 2004?"

*   **Reasoning Types:**
    *   **Textual Reasoning:** Understanding the sequence of events in the passage.
    *   **Quantitative Reasoning:** Performing arithmetic operations.
    *   **Logical Reasoning:**  Drawing inferences based on the passage.

## DATA CHALLENGES

*   **Difficulty:**
    *   **Ambiguity:** The passage might contain similar information or names, requiring careful disambiguation.
    *   **Incomplete Information:**  The answer might need to be inferred based on multiple pieces of information.
    *   **Arithmetic Errors:**  Calculations introduce the possibility of mistakes.
    *   **Contextual Understanding:** Correctly interpreting the relationships between different events in the passage.

*   **Edge Cases/Complexities:**
    *   **Synonyms and Paraphrasing:** The question might use different wording than the passage.
    *   **Multiple Occurrences:** An event (e.g., a touchdown) might occur multiple times; the question could be specific about which occurrence to consider (e.g., "first," "last").
    *   **Negation:**  Questions like "Who did *not* score a touchdown?"
    *   **Units:** Need to be aware of units when performing calculations (yards, points, etc.)

*   **Reasoning Types Required:**
    *   **Coreference Resolution:** Determining which entities are being referred to throughout the passage.
    *   **Temporal Reasoning:** Understanding the order of events.
    *   **Arithmetic Reasoning:** Performing calculations.
    *   **Deductive Reasoning:**  Drawing conclusions based on the given information.

## POTENTIAL APPROACHES

*   **Solution Strategies:**
    1.  **Information Retrieval & Extraction:**
        *   Identify the question type.
        *   Use the question to guide the extraction of relevant sentences or phrases from the passage.
        *   Extract the specific entities or values mentioned in the question from the identified text.
        *   If necessary, perform calculations on the extracted values.
    2.  **Direct Answer Generation:**
        *   Frame the problem as a direct question-answering task.
        *   Prompt the LLM to directly generate the answer based on the passage.
        *   This can work well with a well-tuned LLM.

*   **Decomposition:**
    1.  **Question Understanding:** Analyze the question to determine its type (extraction, counting, calculation, comparison).
    2.  **Relevant Passage Identification:** Identify the sentences or phrases within the passage that are most likely to contain the answer. This could involve keyword matching or semantic similarity.
    3.  **Information Extraction/Calculation:** Extract the relevant information from the selected passage sections. If necessary, perform the required calculations.
    4.  **Answer Formatting:** Format the extracted or calculated information into the correct answer format.

*   **Validation:**
    *   **Self-Consistency:**  Check if the answer is consistent with the information in the passage.
    *   **Units Check:**  Ensure the answer has the correct units (e.g., "yards" for a distance).
    *   **Reasonableness Check:**  Check if the answer is within a plausible range (e.g., a player wouldn't score 100 touchdowns in a single game).

*   **Handling Edge Cases:**
    *   **Synonyms/Paraphrasing:** Use synonym expansion or semantic similarity to match question terms to passage terms.
    *   **Multiple Occurrences:** Use temporal reasoning (e.g., "first," "last") to select the correct occurrence.
    *   **Negation:**  Carefully handle negated questions by identifying the entities that *do not* satisfy the condition.

## CREATIVE INSIGHTS

*   **Non-Obvious Patterns:**
    *   The passage often presents information in chronological order. This could be leveraged for temporal reasoning.
    *   The structure of sports narratives is relatively predictable (e.g., scoring plays are often described in a consistent format).

*   **Unique Perspectives:**
    *   Frame the problem as a "story comprehension" task, where the LLM needs to understand the events in the passage to answer the question.
    *   Visualize the game or demographic data as a timeline or table to aid in reasoning.

*   **Analogies:**
    *   This problem is similar to information retrieval from a structured database, where the passage is the database and the question is the query.

## IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

*   **Verification Steps:**
    *   **Double-check extractions:** Validate that the extracted entities (names, numbers) are actually present in the identified passage sections.
    *   **Unit Consistency:** Before performing calculations, ensure that all values are in compatible units.
    *   **Answer Type Validation:** Validate the output answer has the expected type (e.g., number, name)

*   **Intermediate Steps:**
    *   **Passage Segmentation:** Break down the passage into sentences or phrases to facilitate targeted information extraction.
    *   **Dependency Parsing:** Use dependency parsing to understand the relationships between words in the passage.
    *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identify and classify named entities (people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.) in the passage.

*   **Text-Based Techniques (LLM-focused):**
    1.  **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Encourage the LLM to explicitly show its reasoning steps. This can improve accuracy and allow for debugging.
    Example:

    ```
    PASSAGE: ...

    QUESTION: How many yards did Chris Johnson's first touchdown and Jason Hanson's first field goal combine for?

    Let's think step by step:
    First, I need to identify Chris Johnson's first touchdown yardage. The passage says "Chris Johnson got a 6-yard TD run".
    Second, I need to identify Jason Hanson's first field goal yardage. The passage says "Jason Hanson getting a 53-yard field goal."
    Finally, I need to add those two numbers. 6 + 53 = 59.
    ANSWER: 59
    ```

    2.  **Few-Shot Learning:** Provide the LLM with a few examples of questions and answers to guide its reasoning.
    3.  **Answer Validation Prompt:** Use a separate prompt to validate the generated answer.  This prompt could ask the LLM to justify its answer based on the passage.
    4.  **Constrained Decoding:** If the answer is known to be a number, use constrained decoding to ensure that the LLM only generates numerical answers.

By following these recommendations, you can develop a more robust and accurate solution for this question-answering task. Remember that experimentation and iteration are crucial for achieving optimal performance. Good luck!

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

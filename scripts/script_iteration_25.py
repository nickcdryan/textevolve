# Hypothesis: Enhancing Fact-Checking with Multi-Agent Collaboration and Explicit Source Identification
# We will use multi-agent collaboration with explicit source identification for enhanced fact-checking and answer extraction.
# Specifically, we will introduce a "Source Verifier" agent that cross-references information from multiple sources
# and prioritizes answers based on source credibility. This approach aims to improve answer extraction and validation.

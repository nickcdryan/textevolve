Exploration: Visual Pattern Completion with Decomposition and Rule-Based Refinement

Hypothesis: Decomposing the grid transformation problem into stages of pattern identification,
rule construction, and visual pattern completion, followed by rule-based refinement will improve
performance. This leverages LLMs for complex pattern recognition, while implementing rule-based
verification steps to improve the chance that the result follows the rules.

The key change in this approach is the focus on visual pattern completion, instead of just code application,
as well as manual data handling to avoid parsing errors.

            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
            

            Here are example problems from previously seen data:

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Apply the transformations to the test input.",
  "Add print statements to the generated code to print intermediate outputs for each step, so you can better see how the data changes as its being processed. For example you could print(output_grid) inside of the loops where the transformations are happening.",
  "Use data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the system's ability to generalize. For grid problems, this could involve rotating, flipping, or scaling the grids.",
  "Add more diverse training data:**  Include a wider range of examples with varying grid sizes, element values, and transformation patterns.",
  "Use a symbolic reasoning approach:** Represent the grid transformations as symbolic expressions and use symbolic reasoning techniques to derive the correct transformation logic.",
  "Introduce a code verification step to ensure that the generated code aligns with the intended transformation logic. This could involve running the generated code on a small set of validation inputs and comparing the outputs with expected results.",
  "Focus on improving the system's understanding of spatial relationships and how these relationships can be represented in code. Consider using techniques like graph neural networks to model the grid structures and their transformations.",
  "Implement a more advanced pattern recognition algorithm capable of identifying complex relationships between input and output grids.",
  "Implement unit tests:**  Create a suite of unit tests to verify the correctness of the generated code for various scenarios.",
  "Implement a rule-based system:** Instead of generating code directly, first, extract the transformation rules into a structured format (e.g., a set of if-then rules). Then, use these rules to transform the input grid."

    Problem:
    Design a data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:
    1. Insert a value
    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓
    2. Delete operation: The solution uses the hashmap to find the index, then swaps with the last element and updates accordingly with O(1) time complexity ✓
    3. Get random operation: The solution generates a random index within the array bounds with O(1) time complexity ✓
    4. All operations have O(1) average time complexity ✓
    
    Result: VALID - The solution correctly addresses all requirements with the specified time complexity.

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"],

        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 7 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script solves grid transformation problems by analyzing visual features and applying transformations described in terms of these features. It uses a chain-of-thought approach where the problem is decomposed into analyzing visual features and applying a transformation. The agent roles involved are an expert at analyzing visual features and an expert at applying transformations. The function `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates the process, calling `analyze_visual_features` to get a transformation description, verifying it, and then using `apply_transformation` to generate the output. `call_llm` interfaces with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves analyzing the grid, describing the transformation, verifying the description, and finally applying the transformation to generate the output grid.

The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates these steps, while `call_llm` interacts with the Gemini LLM. The overall workflow involves first identifying the transformation type, then extracting parameters based on the type, and finally, generating the transformed grid using the extracted information.

Approach: The script solves grid transformation problems by independently analyzing row and column transformations using an LLM. The problem is decomposed into row-wise and column-wise analysis, with a fallback to analyzing the whole grid if necessary. The script uses specialized LLM agents with roles such as "expert at identifying row/column-based transformations" and "expert at applying transformations", and includes functions such as `analyze_row_transformations`, `analyze_column_transformations`, `analyze_whole_grid`, `combine_row_column_results`, `apply_row_transformation`, `apply_column_transformation`, and `call_llm`. The workflow involves analyzing rows and columns, combining their results, and falling back to analyzing the whole grid if row/column analysis fails, using the LLM to propose and validate transformations.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 4 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script uses LLM-based techniques to solve grid transformation problems by first extracting the transformation rule and then applying it to the test grid, using validation steps to ensure accuracy. The problem is decomposed into rule extraction and grid transformation, each with its own validation step. Two implicit agent roles are used: a grid transformation expert for rule extraction and a meticulous grid transformer for applying the rule. The function `call_llm` sends prompts to the LLM, `extract_transformation_with_validation` extracts the rule, `transform_grid_with_validation` applies the rule, `solve_grid_transformation` orchestrates rule extraction and grid transformation, and `main` serves as the entry point. The overall workflow involves extracting a transformation rule from training examples, validating the extracted rule, applying the rule to a test grid, and validating the transformed grid.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 3 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: This script solves grid transformation problems by first analyzing unique elements and their transformations using the `analyze_elements` function, which calls the LLM to infer element transformations and validate them. The `transform_grid` function then applies these transformations to the test input grid, also using the LLM with a validation step, followed by a final verification step using the `verify_output_grid` function, which validates using the LLM. The script uses a decomposition approach by focusing on individual element transformations, using agent roles for analysis, transformation, and verification, facilitated by the `call_llm` function. The overall workflow involves analyzing element transformations, applying them to the grid, and then verifying the result.

            LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, I've synthesized the existing research log with the new learnings from Iteration 7, focusing on concrete, task-specific insights for the Grid Transformation Task dataset. This updated log captures patterns, challenges, strategies, and findings specific to this dataset, designed for long-term memory and to avoid repeating past mistakes.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   **Question Format:** Tasks are presented as "Grid Transformation Tasks." Each task includes "TRAINING EXAMPLES" (input/output grid pairs) and a "TEST INPUT" grid. The objective is to generate the "OUTPUT GRID" for the test input, following patterns from the training examples.
*   **Consistent Structure:** Questions follow a consistent structure: a "Grid Transformation Task" header, "TRAINING EXAMPLES" with Input/Output grid pairs, a "TEST INPUT" grid, and an instruction to transform the test input.
*   **Grid Representation:** Grids are represented as nested lists of integers (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`). Grid dimensions (rows and columns) vary between examples and even within a single example (input vs. output). Grids are represented as nested lists of integers, primarily 0s and a few other single-digit numbers. The dimensions of the grids vary.
*   **Grid Structure and Values:** The dataset consists of grid transformation problems. The input and output grids are represented as nested lists of integers. The integers themselves represent cell states or values, often with '0' representing an empty or inactive state.
*   **Mixed Element Types:** Grids often contain a mix of elements, including zeros and other numerical values.
*   **Training Examples followed by Test Input:** Each problem is structured with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" showing input-output pairs, followed by a "TEST INPUT" for which the transformed grid must be generated.
*   **Transformation Logic:** The core challenge is identifying the transformation logic. This logic can involve:
    *   Expansion, substitution, mirroring, replication of rows/columns, shifting values, replacing values based on surrounding cells, and combinations of these.
    *   Spatial relationships between numbers (e.g., a cell's value depends on its neighbors). The rules are often *localized* to the vicinity of a cell.
    *   Numerical transformations (e.g., adding a constant to each cell).
    *   Combinations of spatial and numerical transformations. The transformations can be complex and context-dependent, applying differently based on the location or the neighboring elements of an element.
    *   Transformations can involve replacing elements with new values based on their original value and location, and introducing new non-zero values to previously zeroed cells.
    *   Transformations often involve changing specific numbers within the grid based on their position or surrounding numbers.
    *   Dimensionality changes are common between input and output grids, implying the system must infer resizing or cropping operations.
    *   Transformations often involve identifying specific numbers or patterns within the grid and then applying a change based on their location or relationship to other elements. The complexity lies in discerning the exact transformation rule from a limited number of examples.
*   **Implicit Rules:** Transformation logic is *never* explicitly stated. The LLM must infer the rules from limited training examples.
*   **Abstract Rules:** The underlying transformation rules are abstract and not immediately obvious. They can involve changes to specific numbers, their locations relative to other numbers, or based on other complex patterns in the grid. The challenges lie in deciphering abstract patterns and generalizing rules beyond the provided examples.
*   **Few-Shot Learning Format:** Questions are presented in a few-shot format, including multiple training examples (input/output grid pairs) followed by a test input grid. The task is to infer the transformation rule from the training examples and apply it to the test input. The success of this approach depends heavily on the quality and consistency of the training examples provided, including their ability to represent the transformation's logic within only a few samples.
*   **Varying Grid Sizes:** Transformations might be size-dependent.
*   **Multiple Possible Rules:** Different transformations might yield similar results on the training data but diverge on the test data.
*   **Value Dependencies:** A cell's new value may depend on multiple other cells.
*   **Asymmetric Transformations:** The transformation might not be symmetrical across the grid.
*   **Value Encoding:** Specific values within the grids (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9) have semantic meaning related to the transformation. The model must learn these encodings.
*   **Size and Dimensionality Reasoning:** The system struggles to infer the correct cropping or expansion rules when the sizes of the input and output grids vary considerably between the examples, leading to incorrect output dimensions. The system has difficulties understanding patterns with different sizes.

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   **Chain-of-Thought with Specialized Agents (Promising but Inconsistent):** The chain-of-thought approach, with specialized expert agents for visual feature analysis and transformation application, shows promise. The ability to decompose the problem into smaller, manageable steps is beneficial. However, this potential is not fully realized due to the LLM's issues with generalization. While the strategy aims for broad pattern discovery and demonstrates the ability to identify visual features, it often fails to connect them to the correct transformation logic, resulting in inconsistent performance. (Iteration 7)

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **Incorrect Pattern Generalization:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation patterns from the training examples. This leads to the application of incorrect rules to the test input. For example, it might misinterpret a spatial relationship or a value-based trigger for a transformation. *Example: All Iteration 0, Iteration 1, Iteration 2, Iteration 3, Iteration 4, Iteration 5, Iteration 6 and Iteration 7 errors.* The primary failure mode is the inability to generalize the transformation pattern from the training examples to the test input. The LLM often fails to correctly deduce the underlying logic, leading to the application of an incorrect transformation. For example, instead of correctly identifying the pattern of bordering specific numbers with other numbers it extracts a subgrid (Iteration 7).
*   **Pattern Generalization Failure:** The LLM fails to generalize the transformation logic from training examples to the test input. The generated output grids do not match the expected output grids. *Example: All Iteration 0, Iteration 1, Iteration 2, Iteration 3, Iteration 4, Iteration 5, Iteration 6 and Iteration 7 errors.* The LLM demonstrates *poor generalization* from the training examples, failing to extrapolate transformation rules when the test input differs even slightly from the training set.
*   **Inability to abstract general rules:** The model fails to generalize from the limited examples to novel test inputs. It appears to memorize patterns but struggles to understand the underlying logic of the transformations. *Example: struggles to apply a pattern observed in 3 training examples to a test grid that is a different size.*
*   **Dimensionality Mismatch:** The LLM generates output grids with incorrect dimensions compared to the expected output grid. This suggests a failure to understand how input grid dimensions influence output grid dimensions. *Example: Iteration 0, Example 2; Iteration 5, Example 1.*
*   **Shape and Dimensionality Errors:** The generated output grids often have incorrect shapes or dimensions compared to the expected output. This indicates a failure in understanding how the transformations affect the overall grid structure, or simply a failure in array construction in the generation stage.
*   **Incorrect Value Mapping:** Even when the dimensions are correct, the LLM fails to map values correctly. The numerical relationships between corresponding cells in the input and output grids are not accurately learned and applied. *Example: Iteration 0, Example 3; Iteration 5, Examples 2 and 3.*
*   **Value Errors:** The system generates grids containing numbers not present in the target grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** The LLM outputs the response as a string containing Python code that *would* define the output grid, rather than directly outputting the grid. This indicates a potential confusion between generating code and generating the desired output directly. *Example: Iteration 0, Examples 2 and 3.*
*   **Ambiguity:** The transformations are implicit and can be interpreted in multiple ways from just a few examples.
*   **Complexity:** The underlying transformations might be complex involving combinations of replication, shifting, value changes, and so on.
*   **Inability to Extract Accurate Transformation Rules:** The system consistently fails to extract accurate and generalizable transformation rules from the training examples. The LLM struggles to understand the underlying logic and often generates rules that are either too specific to the training examples or simply incorrect.
    *   *Example:* "The transformation rule is as follows: All numbers except '5' are replaced based on their position in the grid. The grid is divided into three horizontal sections separated by the rows of '5's. In the top section, all numbers except '5' are replaced with '2'. In the middle section, all numbers except '5' are replaced with '4'. In the bottom section, all numbers except '5' are replaced with '6'. The number '5' remains unchanged." This shows an attempt at pattern recognition, but the rule oversimplifies the transformation and doesn't account for variations within the sections.
*   **Fragility of Pattern Recognition:** The system's pattern recognition approach is fragile and easily disrupted by small variations in the input grids. It relies on specific conditional logic that does not generalize well to unseen data.
*   **Lack of Rule Validation:** The system's rule validation process is not robust enough to catch inaccurate or incomplete rules. Even with validation, the system often proceeds with flawed rules, leading to incorrect outputs. In many failure cases, the validation process itself fails, with rules being accepted and applied despite being inaccurate.
*   **Localized Contextual Analysis Insufficient:** The LLM struggles to generalize even seemingly simple local rules across the entire grid. The approach is not complex enough to capture the subtle pattern transformations. The system struggles with problems requiring *contextual transformations* – where the transformation rule depends on the element's position within the grid or its neighboring elements. The system simplifies transformation rules, leading to incorrect outputs.
*   **Oversimplification of Transformations:** The LLM tends to oversimplify the transformation rules, leading to incorrect outputs. For example, in one failure, the correct solution requires inserting "4" or "7" in specific locations relative to the original elements, but the system fails to correctly place these new values in the correct contextual positions.
*   **Complex Rule Interpretation:** The system struggles when the transformation involves multiple intertwined rules. For example, a combination of mirroring *and* value substitution is missed because the model focuses on one rule at a time.
*   **Incomplete Generalization:** The model fails to accurately generalize rules based on limited examples. Even seemingly simple patterns like repeating a grid or substituting values based on row/column parity are often misinterpreted or partially implemented.
*   **In-place vs. New Object Confusion:** The model is getting confused with modifying the input grid vs. creating a new output grid.
*   **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** In cases where the transformation involves mirroring, the implemented logic is sometimes flawed, leading to incorrect placements of mirrored elements or unintended modifications.
*    **Positional Transformation Neglect:** The system is unable to accurately capture how the grid modifies elements and their positions to produce the result. This reveals a pattern that simple value replacements can not solve the overall grid transformation.
*   **Difficulty with complex value dependencies:** The model struggles when the transformation relies on complex combinations or relationships between different values in the grid. *Example: When the test grid contains more values than the training grids, the system fails to follow the rules or even recognize those values.*
*   **Misinterpretation of spatial relationships:** The model incorrectly interprets how objects and values in the grid are spatially related and how these relationships change during the transformation.
*   **Misinterpretation of Visual Features:** The `analyze_visual_features` step is prone to misinterpreting the key visual features of the grid. This misinterpretation then leads to an incorrect transformation description, causing the `apply_transformation` step to generate a wrong output. (Iteration 7)

**4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS**

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Direct pattern matching would be more effective than explicit rule extraction.
    *   **Approach:** "Ensemble" approach - generate multiple plausible grids and select the best.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00. The LLM is unable to reliably infer and apply complex spatial and numerical transformations from a small number of training examples.
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis is rejected. The "ensemble" approach is not effective without a robust pattern recognition capability.
*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Explicitly prompting the LLM to extract and validate transformation rules will improve performance.
    *   **Approach:** Prompt the LLM to extract a transformation rule, then validate it, then apply it.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00. The LLM continues to struggle with identifying and representing complex transformation rules, even with explicit guidance and validation steps.
    *   **Finding:** Explicit rule extraction alone is insufficient. Validation alone isn't sufficient to overcome issues in rule extraction.
*   **Iteration 2:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Localized contextual analysis of the grid transformations will improve the accuracy. Focus on how the immediate neighbors of a cell influence its transformation.
    *   **Approach:** Prompt the LLM to analyze the training examples by focusing on the immediate context (neighbors) of each cell in the grid. The LLM will then generate a transformation rule based on these localized relationships and apply it to the test input.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that focusing on localized contextual analysis would be sufficient for solving grid transformation problems is **rejected**.
*   **Iteration 3:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Breaking down the grid transformation into individual element transformations is a sufficient approach.
    *   **Approach:** Adapt `analyze_elements` to transform each element separately based on the other training input/output pairs.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The experiment rejects the hypothesis that breaking down the grid transformation into individual element transformations is a sufficient approach for this dataset, due to the contextual relationships between the grid elements. The system's inability to capture these dependencies led to a complete failure (0% accuracy). The reliance on LLM calls for analysis, transformation, and verification may be too brittle. The LLM struggles with accurately inferring and validating complex transformation rules, even with agent roles defined.
*   **Iteration 4:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Extracting and applying rules with validation will improve performance.
    *   **Approach:** Use implicit agent roles for rule extraction and grid transformation.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00
    *   **Finding:** The "extraction and application with validation" strategy failed to achieve any accuracy. The implicit agent roles for rule extraction and grid transformation were not effective. Complex visual pattern recognition requires more robust techniques than the current LLM-based extraction and application approach. Validation steps failed due to difficulty of LLM in correctly identifying transformation rules and thus the transformed grid.
*   **Iteration 5:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Decomposing the problem into row and column analysis would simplify pattern recognition.
    *   **Approach:** Independently analyze rows and columns, combined with LLM-based transformation.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that decomposing the problem into row and column analysis would simplify the pattern recognition was rejected. The complexity of inferring transformations and dimensionality changes from the training data requires a more holistic approach. The LLM role assignment may not be optimal for the transformation tasks, given the complete failure.
*   **Iteration 6:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Hierarchical decomposition would improve performance by first identifying the overall transformation type, then extracting specific parameters, and finally applying the transformation.
    *   **Approach:** Use hierarchical decomposition: (1) Identify Transformation Type (2) Extract Transformation Parameters (3) Apply the transformation
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00
    *   **Finding:** The attempt to improve grid transformation problems using the LLM by identifying the overall transformation type, then extracting specific parameters, and finally applying the transformation alone did not solve the underlying inability to generalize from training examples.
*   **Iteration 7:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Describing transformations in terms of visual features will improve generalization.
    *   **Approach:** Use chain-of-thought with specialized expert agents for visual feature analysis and transformation application.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.33.
    *   **Finding:** The exploration strategy, while aiming for broad pattern discovery, currently yields low accuracy (0.33). The core hypothesis of describing transformations in terms of visual features to improve generalization is only partially supported. The system can identify visual features, but often fails to connect them to the correct transformation logic.

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

*   **Improve Pattern Recognition:** Enhance the `analyze_visual_features` function to better recognize and categorize different types of grid transformation patterns. This may involve incorporating techniques like edge detection, shape recognition, and pattern matching algorithms.
*   **Refine Transformation Descriptions:** Develop a more structured and precise language for describing grid transformations. This language should explicitly capture relationships between grid elements, spatial arrangements, and transformation rules.
*   **Focus on Size and Dimensionality Reasoning:** Explicitly incorporate size and dimensionality reasoning into the transformation logic. Develop strategies for handling cases where the input and output grids have different dimensions.
*   **Introduce Verification Mechanisms:** Implement more robust verification mechanisms to validate the transformation description before applying it to the test input. This may involve using the LLM to generate intermediate grids or to explain the reasoning behind the transformation.
*   **Fine-tune LLM Prompts:** Carefully refine the prompts used for `call_llm` to provide more context and guidance to the LLM. This may involve providing more detailed examples, clarifying the expected output format, and explicitly stating the constraints of the task.
*   **Implement a Dimension Inference Module:** Develop a module that explicitly infers the dimensions of the output grid based on the training examples before attempting value transformations. This could involve analyzing the relative sizes of input and output grids in the training set.
*   **Train for positional reasoning**: It's not enough to know what values to change. The system must reason about *where* to change them. It should be trained with examples that emphasize this.
*   **Rethink the LLM Agent Roles:** Re-evaluate the roles of the LLM agents. Instead of specialized row/column analysis, focus on an agent that can analyze the entire grid and propose transformations considering both value changes and dimension adjustments.
*   **Incorporate Validation Steps:** Add validation steps to ensure the generated output grid adheres to patterns observed in the training examples, such as value distributions and dimension ratios.
*   **Consider a Hybrid Approach:** Explore a hybrid approach that combines LLM-based reasoning with traditional image processing techniques for feature extraction and pattern recognition, potentially improving the accuracy of transformation rule inference.
*   **Focus on Rule Decomposition:** Explicitly decompose the transformation rule into smaller, more manageable sub-rules. For example, if the rule involves expansion and substitution, treat these as separate steps.
*   **Implement a More Structured Validation Process:** Develop a more rigorous validation process that checks for specific aspects of the transformation, such as element counts and row/column patterns.
*   **Explore Explicit Coordinate-Based Rules:** Shift the representation of rules to be more explicit about coordinates.
*   **Generate More Diverse Training Data:** Consider augmenting the training dataset with examples that cover a wider range of transformation types and complexities. Focus on generating examples that test specific aspects of the transformation logic.
*   **Add unit tests:** Add unit tests for `transform_grid` function.
*   **Improve Pattern Recognition:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to explicitly identify and represent recurring patterns in the training examples. This could involve techniques like identifying motifs or common local transformations.
    *   Experiment with different LLM prompting strategies to encourage more accurate pattern identification.
*   **Enhance Shape and Dimensionality Control:**
    *   Implement checks to ensure that the generated output grid has the correct shape and dimensions.
    *   Consider using a more structured output format to make it easier to enforce these constraints.
*   **Refine Local Context Analysis:**
    *   Increase the size of the "local context" window to capture dependencies on more distant cells.
    *   Add a mechanism to identify and prioritize the most relevant contextual factors for each cell.
*   **Explore Hybrid Approaches:**
    *   Combine the LLM-based approach with more traditional algorithms for pattern recognition and grid manipulation. This could involve using the LLM to generate candidate transformations, and then using algorithms to verify and refine these transformations.
*   **Enhance Rule Extraction with Visual and Spatial Reasoning:** Given the visual nature of the grid transformations, explore approaches that explicitly incorporate visual and spatial reasoning capabilities. This could involve:
    *   *Incorporating computer vision techniques* to analyze the grids and identify relevant patterns.
    *   *Designing prompts that explicitly encourage the LLM to think about spatial relationships* between elements in the grid.
*   **Improve Rule Validation with Counterexamples:** Strengthen the rule validation process by generating counterexamples. After extracting a rule, the system should attempt to create input grids that would lead to incorrect outputs if the rule were applied. If such counterexamples are found, the rule should be rejected or refined.
*   **Iterative Refinement of Rules:** Implement an iterative refinement process where the system generates an initial rule, applies it to a subset of the training examples, and then analyzes the results to identify areas where the rule fails. This information can then be used to refine the rule and repeat the process.
*   **Break Down the Problem into Simpler Sub-Problems:** Instead of attempting to extract the entire transformation rule at once, break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. For example, the system could first try to identify which elements in the grid are changing and then focus on the rules governing those changes.
*   **Explore Alternative Model Architectures:** Experiment with model architectures that are better suited for visual reasoning tasks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers. These models may be able to learn the underlying patterns in the grids more effectively than a standard LLM.
*   **Improve Pattern Extraction:**
    *   Refine the prompt to encourage more accurate pattern extraction.
    *   Experiment with different prompt structures.
    *   Include more explicit guidance on identifying relationships between input and output grids (e.g., "Look for patterns involving cell coordinates," or "Describe the transformation in terms of mathematical operations").
*   **Focus on Dimensionality:**
    *   Add constraints to the prompt to ensure the generated output grid has the correct dimensions.
    *   Provide examples of how input grid dimensions relate to output grid dimensions in the training data.
*   **Explicit Rule Extraction:**
    *   Explore a hybrid approach that combines pattern matching with explicit rule extraction.
    *   Have the LLM first attempt to identify explicit rules (e.g., "If a cell in the input grid is X, the corresponding cell in the output grid is Y") before generating candidate output grids.
*   **Few-Shot Learning with Augmented Examples:**
    *   Increase the number of training examples to provide more context for the LLM.
    *   Generate synthetic examples covering a wider range of transformations.
*   **Output Formatting Constraint:**
    *   Explicitly instruct the LLM to output ONLY the grid as a nested list of lists, without any surrounding text, code blocks, or explanations. This will prevent the "code generation" failure mode.
*   **Transformation Rule Validation:**
    *   Crucially, the LLM needs to *explicitly state* the transformation rule in a human-readable way. This allows for verification and debugging.
*   **Output Grid Verification:**
    *   Check that the output grid has the expected dimensions and that the values are within the valid range.
*   **Intermediate Representations:**
    *   A clear, natural language description of the inferred transformation is critical. This serves as an interpretable intermediate representation. Example: "Each number in the input grid is replaced with a 3x3 block of the same number."
*   **Template-Based Generation:**
    *   Use templates to guide the LLM in generating the output grid. For example, if the LLM determines that the grid is expanded by a factor of 3, use a template to generate the expanded grid with placeholders for the values, and then fill in the values based on the inferred transformation. This reduces the risk of formatting errors.
*   **Adapt `analyze_elements`:** Adapt the `analyze_elements` function to consider the *position and neighborhood* of each element. Instead of just focusing on unique element transformations, incorporate spatial context into the analysis.
*   **Handle Complex Transformations:** The system needs to be able to handle *complex transformations* rules beyond single element changes. The transformations need to model the element-wise changes and consider context.
*   **Improve Generalization:** Explore strategies for *improving generalization*. One approach would be to augment the training data with variations of the existing examples, forcing the model to learn more robust transformation rules. Another would be to provide richer contextual information to the LLM during the analysis and transformation steps.
*   **Replace LLM Calls:** Consider replacing the LLM calls in verification and transformation with a more reliable function based on the context.
*   **Implement a mechanism for learning explicit transformation rules:** Augment the model with a module that can explicitly represent and reason about transformation rules extracted from training examples. This could involve using techniques like program synthesis or rule induction.
*   **Incorporate spatial reasoning capabilities:** Enhance the model with mechanisms for understanding and manipulating spatial relationships within the grid. This could involve using convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks.
*   **Explore data augmentation techniques:** Generate synthetic training examples that cover a wider range of possible transformations and grid configurations to improve the model's generalization ability.
*   **Improve the prompt design:** Explicitly ask the LLM to explain the rules of the transformations. This might help the LLM to be more clear, and therefore more accurate, in its predictions.

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

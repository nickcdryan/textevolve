            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
            

            Here are example problems from previously seen data:

]

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Constraint Extraction and Encoding:** Implement a mechanism to explicitly extract and encode constraints from the training examples. These constraints could be represented as rules or logical expressions that guide the transformation process.",
  "Intermediate Step Analysis:** Add print statements to show intermediate outputs so the reasoning path can be traced later.",
  "Review Code for Common Errors:** Before executing the code, have the system review it for common errors, such as incorrect loop conditions, off-by-one errors, and incorrect indexing.",
  "Enhanced Pattern Recognition Algorithms:** Experiment with more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms, such as those based on convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks, which are better suited for capturing spatial relationships and complex dependencies in grid data.",
  "Introduce Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests for individual code components, especially those dealing with spatial relationships (e.g., a function that checks for adjacent cells). These tests can help verify the correctness of these components in isolation.",
  "Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data with variations of the existing examples to improve the system's ability to generalize to unseen inputs. This could involve adding noise, rotating the grids, or changing the values of certain elements.",
  "Attention Mechanisms:** Incorporate attention mechanisms that allow the system to focus on the most relevant parts of the input grid when applying transformations. This can help to avoid overgeneralization and ensure that transformations are applied in the correct locations.",
  "Implement a Code Debugger:** Integrate a simple code debugger into the system. This would allow the system to step through the generated code, inspect variable values, and identify the exact point where the execution diverges from the intended behavior.",
  "Implement Pattern Decomposition:** Break down complex patterns into simpler, more manageable sub-patterns. This can make it easier to generate code for each sub-pattern and then combine the resulting code to form a complete solution.",
  "Enhance Spatial Reasoning:** Improve the system's ability to reason about spatial relationships. This might involve using a specialized spatial reasoning library or developing a more robust representation of spatial information."

    # Example: Combining Multiple Patterns for Advanced Problem Solving

    ## Original Challenge
    Creating a system that can analyze complex text, identify key insights, and generate well-reasoned recommendations.

    ## Pattern Selection and Combination Strategy

    1. Start with Feature Extraction to identify key elements:
    ```python
    # Extract key information from input text
    extraction_prompt = f'''
    Analyze this text and extract key features:

    {input_text}

    Focus specifically on:
    - Main entities and their attributes
    - Relationships between entities
    - Explicit and implicit constraints
    - Quantitative data points
    - Key objectives and success criteria

    For each feature, explain why it's significant for the analysis.
    '''

    extracted_features = call_llm(extraction_prompt, system_instruction="You are a precise information extraction specialist.")
    ```

    2. Apply Multi-Perspective Analysis with domain experts:
    ```python
    # Generate analyses from different expert perspectives
    perspectives = ["data_analyst", "domain_expert", "strategic_advisor"]
    perspective_analyses = []

    for perspective in perspectives:
        perspective_prompt = f'''
        As a {perspective}, analyze this situation:

        Input text: {input_text}

        Key features identified:
        {extracted_features}

        Provide a thorough analysis focusing on aspects a {perspective} would prioritize.
        Highlight insights that might be missed by other perspectives.

    # Synthesize the perspectives
    synthesis_prompt = f'''
    Combine these different expert analyses into a comprehensive understanding:

    {json.dumps(perspective_analyses, indent=2)}

    Identify:
    - Where the perspectives agree and disagree
    - Complementary insights that build on each other
    - Points of tension that require further investigation

    Create a unified analysis that leverages the strengths of each perspective.
    '''

    3. Implement Chain-of-Thought with Self-Consistency:
    ```python
    # Generate multiple reasoning chains toward recommendations
    reasoning_paths = []

    for i in range(3):  # Generate 3 different reasoning paths
        reasoning_prompt = f'''

        {unified_analysis}

        Think step-by-step toward recommendation{i+1}.
        Focus on a different priority or approach than previous reasoning paths.

        Step 1: Identify key challenges and opportunities
        Step 2: Evaluate potential approaches
        Step 3: Consider implementation requirements
        Step 4: Assess risks and mitigations
        Step 5: Develop specific recommendations

    final_versions.sort(key=lambda x: x["total_score"], reverse=True)
    best_version = final_versions[0]["version"]
    ```

    ## Key Integration Points
    - Feature Extraction provides structured input for Multi-Perspective Analysis
    - Multi-Perspective Analysis feeds unified context to Chain-of-Thought
    - Self-Consistency ensures robustness of reasoning paths
    - Debate and Verification rigorously test and improve recommendations
    - Best-of-N Selection optimizes the final output format and content

    ## Benefits of Pattern Combination
    - Each pattern addresses different aspects of the complex problem
    - Later patterns build upon the outputs of earlier patterns
    - Verification catches issues that might be missed in a linear approach
    - Multiple perspectives create more robust solutions
    - Self-consistency reduces likelihood of spurious reasoning

    This example demonstrates how combining patterns creates a solution pipeline that's much more powerful than any single pattern alone, particularly for complex analytical and recommendation tasks.

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
           - If verification fails, send the output back into an earlier part of the pipeline with specific feedback from the error
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return solution_result["solution"]



        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step: this will help us debug
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails
        6. Crucially, verification should be used to catch errors in the processing pipeline and feed them back into an earlier part of the pipeline for refinement with feedback for a set number of attempts. Verification for its own sake isn't very helpful, especially as the final step.

Approach: The script uses the Gemini LLM for solving grid transformation problems through direct pattern matching, enhanced by few-shot examples within a detailed prompt. The problem is decomposed by framing it as a pattern recognition task, where the LLM acts as a pattern expert. The `call_llm` function sends prompts to the Gemini model, and the `solve_grid_transformation` function constructs the prompt with examples and calls the LLM. `main` calls `solve_grid_transformation` to get the answer. The overall workflow involves creating a detailed prompt with examples, sending it to the LLM, and returning the LLM's generated grid transformation.

    You are an expert at recognizing patterns in grid transformations. Given training examples
    and a test input, transform the test input according to the learned pattern. Focus on spatial relationships.
    The output should be a transformed grid, formatted as a list of lists.
    Here are multiple examples of grid transformations that showcase step-by-step transformation reasoning.

    Example 1:
    Input Grid:
    [[0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7]]
    Reasoning: The input is expanded. 0 becomes [0,0,0]. 7 becomes [7,7]. Each row is similarly repeated, expanding the grid.
    Output Grid:
    [[0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7]]

    Example 2:
    Input Grid:
    [[4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0]]
    Reasoning: The input grid is expanded following a specific pattern. Each '4' becomes '[4,0,4]', and each '0' becomes '[0,0,0]'. The same expansion logic occurs from columns to rows.
    Output Grid:
    [[4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

    Example 3:
    Input Grid:
    [[0, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9], [0, 0, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0], [9, 0, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 9, 0, 0], [0, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9]]
    Reasoning: 1 is kept and is converted to [0, 8, 8]. The rest of the numbers become [0,0,0] or [8,0,0] based on 9s and 0s. The pattern appears to occur such that only 1 numbers are kept from each grid and the rest of the locations in the grid become 0 or 8.
    Output Grid:
    [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,8,8],[0,0,0]]

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 6 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script solves grid transformation problems by identifying and applying local structural motifs using an LLM. It decomposes the problem into motif extraction, transformation analysis, and application of the transformation to the test grid. Three agent roles are involved: grid analyst, grid transformer, and grid format verifier. The functions `extract_motifs_and_transformations` analyzes the question and calls the LLM to identify motifs and their transformations, `apply_motif_transformation` uses the LLM to apply the transformations to the input grid based on the motif analysis, and `verify_output_format` uses the LLM to verifies the format of the generated grid. The overall workflow involves extracting the test input, analyzing motifs, applying transformations, verifying the output format, and returning the transformed grid.

This script introduces a novel approach to solving grid transformation problems

image processing techniques that look for recurring patterns to transform and clean up images.

Hypothesis: Identifying repeating sub-structures ("motifs") in the input grid and mapping their
transformation to the output grid can provide a robust way to generalize transformations, even
with limited examples. This approach seeks to go beyond simple pattern matching by understanding
the relationship between these motifs and their transformations.

This script attempts a new approach:
1. Motifs are recognized as repeating subgrids.
2. The relationship between these motifs across training examples are analyzed to
deduce transformations.
3. A 'transformation' in this sense means the relationship between a subgrid and its new version in the ouptut grids.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 4 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script addresses grid transformation problems using an LLM with a chain-of-thought approach, incorporating rule extraction, application, and a verification loop. The problem is decomposed into extracting examples/test input, extracting a transformation rule based on positional reasoning, applying the rule, and verifying the output. The agent acts as a rule extractor, transformer, and verifier. The core functions used are `call_llm`, which interfaces with the Gemini model, and `solve_grid_transformation`, which orchestrates the extraction, transformation, and verification steps. The `solve_grid_transformation` function calls `call_llm` multiple times to extract information, derive the transformation rule, apply the rule, and verify the result, refining the rule based on verification feedback in a loop.

This script explores a new approach to grid transformation problems by using a 
combination of LLM-driven rule extraction with explicit positional reasoning and a verification loop.

Hypothesis: By explicitly representing positional information (row, col) in the LLM prompts and 
using a verification loop with feedback, we can improve the accuracy of rule extraction 
and application in grid transformation problems. This approach aims to address the LLM's
difficulty in reasoning about spatial relationships and ensure the transformations are applied 
consistently across the grid.

# GRID TRANSFORMATION DATASET - RESEARCH LOG

This document serves as a running log of our learnings and experiments related to the grid transformation task. It focuses on concrete, dataset-specific insights and findings, rather than general system design principles.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Grid Representation:** Grids are represented as lists of lists, with integer values representing colors/states.
*   **Value Range:** Values in grids tend to be small integers (0-9). Often these are binary grids or low integers reflecting the repetition.
*   **Grid Structure and Zero-Padding:** Questions consistently present grid transformation problems using 2D lists (matrices) filled predominantly with zeros and a few other integers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9). The large proportion of zeros often forms a "padding" or background, while the non-zero integers represent the "foreground" elements undergoing transformation. This suggests that the *relative position of non-zero elements within a sparse grid* is crucial for identifying transformation rules.
*   **Question Structure:** Questions are formatted as a series of "Example Input Grid," "Example Output Grid" pairs, followed by a "Test Input" grid and the instruction to transform the test input. Each example is clearly labeled ("Example 1:", "Example 2:", etc.). Questions consistently follow a "TRAINING EXAMPLES ... TEST INPUT ... Transform the test input" structure.
*   **Multi-Example Prompting Format:** Questions are formatted with "=== TRAINING EXAMPLES ===" followed by multiple "Example X: Input Grid:\n[...]\nOutput Grid:\n[...]" pairs. Then, "=== TEST INPUT ===\n[...]" and the prompt "Transform the test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples." This highlights the task's reliance on *few-shot learning*. The system's performance is directly tied to its ability to discern and generalize transformation rules from a small number of examples.
*   **Grid Dimensions:** The size of the input grids varies across examples within a single question. Within a single question, input and output grids may have consistent dimensions, but there is often some padding present. The answer grid's size is determined by the transformation pattern, and is not always the same as the input grid. Sizes range from small 3x3 grids to larger 21x21 grids.
*   **Transformation Focus:** Questions focus on spatial relationships and transformations of the grid's contents.
*   **Question Types:**
    *   **Grid Expansion/Replication:** The input grid is expanded into a larger grid, with values replicated based on the original pattern (e.g., Example 0 from initial analysis).
    *   **Conditional Value Modification:** Values within the grid are changed based on their position or the values of their neighbors (e.g., Examples 1, 2, 3, 4 from initial analysis).
    *   **Resizing/Reshaping:** Grid structure changes size or shape.
    *   Combinations of the above are possible.
*   **Grid Structure and Repetition:** A key characteristic is the consistent presence of repeating patterns within these grids (rows, columns, or sub-grids with identical values). The training examples are crucial for demonstrating these patterns. Grids are frequently framed by a border of identical numbers.
*   **Transformation Logic Encoding:** The transformation logic is encoded implicitly within the relationship between the input and output grids of the training examples. This logic often involves identifying specific numbers or patterns in the input and replacing them with other numbers in predictable locations within the output grid.
*   **Transformation Logic Variety:** The transformation logic itself varies significantly between problems within the dataset. Some transformations involve propagating values to neighbors, others involve repeating columns, and still others might extract subgrids based on patterns found within the non-zero elements. This *diversity of transformation types* poses a significant challenge for a simple pattern matching approach, as a single, universal strategy is unlikely to succeed across the entire dataset. Transformations can be complex, involving changes to element values based on their position, neighboring values, or other intricate relationships. This complexity is dataset-specific; success relies on uncovering these non-obvious rules.
*   **Multi-Example Dependency:** Successfully extracting the transformation rule relies heavily on multiple training examples. A single example is often insufficient to disambiguate the underlying pattern.
*   **Fill Patterns:** Many examples require a "fill" pattern, or reflecting values found in the input grid throughout the output grid with a certain symmetry.
*   **Spatial Transformations:** The transformation rules are spatial and involve manipulations of numbers within the grid based on their positions and values of neighboring cells.
*   **Limited Symbol Variety:** The grids use a limited set of symbols (integers, primarily), but the spatial arrangement and relationships between them are key.
*   **Core Transformation Logic:** The core challenge revolves around deciphering the transformation logic. This could involve shrinking/expanding the grid, changing values based on neighbors, or applying other spatial relationships.
*   **Local and Structural Transformations:** The transformations are often *local* and *structural*. That is to say that the correct answer can be obtained by observing local pattern changes.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

**Ineffective Strategies:**

*   **Purely LLM-Driven Pattern Matching:** Relying solely on the LLM to directly learn and apply the transformation rules has proven unreliable. (See Experiment Log - Iteration 0). Demonstrated again in Iteration 1, 2, and 7 with 0% accuracy.
*   **Multi-Example Prompting Alone:** Simply providing multiple examples in the prompt is not enough to solve the grid transformation problems reliably. The LLM, in its current form, lacks the capability to robustly extract and implement the correct transformation logic. (See Experiment Log - Iteration 2).
*   **Test-Time Training:** The "test-time training" approach, which relies on the LLM to develop and validate a hypothesis before applying it, was unsuccessful for this dataset. (See Experiment Log - Iteration 3).
*   **Explicit Positional Reasoning with Verification Loop:** Explicit positional reasoning, combined with a verification loop and feedback mechanism, has not improved accuracy. This suggests the LLM cannot effectively correlate errors with the extracted rule and adjust its reasoning accordingly (Iteration 4).
*   **Unconstrained Exploration Strategy:** A broad, unconstrained exploration strategy is not effective at solving the core transformation challenges without better constraints. (See Experiment Log - Iteration 5).
*   **Local Structural Motif Identification and Application (Iteration 6):** The approach of identifying and applying "local structural motifs" completely failed for this dataset, resulting in 0.0 accuracy. The hypothesis that identifying motifs and mapping their transformation provides a robust way to generalize transformations was rejected.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Pattern Extraction Failure:** The core failure lies in the LLM's inability to accurately extract and generalize the transformation pattern from the training examples. The model generates outputs drastically different from the expected golden answers. For instance, it produces simple diagonal matrices when a complex grid transformation is required. For example, given the training examples:
    ```
    === TRAINING EXAMPLES === Example 1:
    Input Grid:
    [[3, 1, 2],
     [3, 1, 2],
     [3, 1, 2]]

    Output Grid:
    [[4, 5, 6],
     [4, 5, 6],
     [4, 5, 6]]

    Example 2:
    Input Grid:
    [[2, 3, 8],
     [2, 3, 8],
     [2, 3, 8]]

    Output Grid:
    [[6, 4, 9],
     [6, 4, 9],
     [6, 4, 9]]

    Example 3:
    Input Grid:
    [[5, 8, 6],
     [5, 8, 6],
     [5, 8, 6]]

    Output Grid:
    [[1, 9, 2],
     [1, 9, 2],
     [1, 9, 2]]

    Example 4:
    Input Grid:
    [[9, 4, 2],
     [9, 4, 2],
     [9, 4, 2]]

    Output Grid:
    [[8, 3, 6],
     [8, 3, 6],
     [8, 3, 6]]

    === TEST INPUT ===
    [[8, 1, 3],
     [8, 1, 3],
     [8, 1, 3]]

    Transform the test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples.
    ```
    The expected output is "[[9,5,4],[9,5,4],[9,5,4]]" but the LLM often returns a diagonal matrix or other incorrect output.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Deduction:** The LLM fails to generalize the transformation rule from the examples. Instead of identifying the core transformation logic, the model focuses on superficial correlations or repetitions.
*   **Inability to Handle Complex Rules:** The model struggles with transformations that involve more than simple element-wise operations or direct spatial relationships. Examples with more intricate patterns result in incorrect outputs.
*   **Sensitivity to Noise:** The model is susceptible to "noise" in the examples.
*   **Ambiguity:** The training examples might not perfectly define the transformation. There could be multiple plausible rules.
*   **Generalization:** The model needs to generalize the rule to the test input, which might have different dimensions or arrangements.
*   **Text Parsing/Representation:** Converting the text-based grid representation into a usable data structure (without brittle JSON parsing) is a challenge.
*   **Computational Complexity:** Naive implementations of grid transformations can be computationally expensive, especially for larger grids.
*   **Edge Cases/Complexities:**
    *   **Empty Grids:** What happens when the input grid is empty or contains only zeros?
    *   **Varying Input Sizes:** How does the rule adapt when the input grid dimensions are significantly different from the training examples?
    *   **Multiple Transformations:** Can a single question involve both grid expansion *and* value modification?
    *   **Symmetry/Rotation:** Are there cases where the transformation involves rotation or reflection of the grid?
    *   **Color/Value Dependencies:** Does the transformation depend on specific color values or their relationships (e.g., "if a cell is surrounded by color X, change it to color Y")?
*   **Incorrect Value Substitution:** The LLM struggles to correctly identify *which* values need to be substituted and *what* they should be replaced with. For instance, it might misinterpret the training examples and apply a substitution rule to the wrong numbers, leading to incorrect values in the output grid.
*   **Extrapolation and Dimensionality Errors:** The LLM incorrectly extrapolated patterns in the training data, generating larger grids than expected in the test output. This indicates a failure to respect dimensionality constraints.
*   **Lack of Contextual Awareness:** The LLM failed to account for context within the grid. For example, the examples above show a test input that differs from the training examples. The LLM failed to generalize between these scenarios.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Recognition from Limited Examples:** The primary failure mode stems from the LLM's inability to accurately deduce the underlying transformation rule from the few provided training examples. For instance, the model misinterpreting the transformation logic, failing to propagate non-zero values to the correct neighboring locations. This indicates a limitation in the LLM's *reasoning and generalization abilities* when faced with complex spatial relationships.
*   **Incorrect Code Translation of (Misunderstood) Patterns:** Even when the LLM identifies a plausible pattern, it often struggles to translate this understanding into correct and executable code. The generated code inaccurately implements the intended neighbor propagation logic, yielding an incorrect output grid. This highlights a disconnect between *pattern recognition and procedural implementation.*
*   **Sensitivity to Grid Dimensions and Element Distribution:** The transformations appear to be sensitive to specific grid dimensions and the spatial arrangement of non-zero elements. The system incorrectly repeats column values across the grid, misinterpreting the rule based on the distribution of values within the provided examples. This suggests a need for *robust strategies that are invariant to irrelevant grid properties.*
*   **Pattern Recognition is a Bottleneck:** The failure to accurately identify the transformation pattern is a significant bottleneck. Even when the model attempts to generate code based on a (flawed) understanding of the pattern, the resulting output is incorrect. The ability of LLMs to do pattern matching on complex inputs is suspect.
*   **Grid Size Discrepancy:** The LLM sometimes fails to produce an output grid of the same dimensions as the expected output. This suggests an issue with understanding or adhering to the grid structure. This is exemplified in the case where the system outputs a 3x3 matrix while the golden answer is a 21x21 matrix.
*   **Ignoring Input Data:** The LLM-generated responses often bear little to no resemblance to the input grids, indicating that the model is not effectively utilizing the provided information to guide its transformations.
*   **Hallucination:** The LLM outputs grids that have nothing to do with the original input, suggesting the LLM hallucinates or has problems with reasoning.
*   **Incorrect Rule Extraction (Iteration 4):** The LLM struggles to extract accurate transformation rules from the training examples. The agent fails to generalize and capture the underlying logic of the grid transformations. For example, when presented with a fill grid, the LLM misinterpreted what values to fill and where, leading to an empty grid or seemingly random numbers in the output.
*   **Positional Reasoning Errors (Iteration 4):** Positional reasoning alone is not enough to ensure accurate transformations. The positional reasoning approach does not prevent the LLM from making errors in applying rules based on the positions of numbers in the grid.
*   **Verification Loop Ineffectiveness (Iteration 4):** The verification loop does not effectively refine the extracted rules, indicating that the feedback mechanism is not sufficient to correct the LLM's errors. The LLM lacks the capacity to correlate the error with the rule and adjust accordingly.
*   **Unreliable String to Integer Conversion (Iteration 5):** The system fails when it cannot reliably convert string representations of grid values into integers. This suggests the LLM sometimes introduces formatting issues or unexpected characters when extracting cell values or transformation rules.
*   **Reasoning Errors About Grid Transformations (Iteration 5):** The model struggles to derive the correct transformation rules from the training examples, leading to either incorrect output grids or an "Invalid transformation" error, indicating the system couldn't determine a consistent rule.
*   **Cell-by-cell Approach Bottleneck (Iteration 5):** Relying directly on the LLM for both cell analysis and transformation without proper validation/filtering leads to inconsistencies.
*   **Inability to Abstract Transformation Logic (Iteration 6):** The LLM struggles to go beyond superficial pattern matching to extract the underlying *logic* behind the grid transformations. For example, it might recognize that a '1' in the input leads to a row of '1's in the output, but fail to understand *why* or *where* that row should be placed relative to the input grid.
*   **Motif Extraction Ambiguity (Iteration 6):** The LLM fails to identify the relevant motifs in the training examples and how these motifs are transformed to generate the output grid. This causes it to apply the wrong transformations to the test input, resulting in a completely different matrix. For example, it may identify a motif, but the transformation rule applied is wrong (it might assume a number changes to a "3", when that is incorrect).
*   **Output Shape/Dimensionality Errors (Iteration 6)**: The generated output grids often have a different shape or dimensionality than the expected output. This indicates a fundamental failure in understanding how the transformation affects the overall structure of the grid, not just the values within it.
*   **Spatial Relationship Misinterpretation (Iteration 7):** The LLM struggles to accurately translate spatial relationships between grid elements into code. For example, identifying that 2s must appear to the left and above 1s, but failing to implement code to generate 2s in all necessary places.
*   **Pattern Generalization Failure (Iteration 7):** The LLM struggles to generalize patterns observed in training examples to the test input grid. For example, the LLM fails to identify how the values in the test grid should be transformed by incorrectly identifying "the value 3 as a key".
*   **Output Grid Structure Problems (Iteration 7):** LLM fails to recognize changes to the overall structure in the transformed grid (e.g., changes to grid size).

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   **Approach:** Purely LLM-driven pattern matching using the Gemini model. Prompt focused on providing examples and asking the LLM to generate the output.
    *   **Result:** 33% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The Gemini model is insufficient for complex reasoning about abstract patterns in grid transformations. The hypothesis that an LLM can directly learn and apply these rules is rejected.
*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   **Approach:** LLM-driven rule extraction via `extract_transformation_rule` function, followed by application. Problem decomposition strategy attempted.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis that an LLM-driven rule extraction and application process can address grid transformation problems was not supported. The 0% accuracy indicates a fundamental inability to generalize from the training examples to the test input using the current strategy. The `extract_transformation_rule` function is ineffective.
*   **Iteration 2:**
    *   **Approach:** Multi-example prompting with code generation and validation.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The near-zero accuracy demonstrates that simply providing multiple examples in the prompt is not enough to solve the grid transformation problems reliably. The LLM, in its current form, lacks the capability to robustly extract and implement the correct transformation logic. The LLM's capability to do pattern matching on its own, without a human designed algorithm, appears to be extremely limited. Validation, while useful, cannot compensate for poor pattern recognition.
*   **Iteration 3:**
    *   **Approach:** "Test-time training". The LLM was prompted to develop and validate a hypothesis about the transformation rule based on the training examples, before applying it to the test input.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The results suggest that the complexity of the grid transformations and the need for precise pattern recognition are beyond the current capabilities of the LLM when using this specific "test-time training" strategy. The hypothesis that test time training would help in this approach is rejected.
*   **Iteration 4:**
    *   **Approach:** Explicit positional reasoning with a verification loop and feedback to refine extracted rules.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The LLM, despite incorporating explicit positional reasoning and a verification loop with feedback, cannot reliably solve grid transformation problems in this dataset. The hypothesis that this approach can improve accuracy is rejected.
*   **Iteration 5:**
    *   **Approach:** Exploration strategy with `analyze_cell_transformation` for cell-by-cell analysis.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The zero accuracy score for exploration suggests that while a broad, unconstrained approach may uncover interesting patterns, it's not effective at solving the core transformation challenges without better constraints and validation. The cell-by-cell analysis approach needs a more reliable way to determine cell values. Relying directly on the LLM for both analysis and transformation without proper validation/filtering leads to inconsistencies.
*   **Iteration 6:**
    *   **Approach:** Identification and application of "local structural motifs". Attempted to identify motifs and map their transformation, then apply that transformation to the test input.
    *   **Result:** 0.0 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that identifying motifs and mapping their transformation provides a robust way to generalize transformations was rejected.
*   **Iteration 7:**
    *   **Approach:** Direct pattern matching using the Gemini LLM, with few-shot examples in the prompt.
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The LLM can recognize simple patterns, but struggles with more complex spatial relationships or transformations requiring structural changes. The LLM's generated code often does not accurately reflect the identified patterns, leading to incorrect outputs. The approach of using the Gemini LLM for direct pattern matching in grid transformations, even with few-shot examples, results in 0.00 accuracy.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Refine Prompt Engineering:** Develop more precise prompts that guide the LLM to focus on specific spatial relationships (e.g., adjacency, relative position) and structural changes (e.g., resizing, reshaping) observed in the examples. Consider using more explicit instructions or constraints in the prompt.
*   **Implement a Two-Stage Process:** Decompose the problem into (1) pattern identification and (2) code generation. First, have the LLM explicitly describe the pattern, and then use that description to generate the transformation code. This could provide more transparency and control over the LLM's reasoning.
*   **Explore Data Augmentation:** Augment the training set with more diverse examples that cover a wider range of pattern types (e.g., resizing, rotation, reflection) and grid structures.
*   **Introduce Error Correction Mechanisms:** Implement mechanisms to detect and correct common errors in the generated code, such as incorrect indexing or boundary conditions.
*   **Improve Rule Extraction Prompts:** Design prompts that guide the LLM to focus on positional patterns and transformations more effectively. Experiment with different prompt formats and examples. This might include explicitly asking the LLM to identify the coordinate transformation being applied.
*   **Explore alternative verification mechanisms:** Instead of relying solely on the LLM for verification, integrate external functions that can perform basic checks on the transformed grid (e.g., verifying symmetry, checking for specific value distributions).
*   **Implement Data Augmentation:** Generate more training examples that cover a wider range of transformation rules and grid patterns to improve the LLM's ability to generalize.
*   **Constraint LLM's solution space:** Rather than generating the entire grid at once, try prompting the LLM to fill in one cell at a time, given its coordinates. Then introduce a specialized program to compile these outputs into a final grid.
*   **Simplify the Pattern Extraction Task:** Break down the pattern extraction process into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, prompt the LLM to first identify specific features or relationships within the input-output grid pairs before attempting to formulate a general transformation rule.
*   **Focus on Positional Logic:** The LLM needs to be better able to reason about positional relationships. Explicitly provide row/column information in prompts, or design prompts that specifically ask about how a cell's value changes based on its location.
*   **Explicit Constraints:** Reinforce constraints such as "the output grid must be the same size as the input grid" in the prompt. Also, experiment with providing the output grid dimensions separately to ensure the LLM is aware of the required output structure.
*   **Investigate alternative prompting strategies:** Rather than generating a hypothesis, explore few-shot prompting with more examples or chain-of-thought reasoning to guide the LLM through the transformation process step by step.
    *   **Implement a more structured approach to pattern extraction.** The LLM may be better used to *describe* the pattern that a more classical algorithm can leverage. Focus on prompt engineering to elicit specific details about the patterns observed in the examples.
*   **Augment LLM with Explicit Pattern Extraction:** Given the LLM's difficulty in directly inferring transformation rules, *explicitly extract and represent the transformation rules* in a more structured format before code generation. This might involve developing a separate module to analyze the input and output grids, identify key features (e.g., symmetry, repetition, propagation), and encode these features in a rule-based language.
*   **Introduce a Rule-Based Code Generation Module:** Instead of relying on the LLM to generate code from natural language, *develop a rule-based code generation module* that takes the structured representation of the transformation rule as input. This module could use predefined templates and algorithms to generate Python code that implements the specified transformation.
*   **Refine Validation with Transformation-Specific Checks:** Enhance the validation process by incorporating *transformation-specific checks*. For example, if the extracted rule involves propagating values to neighbors, the validation step should specifically verify that this propagation is correctly implemented in the output grid.
*   **Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.** Instead of directly predicting the output grid, decompose the transformation into steps. Experiment with prompts that ask the LLM to identify individual transformation steps (e.g., "What happens to cells with value X?").
*   **Augment the training examples with explicit explanations of the transformation rules.** This could help the LLM focus on the core logic. Example: Include text like "Rule: If a cell's neighbors are all 1, change the cell to 0." in the prompt.
*   **Experiment with other prompting strategies.** Explicitly ask the LLM to identify the transformation rule *before* generating the output grid. This may help improve the model's reasoning. The prompt could be structured as follows:
    1.  "Describe the transformation rule in the examples."
    2.  "Apply the rule to the test input."
*   **Explore hybrid approaches:** Combine the LLM with traditional algorithms for grid manipulation (e.g., using the LLM to identify parameters for a grid expansion algorithm).
*   **Develop a formal representation of transformation rules:** This could involve creating a domain-specific language (DSL) for describing grid transformations. The LLM could then be used to translate the examples into this DSL, and a separate engine could execute the DSL code.
*   **Investigate the use of visual representations:** Can visual aids (e.g., diagrams, animations) improve the LLM's ability to understand and apply the transformations? Consider adding visual elements to the prompt (if technically feasible).
*   **Improved Rule Extraction:** Investigate methods for improving rule extraction. This might involve few-shot learning, chain of thought reasoning, or other methods for structuring LLM prompts. A more explicit encoding of location could be useful (e.g., "replace value X at row Y, column Z with value W").
*   **Focus on Pattern Recognition:** The approach should be refined to explicitly focus on recognizing and replicating the repeating patterns observed in the training grids. This might involve incorporating techniques for detecting symmetry, identifying repeating sub-grids, or analyzing the frequency of specific values within the grid.
*   **Dimensionality Constraints:** Implement a mechanism to enforce dimensionality constraints. The system needs to ensure that the output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid (or a predictable transformation of the dimensions based on the training examples).
*   **Introduce Unit Tests:** The existing approach lacks unit tests. Create a set of test examples and evaluate each LLM function independently.
*   **Curriculum Learning:** Introduce a curriculum learning approach where the model is first trained on simpler transformations (e.g., simple column repetition) before moving on to more complex ones (e.g., transformations involving complex neighbor interactions).
*   **Consider a Hybrid Approach:** Investigate hybrid approaches that combine LLM-based reasoning with traditional computer vision techniques for feature extraction and pattern recognition. For example, computer vision algorithms could be used to detect symmetries or repetitive patterns in the grids, which could then be used to guide the LLM's code generation process.
*   **Consider hybrid approaches:** Investigate combining the LLM with more traditional grid processing techniques or algorithms to assist with pattern recognition and transformation.
*   **Strengthen Input Validation (Priority):** Prioritize robust input validation and error handling for grid values *before* passing them to the transformation logic. Implement checks to ensure extracted values are integers or can be reliably converted, with fallback mechanisms for invalid inputs (e.g., default values, error reporting).
*   **Improve Rule Extraction from Training Examples (Priority):** Enhance the `analyze_cell_transformation` function to more accurately extract and represent transformation rules. Instead of relying solely on the LLM, explore rule representation techniques (e.g., decision trees, mathematical expressions) that can be validated and applied consistently.
*   **Constrain LLM Output (Priority):** Experiment with techniques to constrain the LLM's output, such as providing predefined templates or formats for transformation rules. This can help reduce the risk of unpredictable or invalid outputs.
*   **Implement Post-Transformation Validation (Priority):** Add a "sanity check" function to validate the transformed grid against basic properties observed in the training examples (e.g., range of values, overall structure). This could help identify and correct errors before returning the final result.
*   **Refine Motif Definition and Extraction (Iteration 6):** Focus on *smaller*, more *localized* motifs. The LLM should identify patterns immediately surrounding non-zero elements.
*   **Implement Explicit Shape Constraints (Iteration 6):** Before generating the final grid, enforce constraints on the *output shape*. The code should explicitly calculate the expected dimensions of the output grid based on the training examples and ensure the generated grid adheres to these dimensions.
*   **Improve Transformation Representation (Iteration 6):** Experiment with alternative ways to represent the transformation rules extracted from the training examples. Rather than relying solely on the LLM to describe the transformations, explore using structured data (e.g., dictionaries mapping input motifs to output motifs with coordinate offsets).
*   **Few-shot prompting (Iteration 6):** Try using few shot prompting, where you provide several correct solutions for other problems, to help the LLM learn the pattern more clearly.
*   **Two-Stage Pattern Extraction and Code Generation (Iteration 7):** Decompose the problem into (1) pattern identification and (2) code generation. First, have the LLM explicitly describe the pattern, and then use that description to generate the transformation code. This could provide more transparency and control over the LLM's reasoning.

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

# Hypothesis: Implement a "Knowledge Retrieval with Targeted Validation" approach, focusing on improving answer accuracy by:
# 1. Generating multiple search queries based on different interpretations of the question.
# 2. Implementing targeted validation checks for each extracted answer.
# 3. Utilizing a validation agent that incorporates more comprehensive fact verification.
# Verification is implemented to deduce if the search queries and validation steps are helpful.

            You are improving a Python script that solves problems from a dataset.
            Your goal is to REFINE and ENHANCE the best performing approaches by combining their strengths and addressing specific weaknesses identified in error analysis.

            Here are example problems from previously seen data:
            [
  {
    "id": 0,
    "question": "In 1993, Vaughan Jones was elected to which academy?",
    "answer": " American Academy of Arts and Science."
  },

        PRIMARY ISSUES (last 3 iterations):
        [
  {
    "iteration": 0,
    "issue": "The single most critical problem is the **overly strict or flawed validation process.** The system rejects potentially correct answers, leading to a \"Could not be validated\" response even when a valid answer exists. This is likely due to a high confidence threshold for what constitutes a valid answer, incorrect logic in comparing retrieved information with the question's requirements, or an incomplete knowledge base."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 1,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's **lack of robust reasoning and inference capabilities when processing search results**. It needs to be able to synthesize information from multiple sources, resolve conflicts, and verify answers against a broader knowledge base or logic."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 2,
    "issue": "The single most critical problem is **inaccurate knowledge retrieval** leading to the generation of incorrect answers. This manifests in the system providing a different answer than the provided \"golden answer,\" which indicates an issue with the accuracy of the data the system accesses or the way it queries and interprets the data."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 3,
    "issue": "The single most critical problem to fix is the **ineffective information extraction**. The system's current approach is not successfully identifying and retrieving the answer from the context provided, leading to a consistent \"no answer\" response."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 4,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's passive behavior when faced with insufficient information. It needs to be augmented with the capability to actively seek out the necessary information via external knowledge sources (e.g., internet search). It needs a mechanism to detect if information is lacking, formulate a relevant query, retrieve information, extract the answer, and then respond to the original question."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 5,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the **inability to reliably retrieve and validate information from the knowledge source**. This leads to \"Could not be validated\" or \"Unavailable\" responses, hindering the system's ability to answer questions. The validation logic is likely too sensitive or the knowledge retrieval is inaccurate."
  }
]

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Develop a Confidence Scoring System:** Assign a confidence score to each answer based on the quality and reliability of the retrieved information. Only present answers with a high confidence score. If confidence is low, provide an \"I don't know\" response or flag the answer for human review.",
  "Implement More Detailed Logging:** Add logging to the information retrieval and validation components to track the search queries, retrieved information, and validation criteria. This will provide valuable insights into why the system is failing.",
  "Implement a Knowledge Graph:** Represent knowledge as a graph with entities and relationships. This can allow for more nuanced and context-aware information retrieval.",
  "Implement Error Feedback Loop:** When the system fails to validate an answer, implement a mechanism to analyze the failed query and automatically improve the knowledge retrieval process.",
  "Relax Validation Criteria (Cautiously):** Experiment with less strict validation criteria to reduce the number of false negatives. However, be careful not to introduce more incorrect answers.",
  "Implement a \"Source Tracking\" Mechanism:** Keep track of the sources used to generate each answer, and allow users to review these sources. This can help users evaluate the reliability of the answer.",
  "Implement a \"sanity check\" module to identify obviously incorrect or illogical answers.",
  "Improve Question Understanding:** Implement more sophisticated question understanding techniques, such as semantic parsing or dependency parsing, to extract the key entities and relations from the question.",
  "Refine Knowledge Base Indexing and Search:** Evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the knowledge base indexing and search mechanisms. Consider using techniques like semantic search or entity linking to improve retrieval performance.",
  "Implement External API Access:** Allow the system to access external APIs (e.g., Wikipedia, Google Search) to verify the accuracy of its answers and supplement its internal knowledge base."

    Design a data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:

    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓
    2. Delete operation: The solution uses the hashmap to find the index, then swaps with the last element and updates accordingly with O(1) time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return solution_result["solution"]

        def extract_entities_with_verification(question, max_attempts=3):
            #Extract entities and verify their validity with feedback loop.
            system_instruction = "You are an expert at extracting and validating entities."

            for attempt in range(max_attempts):

                    if verification_data.get("is_valid", False):

        ```

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

        

            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, here's the updated and synthesized version of our learnings, focusing specifically on the given dataset and task. This document will serve as our evolving research log.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Factual and Specific Questions:** Questions are factual and seek specific pieces of information across a wide range of topics (music, chemistry, oceanography, bands, television, technology, awards, and biological classifications).
*   **Emphasis on Proper Nouns and Named Entities:** Questions frequently contain proper nouns and specific dates, making them amenable to information retrieval. Answers are often short phrases, often consisting of one or a few proper nouns (names of people or things). Examples: "Who was the first cardiologist in Kashmir?" "Who murdered the supervillain Monsieur Mallah?", "Who was the lead programmer for Project Firebreak?". "Name of person awarded a specific prize in a specific year", "Genus transitions of a species". The questions often involve named entities (people, organizations, titles) that may have ambiguity or require precise matching in a knowledge base. The "James Vernon the Younger" example highlights the need to handle generational titles correctly.
*   **Explicit Named Entities:** Questions frequently focus on named entities like people, organizations (universities), and biological classifications (genus, species). The questions directly ask *for the name of* these things.
*   **Specific Year Requirements:** The dataset frequently requires identifying a specific year associated with an event or person (e.g., "In what year did Etta Cone last visit Europe?", "In which year was Jamini Roy awarded the Padma Bhushan?", "In 1993, Vaughan Jones was elected to which academy?"). This suggests a strong reliance on temporal reasoning and access to date-related information.
*   **"Which" Questions Targeting Specific Individuals/Entities:** Several questions begin with "Which" and seek a specific individual or entity associated with a particular role or accomplishment (e.g., "Which architect was tasked with finishing the chapel...?"). These questions require precise identification from a potentially large pool of candidates.
*   **Question Types:** Primarily fact-retrieval questions asking for specific details about people, places, or things ("Who...", "What...", "Name of...", "Which...").
*   **Need for Precise Factual Recall:** Questions require precise factual recall, often involving dates, numbers, or names (e.g., "Champions League semi-final match between Barcelona and Milan on April 27, 2006", "What month and year did Apple release the Hey Siri feature?").
*   **Contextual Specificity:** Questions often contain specific contextual details (e.g., "Champions League semi-final match between Barcelona and Milan on April 27, 2006") to narrow the scope of the answer.
*   **Information Extraction Task:** The dataset tests the ability to extract *very specific* pieces of information from potentially larger contexts. It's not simply about broad topic understanding.
*   **"Who" questions requiring specific names:** Many questions (e.g., "Who was the first cardiologist in Kashmir?") require identifying specific individuals, making accurate name retrieval crucial.
*   **Questions requiring temporal context:** Some questions ("What day did India land its first spacecraft on the moon?", "Before the New 52, who murdered the supervillain Monsieur Mallah?", "What month and year did Apple release the Hey Siri feature?", "In what year did Etta Cone last visit Europe?", "In which year was Jamini Roy awarded the Padma Bhushan?") involve temporal qualifiers. This demands understanding of historical or fictional timelines to extract correct information.
*   **Questions expecting definitive answers:** The questions expect precise answers (specific dates, names), not general descriptions or related concepts.
*   **Complex Factual Questions:** The dataset contains complex factual questions that often require multi-hop reasoning or accessing multiple pieces of information. This is evident in questions like the "Hey Siri" query, which requires understanding the feature and the company (Apple).
*   **Entity Specificity:** Many questions revolve around specific entities like people (e.g., "Anita Sandoval", "Bonnie Berger"), projects ("Project Firebreak"), awards ("ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award", "Paul Karrer Gold Medal"), and products ("Horizon Zero Dawn"). The correctness depends heavily on identifying these entities accurately.
*   **Temporal Reasoning:** Some questions (e.g., "Hey Siri" question, "In what year did Etta Cone last visit Europe?", "In which year was Jamini Roy awarded the Padma Bhushan?") require temporal reasoning, understanding dates, and relating events to specific time periods.
*   **Complex Question Structure:** The questions are fact-retrieval based but require understanding relationships and potentially hierarchical information (e.g., name of a person awarded a specific prize in a specific year, genus transitions of a species).
*   **Context Dependency:** The answers are not directly present in the question itself; they require accessing and processing external information (simulated knowledge base) and connecting it to the question terms.
*   **Assumed Prior Knowledge and Lack of Context:** The questions often assume background knowledge not explicitly stated in the question itself. The system is failing when the initial, limited context it constructs is insufficient to answer the question directly.
*   **Varied Answer Types:** The expected answers encompass different data types, including strings (names, academy titles) and numerical values (years), which necessitate a flexible validation approach.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Initial Attempts Ineffective:** The initial strategy of using an LLM for iterative refinement with a validation step resulted in 0% accuracy, indicating the need for significant improvements.
*   **Current Accuracy Very Low:** With an accuracy of 0.33 in experiment 1 and 0.00 in experiments 2, 3 & 5, no current strategies can be considered effectively "working". The underlying framework shows potential but requires significant refinement. The highest accuracy has been 0.33 (Experiment 1 and Experiment 4).
*   **RAG Framework Insufficient:** The initial hypothesis that a basic RAG framework with Gemini is sufficient for this task is rejected. The current implementation struggles to extract answers, even with explicit source citation and verification steps. The decomposition into multiple agents (query generation, extraction, verification) doesn't appear to be effective with the current implementation.
*   **Fact Verification Approach with Multi-Source Integration Needs Active Information Seeking**: The fact verification approach with multi-source integration shows promise, since it decomposes the problem into generating multiple search queries, simulating context retrieval from these queries while verifying their relevance, extracting answers from each context, synthesizing a final answer, and validating that final answer. However, this strategy needs an active information-seeking loop.
*   (Currently, no specific strategies are working, given the 0% accuracy in Experiment 5. This section remains largely blank, awaiting the identification of truly effective approaches.)

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Overly Strict Validation:** The primary failure mode is the "Could not be validated" response. This suggests the validation logic is too rigid.
    *   **Example:** The date question "Specify the day, month, and year..." could fail if the extracted answer includes the day of the week, even if the core date is correct. The "Hey Siri" question also resulted in "Could not be validated," indicating that the system failed to extract the correct month and year from its knowledge source. If the system retrieves "American Academy of Arts and Sciences" (plural) when the expected answer is "American Academy of Arts and Science" (singular), it fails validation.
*   **Validation Sensitivity:** The primary failure stems from over-sensitive validation logic. The system frequently reports "Could not be validated" even when the answer *might* be present but not in the exact expected format.
*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding During Validation:** The validator likely struggles to relate the retrieved information to the specific constraints in the question.
    *   **Example:** For the corner kicks question, the validator might not be able to verify that the retrieved number of corners specifically relates to the *Barcelona* team, the *Champions League* match, and the specified date.
*   **Dependency on Perfect Information Retrieval:** The system's reliance on simulated retrieval means a slightly off search query can lead to no relevant information, and thus, a validation failure even if the LLM could have reasoned with broader knowledge.
*   **Ambiguity:** A question might have multiple possible answers depending on context.
*   **Synonyms/Paraphrasing:** The answer might be expressed differently in the source text than in the question.
*   **Misspellings/Typos:** Both in the question and the potential answer source.
*   **Cultural References:** Some questions may rely on understanding cultural or historical context that is not explicitly stated.
*   **Multiple entities with the same name:** disambiguation may be necessary.
*   **UnboundLocalError:** Error detected during script repair (attempt 1): cannot access local variable 'extracted_answer' where it is not associated with a value. This highlights the need for robust error handling and ensuring variables are properly initialized.
*   **Inability to resolve conflicting information:** In the "first cardiologist" question, the LLM extracted "Dr. Sheikh Jalal" instead of the correct "Dr Upendra Kaul," indicating a failure in discerning accurate information from potentially conflicting (simulated) search results. The system needs a more robust method for selecting the correct answer when multiple possibilities are presented in the search context.
*   **Failure to identify the correct entity in search results:** For the "Monsieur Mallah" question, the system returned "Unknown from search result" when the correct answer was "Gorilla Grodd." This suggests the model struggled to extract the specific entity (Gorilla Grodd) related to the murder event from the provided context, even if the information was present in the simulated search results. This can be due to named entity recognition failure, relationship extraction failure, or even failures in question understanding. For the "Project Firebreak" question, the LLM returned "Naoya Oda" instead of "Anita Sandoval," indicating a failure to accurately link the project to the correct lead programmer.
*   **Poor Simulated Search Results:** The low accuracy (0.33 in experiment 1 and 0.00 in experiments 2, 3, & 5) reinforces the possibility that the simulated search results are not accurate or relevant enough, hindering both information extraction and validation.
*   **Inaccurate Entity Resolution:** The primary failure mode is the inability to resolve entities correctly. The "James Vernon the Younger" example highlights the need to handle generational titles correctly.
*   **Knowledge Graph Misidentification/Hallucination:** The "ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award" example showcases a failure to retrieve the correct information from the knowledge source. The LLM returns "Janet Thornton" instead of "Bonnie Berger," suggesting that either the lookup process is flawed, or the LLM is hallucinating information not present in the knowledge source.
*   **Information Extraction Bottleneck:** The primary failure mode is the inability of the system to extract the correct answer from the provided context. The LLM consistently returns "No answer can be extracted," even when the ground truth answer is present within the knowledge base. This suggests a problem with the *answer extraction* agent, rather than the *context query generation* agent.
*   **Lack of Understanding Contextual Relationships:** The error examples suggest the system struggles to identify and connect the relevant information from the context to the specific question. For example, identifying "Ada Yonath" as the recipient of a particular award in a given year requires understanding the relationship between the person, the award, and the year within the context.
*   **Potential impact of agent prompting**: The prompt to the extraction agent is likely not optimized for extracting the precise answer from the context.
*   **Information extraction as a critical failure point**: We've identified that information extraction specifically, rather than the RAG setup, is the point of failure.
*   **Insufficient Context Detection Failure:** The agent struggles when the initially retrieved context (simulated or otherwise) lacks the information required to answer the question. The system passively reports the inability to answer instead of actively seeking the missing information. This is especially evident in questions like "In what year did Etta Cone last visit Europe?" where the context doesn't contain the specific year.
*   **Passive Behavior Regarding Missing Information:** The system's most significant failure mode is its inability to actively address information gaps. Even with a decomposition strategy including search queries, it does not detect its own informational shortcomings and reformulate queries to fill those gaps. It simply gives up.
*   **Inaccurate Information Retrieval:** The "Unavailable" response in the Miss USA example suggests a failure in information retrieval. The system likely couldn't find the answer to this specific question, indicating potential gaps in the knowledge source or ineffective search queries.
*    **Lack of Numerical Precision:** The James Vernon example demonstrates a failure in matching numerical answers. The validation likely requires an exact string match, failing if there are any slight variations.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Experiment 0 (Initial Exploration):**
    *   **Strategy:** LLM-based iterative refinement with validation.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The initial configuration of prompts, validation logic, or information retrieval simulation is inadequate. The hypothesis that the LLM, with its inherent knowledge, can directly answer complex questions involving precise factual data and validation is rejected in its current form.
*   **Experiment 1 (Agent-based LLM Approach):**
    *   **Strategy:** Basic framework of information extraction, query generation, simulated search, answer extraction, and validation.
    *   **Result:** 0.33 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The agent-based LLM approach, in its current form, struggles with reasoning and information synthesis from (simulated) search results. The failure to accurately answer questions involving specific entities (names, dates) indicates a weakness in linking entities to the events described in the questions. This is the highest accuracy achieved so far.
*   **Experiment 2:**
    *   **Strategy:** Multi-stage reasoning with explicit instructions for entity extraction, knowledge lookup, synthesis, and validation.
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The experiment rejected the hypothesis that a multi-stage reasoning approach with LLMs, even with explicit instructions for each stage (entity extraction, knowledge lookup, synthesis, validation), is sufficient to answer complex factual questions without more robust knowledge retrieval mechanisms. The decomposition into stages did not compensate for the base-level problem of incorrect information retrieval. The experiment also confirmed the reliance of LLMs on external knowledge sources when answering factual questions. Inaccurate information from these sources directly leads to incorrect answers, regardless of the sophistication of the reasoning process.
*   **Experiment 3:**
    *   **Strategy:** RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) framework with Gemini model. Multiple agents for query generation, information extraction, and verification with explicit source citation.
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis that a basic RAG framework with Gemini is sufficient for this task is rejected. The current implementation struggles to extract answers, even with explicit source citation and verification steps. The decomposition into multiple agents (query generation, extraction, verification) doesn't appear to be effective with the current implementation. Information extraction, specifically, is a critical failure point. The generic LLM is insufficient to reliably perform this task, or at least the current prompting strategy is insufficient.
*   **Experiment 4:**
    *   **Strategy:** Fact verification with multi-source integration. Decomposed the problem into generating multiple search queries, simulating context retrieval, extracting answers, synthesizing a final answer, and validating that final answer.
    *   **Result:** 0.33 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The simulation of context retrieval proves insufficient. The "simulated search results" are not detailed enough to answer the questions. The attempt to solve the problem using fact verification *without* equipping the system with active information seeking proves ineffective. The accuracy of 0.33 confirms the hypothesis that the system cannot passively rely on initial context. This approach needs an active information-seeking loop.
*   **Experiment 5:**
    *   **Strategy:** Iterative refinement and extraction, leveraging LLMs for query formulation, information retrieval, and answer extraction, followed by stringent validation.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis that the LLM-driven iterative refinement and extraction approach would be effective for this factual question answering task is rejected. The current implementation struggles with reliable retrieval and validation. The experiment highlights the validation step as a major bottleneck. Even if the system retrieves potentially correct information, the strict validation logic prevents it from being recognized as such.
*   **Script Repair Errors:**
    *   **Error 1:** `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'extracted_answer' where it is not associated with a value`. Occurred during script repair attempt 1. Indicates a logic error where `extracted_answer` was used before being assigned a value.
    *   **Error 2 & 3:** "ERROR: Validation failure" during script repair attempts 2 & 3. This reinforces the issues with the overly strict validation process.
    *   **Error 4:** "list index out of range" occurred during script repair attempt 2, indicating an issue with accessing elements in a list beyond its bounds. Specifically, the error occurred while trying to access `retrieved_contexts[1]`, suggesting that only one context was retrieved.
    *   **Error 5:** "Gemini API call failed due to missing attribute" occurred during script repair attempt 3, indicating a problem with the API call, potentially due to missing parameters or an incorrect API configuration.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Implement an Active Information Seeking Loop:** Augment the system with a mechanism to:
    1.  **Detect** when it lacks sufficient information to answer a question with confidence.
    2.  **Generate** new, targeted search queries designed to fill specific information gaps. For example, if the initial query "Etta Cone Europe visits" doesn't return a year, the system should generate a follow-up query like "Etta Cone last visit to Europe year".
    3.  **Incorporate** the information retrieved from these new queries into its knowledge base.
*   **Relax Validation Criteria:** Implement more flexible validation. Consider:
    *   Semantic similarity checks instead of exact string matching.
    *   Allowing for answers that contain more information than the minimal expected answer, as long as the core information is present and correct.
    *   Introducing a confidence score threshold for validation, where answers with high confidence, even if not perfectly matching the expected answer, are accepted.
    *   **Fuzzy Matching:** Using techniques like Levenshtein distance or semantic similarity to compare the system's answer with the expected answer, allowing for minor variations in wording or spelling.
    *   **Type Checking:** Implementing logic to specifically compare numerical answers without requiring an exact string match.
*   **Improve Relevance Validation:** The "relevance" checks on retrieved information need to be more stringent. The system should not proceed with information extraction if the retrieved context is only tangentially related to the question.
*   **Refine Query Generation:** The initial query generation step needs improvement to create more specific and focused queries. Explore techniques to expand the initial search query to include synonyms or related terms, increasing the chances of finding relevant information.
*   **Focus on Temporal Reasoning:** Since many questions require specific years, develop specialized modules/prompts that focus on extracting and reasoning about temporal information. For questions asking for years, ensure that the validator correctly assesses the validity of the extracted year against the expected year.
*   **Improve Answer Extraction Prompting:** Focus on refining the prompt used by the answer extraction agent. Experiment with more specific instructions, few-shot examples demonstrating the desired extraction format, and constraints on the output format (e.g., "Only provide the name of the person/university/genus").
*   **Incorporate Relationship Extraction Techniques:** Explore incorporating relationship extraction techniques into the answer extraction agent. This could involve using the LLM to explicitly identify relationships between entities in the context and then using this information to extract the answer. For example, prompt the LLM to identify the 'awardee' relationship for the 'Paul Karrer Gold Medal' in '2004'.
*   **Fine-tune extraction**: Consider fine-tuning a smaller, more efficient LLM specifically for the information extraction task. This could improve the accuracy and speed of the system.
*   **Test Context Quality**: While the focus is on extraction, verify that the retrieved context contains the necessary information *before* optimizing the extraction prompt. There's an implicit assumption the context is adequate, but this should be explicitly validated.
*   **Analyze Failure Cases in Detail**: Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the failure cases. For each failure, examine the question, the retrieved context, the LLM's response, and the ground truth answer to identify the root cause of the failure. This will help to identify specific areas where the system needs improvement.
*   **Improve Entity Linking/Resolution:** Implement more robust entity linking strategies, such as using a named entity disambiguation module before querying the LLM. This could involve cross-referencing extracted entities against a known database or knowledge graph to ensure accurate identification.
*   **Refine Knowledge Graph Retrieval:** Investigate the knowledge graph lookup process. This could involve:
    *   Evaluating the quality and coverage of the underlying knowledge graph.
    *   Optimizing the query formulation to the knowledge graph based on extracted entities and relationships. Ensure the queries are precise and target the specific information needed.
*   **Knowledge Source Augmentation:** Consider augmenting the knowledge source with additional data to address gaps in coverage, specifically for less commonly known facts.
*   **Implement a Fact Verification Module:** Before answer synthesis, add a step to verify the extracted information against multiple sources (if available) to reduce the impact of incorrect information from a single source.
*   **Improve Contextual Understanding in Validation:** Enhance the validation prompt to explicitly consider the context provided in the original question. For example, provide the validator with the original question and ask it to confirm that the extracted answer directly addresses all parts of the question (team, event, date, etc.).
*   **Evaluate Information Retrieval Simulation:** Examine the quality of the simulated information retrieval. Is the search query being generated effectively capturing the essence of the question? Does the "retrieved" information contain the answer (even if the extraction fails)? Consider adding a step to evaluate the quality of the retrieved information independently of the answer extraction.
*   **Implement Explicit Error Handling/Reporting:** Instead of simply outputting "Could not be validated," provide more detailed feedback on *why* the validation failed. This will help diagnose issues with the validation process itself and prevent similar errors (like the `UnboundLocalError`) in the future.
*   **Prompt Engineering for Answer Extraction:** Refine the prompt used for answer extraction. Ensure it clearly instructs the LLM to extract the *specific* information requested and to provide a confidence score.
*   **Address the `UnboundLocalError`:** Implement a default value for `extracted_answer` or refactor the code to guarantee it is always assigned before being used. Add logging to track the flow of execution and variable assignments.
*   **Focus on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Prioritize techniques that combine information retrieval with LLM generation to leverage external knowledge and reduce hallucination. Start with basic RAG and iteratively refine the retrieval and generation prompts.
*   **Improve Search Query Generation:** Refine the `generate_search_query` function to produce more targeted queries that specifically address the key entities and relationships in the question. For the "Monsieur Mallah" example, ensure the query explicitly targets the murderer.
*   **Enhance Answer Extraction with Contextual Reasoning:** Enhance the `extract_answer` function to consider the context within the simulated search results. Implement strategies to weigh different sources of information based on reliability or relevance, and to resolve conflicts between sources.
*   **Strengthen Validation Logic:** The `validate_answer` function needs more sophisticated logic to identify semantic equivalence. For example, it should be able to recognize that "Gorilla Grodd" is the murderer of Monsieur Mallah even if the search results don't explicitly state "Gorilla Grodd murdered Monsieur Mallah" but contain information strongly implying it.
*   **Data Augmentation with Known Facts:** Augment the simulated search results with known facts, or use an LLM specifically trained for QA to extract more accurate information. This is to overcome the issue of poor simulated search results.
*   **Implement Explicit Reasoning Steps:** Force the LLM to verbalize its reasoning steps (e.g., "I found X in source Y. Source Z contradicts this, but source Y is more reliable. Therefore, the answer is X."). This makes debugging and error analysis easier. This could be done in the prompt, or by adding another LLM step for this explicit reasoning.
*   **Improve validation stage:** The "Could not be validated" error suggests a problem with determining the correctness of the final answer. Improve this stage by explicitly prompting for the reasoning behind the answer.
*   **Implement RAG with specific knowledge base:** Instead of letting the LLM find the information, use Retrieval Augmented Generation to provide the context to the LLM. This involves creating or selecting a relevant knowledge base and designing a retrieval mechanism to fetch the most relevant passages based on the question.
*   **Need for enhanced fine-tuning**: The generic LLM is insufficient to reliably perform this task, or at least the current prompting strategy is insufficient.
*   **Address List Index Out of Range Errors**: Add error handling to prevent "list index out of range" errors. Specifically, ensure that the code checks if the list has at least two elements before accessing `retrieved_contexts[1]`. Also log the number of returned contexts and the question asked when such an error occurs.
*   **Fix Gemini API Call Issues**: Review the Gemini API call implementation and ensure that all required parameters are present and correctly configured. Implement error handling to catch API call failures and provide informative error messages. Log the specific parameters sent to the API before the call.
*   **Error Analysis:** Implement more detailed logging to capture the exact information retrieved by the system and the reason for validation failure. This will allow for a more fine-grained analysis of the error patterns.
*   **Specific example handling:** For questions asking for years, ensure that the validator correctly assesses the validity of the extracted year against the expected year.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #1:
Iteration: 1
Accuracy: 0.33
Approach Summary: The script uses LLM-based techniques with agent roles for information extraction, search query generation, answer extraction, and answer validation to answer questions. It decomposes the problem into extracting information, generating a search query, simulating search results using the LLM, extracting the answer, and validating the answer. The functions used are `call_llm`, `extract_information`, `generate_search_query`, `extract_answer`, `validate_answer`, and `main`. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling the functions sequentially, starting with information extraction and ending with answer validation, using the output of one function as input to the next.

TOP PERFORMING APPROACH #2:
Iteration: 4
Accuracy: 0.33
Approach Summary: The script uses a fact verification approach with multi-source integration, leveraging the Gemini LLM to answer factual questions. It decomposes the problem into generating multiple search queries, simulating context retrieval from these queries while verifying their relevance, extracting answers from each context, synthesizing a final answer, and validating that final answer. The agent roles include an expert at generating diverse search queries, an agent for validating retrieved context, an expert at extracting and synthesizing answers, and an expert answer validator. The functions used are `call_llm` which interacts with the Gemini LLM, and `main` which orchestrates the overall workflow involving prompt generation, LLM calls, and result validation.

            PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED VARIATIONS:
            

            EXPLOITATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the error patterns, targeted improvements, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. CRITICAL: Break down the problem into distinct reasoning steps before modifying code
            3. CRITICAL: Analyze the best scripts to identify which components are working well and which are failing. Focus your improvements on the weak points while preserving successful components.
            4. Maintain the core successful elements of the best approaches
            5. Consider how you can combine strengths from multiple top-performing approaches
            6. CRITICAL: Add EMBEDDED EXAMPLES to EVERY LLM prompt that illustrate:
               - Sample input that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            7. Focus on fixing specific issues identified in previous error analyses. Create an explicit HYPOTHESIS for each targeted improvement, as well as a way to verify if it's successful.
            8. Enhance chain-of-thought reasoning and verification steps. Verification steps should be added to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            9. Apply the key insights from ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS to enhance the approach
            10. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment

            IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
            Analyze why the top approaches succeeded where others failed. Identify the key differentiators and strengthen them further.

            SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT APPROACH:
            1. First, identify which specific function or component is underperforming based on error analysis
            2. Examine how error cases differ from successful cases
            3. For each identified weakness, implement a targeted enhancement
            4. Add additional verification steps around modified components
            5. Consider how components interact - ensure improvements don't break successful parts

            Consider enhancing the script with one or more of these patterns:
            - Repeated validation with feedback loops
            - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
            - Dynamic input-dependent routing
            - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
            - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
            - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
            - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for refinement with feedback

            Since this is an EXPLOITATION phase:
            - Build upon what's working well in the best approaches
            - Consider creative combinations of successful techniques from different scripts
            - Make TARGETED improvements to address specific error patterns
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply the knowledge from our accumulated learnings
            - Significantly enhance the script to address weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your improvements
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

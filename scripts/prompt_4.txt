            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
            

            Here are example problems from previously seen data:
            [
  {
    "id": 0,
    "question": "One morning each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk. The amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. How many people are in the family?",
    "answer": "Suppose that the whole family drank $x$ cups of milk and $y$ cups of coffee. Let $n$ denote the number of people in the family. The information given implies that $\\frac{x}{4}+\\frac{y}{6}=\\frac{x+y}{n}$. This leads to \\[\n3x(n-4)=2y(6-n).\n\\]Since $x$ and $y$ are positive, the only positive integer $n$ for which both sides have the same sign is $n=\\boxed{5}$."
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "How many integer divisors does $7$ have?",
    "answer": "The factors of $7$ are $-7, -1, 1,$ and $7$, for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ factors."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "question": "Given that a particular positive integer is a four-digit palindrome, what is the probability that it is a multiple of $99?$ Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "answer": "First we find the number of $4$ digit palindromes. There are ten palindromes for every distinct thousandth digit from $1$ to $9$ because there are $10$ numbers from $0$ to $9$ we could pick for the second and third digit. This gives us a total of $9 \\cdot 10$ palindromes.\n\nNext, we can get that all palindromes are multiples of $11$. The divisibility rule for $11$ tells us that for a number $abcd$ to be divisible by $11$, then $a-b+c-d$ is divisible by $11$. Since $a=d$ and $b=c$, $a-b+c-d$ is always divisible by $11$ so all four digit palindromes are divisible by $11$.\n\nNow we want to find now many of these palindromes are divisible by $9$. For a number to be divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9.$ It's impossible for the sum of the digits to be equal to $9$ or $27$ because it must be an even number (the sum is $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)$). We find the number of palindromes whose digits add up to $18.$ Since $a+b+c+d=2(a+b)=18,$ we get that $a+b=9.$ There are $9$ possible answers, where $a$ goes from $1$ to $9$ and $b=9-a$. We then find the number of palindromes whose digit add up to $36.$ There is only one four-digit number that does so, $9999.$\n\nTherefore, we have that there are $9+1=10$ four-digit palindromes that are divisible by $99.$\n\nSince there is a total of $90$ palindromes, the probability that it is divisible by $99$ is $\\frac{10}{90}=\\boxed{\\frac19}$."

No agent roles are explicitly defined. The `call_llm` function is used to send prompts to the LLM and return the response, `main` takes the question and orchestrates the calls to `call_llm` to get the sub-questions, answers to sub-questions, and a final synthesis.

The `call_llm` function is used as a wrapper to call the Gemini API with different prompts and system instructions, defining roles like \"expert at decomposing complex math problems\" for each step. The overall workflow involves decomposing the initial question, solving the sub-problems, synthesizing the solutions, verifying that the response is coherent and then returning the final answer or an error message if the coherency check fails."

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Add more Print Statements for Future Debugging:** Add more print statements to show the intermediate stages of calculations so that in the future you can tell where things went wrong.",
  "Enhanced Constraint Handling:** Add explicit checks and validation steps to ensure all problem constraints are considered throughout the solution process. This could involve using automated constraint satisfaction techniques or incorporating constraint programming elements.",
  "Implement a Numerical Verification Module:** Integrate a numerical verification module to double-check the correctness of arithmetic computations. This could involve unit testing or using an external calculator to confirm results. For median calculation, explicitly check all values and their positions in sorted order.",
  "Return a default response indicating that the system was unable to solve the problem.",
  "Generate an error message that is more informative than the current \"Error calling LLM\" message.",
  "Retry the LLM call with slightly different parameters (e.g., a shorter question, a different prompt)."

    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).

    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.

        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:

            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 3 (explore, ACCURACY: 1.00) ===
Approach: The script employs a "Decompose-Solve-Verify" approach using the Gemini LLM, enhanced by multi-example prompting to improve accuracy. The problem is broken down into smaller steps by `decompose_problem`, then `solve_sub_problems` solves these steps, and `synthesize_solutions` combines the solutions into a final answer which is then verified for coherency using `check_coherency`. The `call_llm` function is used as a wrapper to call the Gemini API with different prompts and system instructions, defining roles like "expert at decomposing complex math problems" for each step. The overall workflow involves decomposing the initial question, solving the sub-problems, synthesizing the solutions, verifying that the response is coherent and then returning the final answer or an error message if the coherency check fails.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 2 (explore, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script employs a two-agent approach using the Gemini LLM to solve math problems: a "Problem Analyzer" that formats the question into a structured JSON and a "Solution Generator" that produces a step-by-step solution based on the analysis. A third "Solution Validator" agent is also used to validate the generated solution against the original question. The problem is decomposed into analysis, solution generation, and validation steps. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling `analyze_problem` to analyze the input question, then `generate_solution` to create the solution, and finally `validate_solution` to check the solution, and the `call_llm` function is used to call the LLM with different system instructions and prompts for each agent.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 1 (refine, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script implements a chain-of-thought approach to answer a question by breaking it down into sub-questions, answering each sub-question independently, and then synthesizing the individual answers into a final response. The `main` function orchestrates this process, using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model for question breakdown, answering sub-questions, and synthesizing the final answer. No agent roles are explicitly defined. The `call_llm` function is used to send prompts to the LLM and return the response, `main` takes the question and orchestrates the calls to `call_llm` to get the sub-questions, answers to sub-questions, and a final synthesis. The overall workflow involves question decomposition, answering sub-questions, and synthesizing the final answer.

# Math Question Dataset: Evolving Research Log

This document serves as a dynamic research log, capturing our evolving understanding, strategies, and findings related to the task of solving math questions from the provided dataset. It prioritizes concrete, task-specific insights.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Mathematical Content Variety:** The dataset contains a diverse set of math problems, encompassing arithmetic, number theory, and probability, in addition to algebra, geometry, and more complex topics. This requires the system to handle a broad range of mathematical concepts and problem-solving strategies. Examples include divisibility rules, prime factorization, area calculations, and probability calculations.
*   **Question Content:** Predominantly multi-step mathematical reasoning problems. Requires a combination of algebra, geometry, and number theory. Questions range in complexity, requiring both computational and conceptual understanding.
*   **Mathematical Formulation:** Questions are primarily mathematical problems, often requiring symbolic manipulation (using LaTeX notation), number theory concepts, or geometric reasoning.
*   **Multi-Step Solutions:** The "expected" answers often involve multiple steps of logical deduction or calculation. This reinforces the necessity of decomposing problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
*   **Word Problem Complexity:** Questions are presented as word problems, often involving fictional scenarios or abstract concepts (e.g., "Penteria"). This necessitates strong natural language understanding to correctly translate the problem into mathematical terms.
*   **Answer Style:** Concise, step-by-step solutions using LaTeX. Final answers often boxed.
*   **Formatting:** Uses LaTeX for mathematical expressions and Asymptote code for diagrams. Accurate LaTeX interpretation is crucial.
*   **Numerical Focus:** Many questions require finding specific numerical values (e.g., smallest possible value, probability, arithmetic mean), demanding precise calculations.
*   **Reasoning Types:** Deductive, algebraic manipulation, spatial, computational, and logical.
*   **Hidden Constraints and Assumptions:** Problems often rely on implicit constraints or assumptions that are not explicitly stated, making accurate interpretation challenging. For example, the "Penteria" problem implicitly assumes the initial population is a positive integer.
*   **Dataset Size and Diversity:** While initial experiments focused on smaller samples, the dataset contains sufficient variety in topics (number theory, algebra, probability, etc.) and difficulty to necessitate testing robustness and generalizability. This includes abstract concepts and creative problem-solving skills.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Geometry problems involving area/circumference calculations, vector geometry.
    *   Number theory problems involving divisibility, digit sums, and prime factorization.
    *   Algebra problems involving solving equations.
    *   Probability Problems involving calculations based on provided sets.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Ineffective (Baseline):** Direct LLM call. Accuracy ~50%. Insufficient for the complexity and precision required.
*   **(Untested) Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** Breaking down questions into smaller, manageable sub-problems appears promising due to the multi-step nature of the solutions. However, this strategy remained untested initially due to data processing errors preventing successful LLM calls. Now integrated into the more successful "Decompose-Solve-Verify" approach.
*   **Modular Analysis:** The "Problem Analyzer" agent's structured JSON output (problem type, topic, knowns, unknowns, steps) appears beneficial in breaking down complex problems into manageable components. This structured representation can be leveraged for more robust reasoning. Incorporated into "Decompose-Solve-Verify".
*   **Prime Factorization Considerations:** Prime factorization of relevant values (e.g., set members in probability problems) can be crucial for identifying solutions.
*   **Decompose-Solve-Verify:** This approach breaks down complex problems into manageable sub-problems. This has proven effective in recent experiments, contributing to a 100% accuracy rate in one iteration.
*   **Multi-Example Prompting:** Guiding the LLM with multiple examples improves accuracy by providing relevant context.
*   **Specialized System Instructions:** Using specialized system instructions for each step of the process (e.g., "expert at decomposing complex math problems") enhances the quality of the LLM's output. This applies specifically to the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" approach.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Arithmetic and Logical Calculation Errors:** Consistent errors in basic arithmetic and logical calculations (e.g., median, probability). *Example: Incorrectly calculating the median in the stem and leaf plot question.*
*   **Misinterpretation of Problem Context:** Failing to fully understand the constraints or conditions stated in the problem, leading to incorrect solution paths. *Example: LLM jumps directly to a numerical answer without proper justification in divisibility question.* In the "Penteria" problem, the LLM does not properly handle the hourly reset condition.
*   **LaTeX Interpretation Issues:** Subtle errors in interpreting LaTeX can lead to misconstrued equations and wrong answers.
*   **Difficulty:** Understanding the problem statement, which may involve complex mathematical notation. Choosing the right approach and applying the correct formulas. Performing accurate calculations. Dealing with multi-step problems requiring a sequence of logical deductions. Interpreting visual information from diagrams (when present).
*   **Edge Cases/Complexities:** Problems with subtle wording that can lead to misinterpretation. Questions requiring creative problem-solving or non-obvious insights. Diagrams that may be misleading or require careful analysis. Calculations involving fractions, radicals, or other potentially error-prone operations.
*   **`NoneType` Error in LLM Call:** The LLM call consistently failed due to receiving a `NoneType` argument. This suggests a problem with the script's data processing flow *before* the `call_llm` function. A variable expected to hold a string or iterable (likely the prompt or a list of sub-questions) is unexpectedly becoming `None`.
    *   **Script Error Log [2025-05-28 01:51:54]:** ERROR: TypeError: 'NoneType' is not iterable
    *   **Script Error Log [2025-05-28 01:51:59]:** ERROR: NoneType not iterable
    *   **Script Error Log [2025-05-28 01:52:04]:** ERROR: TypeError: 'NoneType' is not iterable
*   **Inconsistent Application of Constraints:** The primary failure mode is the model's inability to consistently apply constraints within the problem statement. This leads to misinterpretations and incorrect solutions. For example, in the "Penteria" problem, the LLM does not properly handle the hourly reset condition.
*   **Misinterpreting Problem Logic:** Even with a structured analysis, the "Solution Generator" struggles to translate the analysis into correct mathematical operations. In the "Penteria" problem, the agent misinterprets the problem's reset condition and makes incorrect calculations.
*   **Inability to handle implicit constraints:** The set member values of {2, 4, 12, 14, 21, 28, 98} are all positive integers. The solution does not seem to check that the initial population of the Penteria problem should also be a positive integer. This highlights the need for explicit constraint handling.
*   **Ambiguity and Complexity:** Even with successful strategies like "Decompose-Solve-Verify," more challenging or ambiguous questions could reveal new failure modes, emphasizing the need for continuous testing and refinement.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Experiment 0 (Baseline):**
    *   **Description:** Direct call to the LLM with the question.
    *   **Accuracy:** ~50%
    *   **Findings:** The baseline approach is inadequate. Requires more than just general knowledge; necessitates precise calculation and logical reasoning capabilities. Calculation errors and misinterpretations of context are frequent.
*   **Experiment 1:**
    *   **Description:** Attempt to implement a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach by breaking down the question into sub-questions.
    *   **Accuracy:** 0% (LLM call failed consistently)
    *   **Findings:** The core CoT strategy remains untested *in isolation*. The LLM call consistently fails due to a `NoneType` error originating *before* the `call_llm` function. Further debugging is needed to identify the source of the `None` value. Error handling only catches exceptions *during* the LLM call, not problems in data preparation *before* the call. The `NoneType` error halted script execution, preventing any assessment of the CoT's effectiveness on this dataset. Highlighted the importance of robust input validation. The underlying principle of CoT, however, contributed to the later "Decompose-Solve-Verify" success.
*   **Experiment 2:**
    *   **Description:** Implemented a modular approach with "Problem Analyzer," "Solution Generator," and "Solution Validator" agents. The "Problem Analyzer" generated structured JSON output.
    *   **Accuracy:** 0.33
    *   **Findings:** The initial hypothesis that decomposing the problem into analysis, solution generation, and validation steps helps in math problem-solving is partially supported, as indicated by the structured JSON output. However, the low accuracy indicates that the current implementation of this approach is not robust enough. Highlights the limitations of the Gemini LLM in complex mathematical reasoning, especially when dealing with implicit constraints and nuanced problem logic. Ultimately led to the development of the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" strategy.
*   **Experiment 3:**
    *   **Description:** Implemented the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" approach with multi-example prompting and specialized system instructions.
    *   **Accuracy:** 1.00
    *   **Findings:** This experiment confirms that the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" approach, combined with multi-example prompting and specialized system instructions, can effectively solve math word problems in this dataset, at least on the tested sample. However, further testing on a larger and more diverse dataset is needed to ensure robustness and generalizability. A perfect accuracy suggests that the LLM can handle the complexity and variety of questions *within the tested sample*.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Debugging Data Flow:** *HIGH PRIORITY*. Revisit and thoroughly debug the data flow to prevent `NoneType` errors. Add print statements or logging to track the values of variables at each step of the data processing pipeline, especially before calling `call_llm`. Specifically, examine the data preparation steps within the `main` function and related functions.
*   **Input Validation:** Add checks *before* calling `call_llm` to ensure that the prompt (or any other input it receives) is not `None`. If it is, log an error message and potentially try to recover (e.g., by substituting a default prompt or skipping the question). Implement a clear error handling strategy for these cases.
*   **Re-evaluate CoT (Indirectly Addressed):** While pure CoT failed initially, the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" approach incorporates the core principle. No need for separate evaluation.
*   **Implement Calculator Tool:** Offload arithmetic calculations to a tool for accurate numerical computation.
*   **Step-by-Step Reasoning:** Continue incorporating a step-by-step reasoning approach in the prompt to decompose problems into verifiable steps. This is inherent in "Decompose-Solve-Verify".
*   **Verifier Implementation:** Continue to use a verifier to check the LLM's final answer against the problem's constraints and logical consistency. This is already part of the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" framework.
*   **LaTeX Handling Improvement:** Improve LaTeX handling either via pre-processing or prompt engineering.
*   **Constraint Enforcement Module:** Implement a module specifically designed to identify and enforce constraints within the problem statement. This could involve explicitly listing constraints in the JSON output of the "Problem Analyzer" and using them to guide the "Solution Generator." Explicitly add constraints to the problem that the initial population must be a positive integer (e.g., in "Penteria"-like problems).
*   **Verification Step:** Create a calculation checker to make sure the math is calculated correctly.
*   **Targeted Prompt Engineering:** Refine the prompts for the "Solution Generator" to emphasize constraint adherence and logical reasoning.
*   **Self-Consistency Checks:** Incorporate self-consistency checks within the "Solution Validator" to identify contradictions or inconsistencies in the generated solution.
*   **Broader Dataset Testing:** Expand testing to a larger and more diverse set of problems to assess the generalizability and robustness of the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" strategy.
*   **Ambiguity Stress Testing:** Introduce more challenging and ambiguous questions to specifically identify potential failure points and limitations of the current approach.
*   **Efficiency Optimization:** Explore ways to optimize the prompts and system instructions to improve the efficiency and scalability of the "Decompose-Solve-Verify" approach.
*   **Solution Strategies:** (Reminder of potential techniques)
    *   **Direct Calculation:** Solve the problem by applying relevant formulas and performing calculations directly.
    *   **Equation Solving:** Set up equations based on the problem statement and solve for the unknown variables.
    *   **Geometric Reasoning:** Use geometric properties and relationships to find the solution.
    *   **Casework:** Divide the problem into different cases and solve each case separately.
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Identify patterns or relationships that can help solve the problem.
*   **Problem Decomposition:** (Reminder of decomposition steps)
    1.  **Understand the Problem:** Carefully read the question and identify the knowns and unknowns. Translate the problem into mathematical notation.
    2.  **Develop a Plan:** Determine which formulas, theorems, or techniques are relevant to the problem.
    3.  **Execute the Plan:** Apply the chosen techniques to solve the problem.
    4.  **Check the Answer:** Verify that the answer is reasonable and consistent with the problem statement.
*   **Validation Techniques:** (Reminder of validation techniques)
    *   **Unit Analysis:** Check that the units of the answer are correct.
    *   **Estimation:** Estimate the answer to see if it's in the right ballpark.
    *   **Substitution:** Plug the answer back into the original problem to see if it works.
    *   **Dimensional Analysis:** Check that the dimensions of the quantities are consistent.
    *   **Consider extreme values:** check the answer works for extreme values of some variable.
*   **Creative Insights:** (Reminder of creative insight techniques)
    *   Sometimes, a geometric problem can be solved more easily using algebra, or vice versa.
    *   Looking for symmetries in the problem can simplify the solution.
    *   Rearranging the problem statement or using a different coordinate system can sometimes reveal a simpler solution path. Think about the problem from a different angle. Can you reframe the question or use a different representation? Instead of trying to solve the problem directly, try to solve a simpler version of the problem first. Draw analogies to other problem domains where similar concepts or techniques apply.
*   **Implementation Recommendations:** (Reminder of implementation aspects)
    *   **Verification Steps:** Mathematical Correctness: The most crucial aspect. Verify that each step in the solution is mathematically sound. Consistency with Problem Statement: Ensure that the solution addresses the specific question asked and uses the given information correctly. Reasonableness of Answer: Check if the answer is reasonable in the context of the problem (e.g., a negative length is likely wrong). Edge Case Testing: Test the solution with edge cases or extreme values to ensure it holds true in all scenarios.
    *   **Intermediate Steps/Representations:** Symbolic Representation: Maintain the problem in symbolic form (using variables and equations) as long as possible to avoid premature numerical evaluation. Equation Tree: Represent the equations as a tree structure to facilitate manipulation and simplification. Diagrammatic Representation: (If applicable) Use a graph or diagram to represent the geometric relationships in the problem.
    *   **Text-Based Techniques:** LaTeX Parsing & Generation: While avoiding complex code generation, leverage LLMs' ability to understand and generate LaTeX. This is crucial for both interpreting questions and formatting answers. Step-by-Step Reasoning Chain: Prompt the LLM to explicitly state its reasoning in a step-by-step manner. This allows for easier debugging and verification. Each step should be a complete sentence. Formula Identification: Train the LLM to identify relevant formulas based on keywords in the problem statement. Equation Simplification: Use prompting to guide the LLM to simplify equations and expressions. Example-Based Learning: Fine-tune the LLM on a large dataset of similar problems and solutions. Verification Prompting: Use separate prompts to verify the correctness of each step in the solution and the final answer. For example, "Is this step logically valid based on the previous step?" "Does this answer make sense in the context of the problem?" Avoid Over-Reliance on Code: Don't try to offload the *reasoning* to external code. Use code only for arithmetic or symbolic manipulation if absolutely necessary, and always verify the results.

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

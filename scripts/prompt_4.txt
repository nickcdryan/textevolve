    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓
    2. Delete operation: The solution uses the hashmap to find the index, then swaps with the last element and updates accordingly with O(1) time complexity ✓
    3. Get random operation: The solution generates a random index within the array bounds with O(1) time complexity ✓
    4. All operations have O(1) average time complexity ✓
    
    Result: VALID - The solution correctly addresses all requirements with the specified time complexity.

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error in extraction/validation (attempt {attempt+1}/{max_attempts}): {str(e)}")
                    if attempt >= max_attempts - 1:
                        return {
                            "is_valid": False,
                            "validation_feedback": f"Error during processing: {str(e)}"
                        }

            return {
                "is_valid": False,
                "validation_feedback": "Failed to extract valid entities after multiple attempts."
            }
        ```

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

        

            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, I've updated the research log with the new learnings from Iteration 3, focusing on concrete, task-specific insights for the Grid Transformation Task dataset.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   **Question Format:** Tasks are presented as "Grid Transformation Tasks." Each task includes "TRAINING EXAMPLES" (input/output grid pairs) and a "TEST INPUT" grid. The objective is to generate the "OUTPUT GRID" for the test input, following patterns from the training examples.
*   **Grid Representation:** Grids are represented as nested lists of integers (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`). Grid dimensions (rows and columns) vary between examples and even within a single example (input vs. output).
*   **Grid Structure and Values:** The dataset consists of grid transformation problems. The input and output grids are represented as nested lists of integers. The integers themselves represent cell states or values, often with '0' representing an empty or inactive state.
*   **Transformation Logic:** The core challenge is identifying the transformation logic. This logic can involve:
    *   Spatial relationships between numbers (e.g., a cell's value depends on its neighbors). The rules are often *localized* to the vicinity of a cell.
    *   Numerical transformations (e.g., adding a constant to each cell).
    *   Combinations of spatial and numerical transformations. The transformations can be complex and context-dependent, applying differently based on the location or the neighboring elements of an element.
    *   Transformations can involve replacing elements with new values based on their original value and location, and introducing new non-zero values to previously zeroed cells.
*   **Implicit Rules:** Transformation logic is *never* explicitly stated. The LLM must infer the rules from limited training examples.
*   **Consistent Structure:** All questions are fundamentally the same type: grid transformation. This allows us to focus on refining techniques applicable to this specific problem structure.
*   **Example Patterns**: Replication of rows/columns, shifting values, replacing values based on surrounding cells.
*   **Few-Shot Learning Format:** Questions are presented in a few-shot format, including multiple training examples (input/output grid pairs) followed by a test input grid. The task is to infer the transformation rule from the training examples and apply it to the test input. The success of this approach depends heavily on the quality and consistency of the training examples provided, including their ability to represent the transformation's logic within only a few samples.
*   **Abstract Rules:** The underlying transformation rules are abstract and not immediately obvious. They can involve changes to specific numbers, their locations relative to other numbers, or based on other complex patterns in the grid. The challenges lie in deciphering abstract patterns and generalizing rules beyond the provided examples.
*   **Grid-Based Input/Output:** The dataset consists of grid transformation problems, where the input and output are represented as 2D arrays (grids) of integers. The task involves identifying and applying a transformation rule to the input grid to produce the output grid. The grids have consistent dimensions within each example, but sizes can vary across examples.
*   **Training Examples followed by Test Input:** Each problem is structured with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" showing input-output pairs, followed by a "TEST INPUT" for which the transformed grid must be generated.
*   **Mixed Element Types:** Grids often contain a mix of elements, including zeros and other numerical values.

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   **None Currently:** At this stage (Accuracy 0.00 in Iteration 0, Iteration 1, Iteration 2, and Iteration 3), no strategies can be definitively said to be working effectively. This indicates a fundamental failure to grasp and apply the grid transformation patterns. We are in the initial stages of exploration.

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **Incorrect Pattern Generalization:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation patterns from the training examples. This leads to the application of incorrect rules to the test input. For example, it might misinterpret a spatial relationship or a value-based trigger for a transformation. *Example: All Iteration 0, Iteration 1, Iteration 2, and Iteration 3 errors.*
*   **Pattern Generalization Failure:** The LLM fails to generalize the transformation logic from training examples to the test input. The generated output grids do not match the expected output grids. *Example: All Iteration 0, Iteration 1, Iteration 2, and Iteration 3 errors.* The LLM demonstrates *poor generalization* from the training examples, failing to extrapolate transformation rules when the test input differs even slightly from the training set.
*   **Dimensionality Mismatch:** The LLM generates output grids with incorrect dimensions compared to the expected output grid. This suggests a failure to understand how input grid dimensions influence output grid dimensions. *Example: Iteration 0, Example 2.*
*   **Shape and Dimensionality Errors:** The generated output grids often have incorrect shapes or dimensions compared to the expected output. This indicates a failure in understanding how the transformations affect the overall grid structure, or simply a failure in array construction in the generation stage.
*   **Incorrect Value Mapping:** Even when the dimensions are correct, the LLM fails to map values correctly. The numerical relationships between corresponding cells in the input and output grids are not accurately learned and applied. *Example: Iteration 0, Example 3.*
*   **Value Errors:** The system generates grids containing numbers not present in the target grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** The LLM outputs the response as a string containing Python code that *would* define the output grid, rather than directly outputting the grid. This indicates a potential confusion between generating code and generating the desired output directly. *Example: Iteration 0, Examples 2 and 3.*
*   **Ambiguity:** The transformations are implicit and can be interpreted in multiple ways from just a few examples.
*   **Complexity:** The underlying transformations might be complex involving combinations of replication, shifting, value changes, and so on.
*   **Varying Grid Sizes:** Transformations might be size-dependent.
*   **Multiple Possible Rules:** Different transformations might yield similar results on the training data but diverge on the test data.
*   **Value Dependencies:** A cell's new value may depend on multiple other cells.
*   **Asymmetric Transformations:** The transformation might not be symmetrical across the grid.
*   **Inability to Extract Accurate Transformation Rules:** The system consistently fails to extract accurate and generalizable transformation rules from the training examples. The LLM struggles to understand the underlying logic and often generates rules that are either too specific to the training examples or simply incorrect.
    *   *Example:* "The transformation rule is as follows: All numbers except '5' are replaced based on their position in the grid. The grid is divided into three horizontal sections separated by the rows of '5's. In the top section, all numbers except '5' are replaced with '2'. In the middle section, all numbers except '5' are replaced with '4'. In the bottom section, all numbers except '5' are replaced with '6'. The number '5' remains unchanged." This shows an attempt at pattern recognition, but the rule oversimplifies the transformation and doesn't account for variations within the sections.
*   **Fragility of Pattern Recognition:** The system's pattern recognition approach is fragile and easily disrupted by small variations in the input grids. It relies on specific conditional logic that does not generalize well to unseen data.
*   **Lack of Rule Validation:** The system's rule validation process is not robust enough to catch inaccurate or incomplete rules. Even with validation, the system often proceeds with flawed rules, leading to incorrect outputs. In many failure cases, the validation process itself fails, with rules being accepted and applied despite being inaccurate.
*   **Localized Contextual Analysis Insufficient:** The LLM struggles to generalize even seemingly simple local rules across the entire grid. The approach is not complex enough to capture the subtle pattern transformations. The system struggles with problems requiring *contextual transformations* – where the transformation rule depends on the element's position within the grid or its neighboring elements. The system simplifies transformation rules, leading to incorrect outputs.
*   **Oversimplification of Transformations:** The LLM tends to oversimplify the transformation rules, leading to incorrect outputs. For example, in one failure, the correct solution requires inserting "4" or "7" in specific locations relative to the original elements, but the system fails to correctly place these new values in the correct contextual positions.

**4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS**

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Direct pattern matching would be more effective than explicit rule extraction.
    *   **Approach:** "Ensemble" approach - generate multiple plausible grids and select the best.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00. The LLM is unable to reliably infer and apply complex spatial and numerical transformations from a small number of training examples.
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis is rejected. The "ensemble" approach is not effective without a robust pattern recognition capability.
*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Explicitly prompting the LLM to extract and validate transformation rules will improve performance.
    *   **Approach:** Prompt the LLM to extract a transformation rule, then validate it, then apply it.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00. The LLM continues to struggle with identifying and representing complex transformation rules, even with explicit guidance and validation steps.
    *   **Finding:** Explicit rule extraction alone is insufficient. Validation alone isn't sufficient to overcome issues in rule extraction.
*   **Iteration 2:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Localized contextual analysis of the grid transformations will improve the accuracy. Focus on how the immediate neighbors of a cell influence its transformation.
    *   **Approach:** Prompt the LLM to analyze the training examples by focusing on the immediate context (neighbors) of each cell in the grid. The LLM will then generate a transformation rule based on these localized relationships and apply it to the test input.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that focusing on localized contextual analysis would be sufficient for solving grid transformation problems is **rejected**.
*   **Iteration 3:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Breaking down the grid transformation into individual element transformations is a sufficient approach.
    *   **Approach:** Adapt `analyze_elements` to transform each element separately based on the other training input/output pairs.
    *   **Result:** Accuracy 0.00.
    *   **Finding:** The experiment rejects the hypothesis that breaking down the grid transformation into individual element transformations is a sufficient approach for this dataset, due to the contextual relationships between the grid elements. The system's inability to capture these dependencies led to a complete failure (0% accuracy). The reliance on LLM calls for analysis, transformation, and verification may be too brittle. The LLM struggles with accurately inferring and validating complex transformation rules, even with agent roles defined.

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

*   **Improve Pattern Recognition:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to explicitly identify and represent recurring patterns in the training examples. This could involve techniques like identifying motifs or common local transformations.
    *   Experiment with different LLM prompting strategies to encourage more accurate pattern identification.
*   **Enhance Shape and Dimensionality Control:**
    *   Implement checks to ensure that the generated output grid has the correct shape and dimensions.
    *   Consider using a more structured output format to make it easier to enforce these constraints.
*   **Refine Local Context Analysis:**
    *   Increase the size of the "local context" window to capture dependencies on more distant cells.
    *   Add a mechanism to identify and prioritize the most relevant contextual factors for each cell.
*   **Explore Hybrid Approaches:**
    *   Combine the LLM-based approach with more traditional algorithms for pattern recognition and grid manipulation. This could involve using the LLM to generate candidate transformations, and then using algorithms to verify and refine these transformations.
*   **Enhance Rule Extraction with Visual and Spatial Reasoning:** Given the visual nature of the grid transformations, explore approaches that explicitly incorporate visual and spatial reasoning capabilities. This could involve:
    *   *Incorporating computer vision techniques* to analyze the grids and identify relevant patterns.
    *   *Designing prompts that explicitly encourage the LLM to think about spatial relationships* between elements in the grid.
*   **Improve Rule Validation with Counterexamples:** Strengthen the rule validation process by generating counterexamples. After extracting a rule, the system should attempt to create input grids that would lead to incorrect outputs if the rule were applied. If such counterexamples are found, the rule should be rejected or refined.
*   **Iterative Refinement of Rules:** Implement an iterative refinement process where the system generates an initial rule, applies it to a subset of the training examples, and then analyzes the results to identify areas where the rule fails. This information can then be used to refine the rule and repeat the process.
*   **Break Down the Problem into Simpler Sub-Problems:** Instead of attempting to extract the entire transformation rule at once, break down the problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. For example, the system could first try to identify which elements in the grid are changing and then focus on the rules governing those changes.
*   **Explore Alternative Model Architectures:** Experiment with model architectures that are better suited for visual reasoning tasks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or vision transformers. These models may be able to learn the underlying patterns in the grids more effectively than a standard LLM.
*   **Improve Pattern Extraction:**
    *   Refine the prompt to encourage more accurate pattern extraction.
    *   Experiment with different prompt structures.
    *   Include more explicit guidance on identifying relationships between input and output grids (e.g., "Look for patterns involving cell coordinates," or "Describe the transformation in terms of mathematical operations").
*   **Focus on Dimensionality:**
    *   Add constraints to the prompt to ensure the generated output grid has the correct dimensions.
    *   Provide examples of how input grid dimensions relate to output grid dimensions in the training data.
*   **Explicit Rule Extraction:**
    *   Explore a hybrid approach that combines pattern matching with explicit rule extraction.
    *   Have the LLM first attempt to identify explicit rules (e.g., "If a cell in the input grid is X, the corresponding cell in the output grid is Y") before generating candidate output grids.
*   **Few-Shot Learning with Augmented Examples:**
    *   Increase the number of training examples to provide more context for the LLM.
    *   Generate synthetic examples covering a wider range of transformations.
*   **Output Formatting Constraint:**
    *   Explicitly instruct the LLM to output ONLY the grid as a nested list of lists, without any surrounding text, code blocks, or explanations. This will prevent the "code generation" failure mode.
*   **Transformation Rule Validation:**
    *   Crucially, the LLM needs to *explicitly state* the transformation rule in a human-readable way. This allows for verification and debugging.
*   **Output Grid Verification:**
    *   Check that the output grid has the expected dimensions and that the values are within the valid range.
*   **Intermediate Representations:**
    *   A clear, natural language description of the inferred transformation is critical. This serves as an interpretable intermediate representation. Example: "Each number in the input grid is replaced with a 3x3 block of the same number."
*   **Template-Based Generation:**
    *   Use templates to guide the LLM in generating the output grid. For example, if the LLM determines that the grid is expanded by a factor of 3, use a template to generate the expanded grid with placeholders for the values, and then fill in the values based on the inferred transformation. This reduces the risk of formatting errors.
*   **Adapt `analyze_elements`:** Adapt the `analyze_elements` function to consider the *position and neighborhood* of each element. Instead of just focusing on unique element transformations, incorporate spatial context into the analysis.
*   **Handle Complex Transformations:** The system needs to be able to handle *complex transformations* rules beyond single element changes. The transformations need to model the element-wise changes and consider context.
*   **Improve Generalization:** Explore strategies for *improving generalization*. One approach would be to augment the training data with variations of the existing examples, forcing the model to learn more robust transformation rules. Another would be to provide richer contextual information to the LLM during the analysis and transformation steps.
*   **Replace LLM Calls:** Consider replacing the LLM calls in verification and transformation with a more reliable function based on the context.
        

            
        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            TOP PERFORMING APPROACHES TO BUILD UPON:
            
            

            PREVIOUSLY ATTEMPTED VARIATIONS:
            

            EXPLOITATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the error patterns, targeted improvements, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. CRITICAL: Break down the problem into distinct reasoning steps before modifying code
            3. CRITICAL: Analyze the best scripts to identify which components are working well and which are failing. Focus your improvements on the weak points while preserving successful components.
            4. Maintain the core successful elements of the best approaches
            5. Consider how you can combine strengths from multiple top-performing approaches
            6. CRITICAL: Add EMBEDDED EXAMPLES to EVERY LLM prompt that illustrate:
               - Sample input that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            7. Focus on fixing specific issues identified in previous error analyses. Create an explicit HYPOTHESIS for each targeted improvement, as well as a way to verify if it's successful.
            8. Enhance chain-of-thought reasoning and verification steps. Verification steps should be added to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            9. Apply the key insights from ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS to enhance the approach
            10. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment

            IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY:
            Analyze why the top approaches succeeded where others failed. Identify the key differentiators and strengthen them further.

            SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT APPROACH:
            1. First, identify which specific function or component is underperforming based on error analysis
            2. Examine how error cases differ from successful cases
            3. For each identified weakness, implement a targeted enhancement
            4. Add additional verification steps around modified components
            5. Consider how components interact - ensure improvements don't break successful parts

            Consider enhancing the script with one or more of these patterns:
            - Repeated validation with feedback loops
            - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
            - Dynamic input-dependent routing
            - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
            - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
            - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
            - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
            - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLOITATION phase:
            - Build upon what's working well in the best approaches
            - Consider creative combinations of successful techniques from different scripts
            - Make TARGETED improvements to address specific error patterns
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply the knowledge from our accumulated learnings
            - Significantly enhance the script to address weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your improvements
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

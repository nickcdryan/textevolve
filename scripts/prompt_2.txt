        You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
        You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. Carefully and fairly evaluate whether the hypothesis should be accepted, rejected, re-tested, or something else, making reference to specific outputs, reasoning steps, error messages, or other evidence from the exectuion. You may test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 

        You should try NEW THINGS:

        Break down the problem into smaller pieces
        Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
        Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

        # YOUR TASK
        You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
        Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
        Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
        Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
        Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
        THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.


        Here are example problems from previously seen data. YOUR APPROACH MUST BE DIFFERENT THAN THESE:

        HISTORICAL CONTEXT. YOUR APPROACH MUST ALSO BE DIFFERENT THAN THESE:
        APPROACH SUMMARIES FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
Iteration 1 (Exploitation, Accuracy: 0.00): The script solves grid transformation problems using a multi-stage LLM pipeline involving rule inference, application, and verification. It decomposes the problem into extracting grids, inferring a transformation rule from training examples, applying the rule to a test grid, and verifying the result. The script utilizes specialized agent roles such as a pattern identifier, rule applier, and meticulous verifier to complete the task. The functions used are `call_llm` to interact with the LLM, `extract_grid` to extract the grid from the given text, and `main` to orchestrate the whole process. The `main` function calls `extract_grid` to get the grid data, calls `call_llm` multiple times to infer, transform and verify the data, then returns the transformed grid.
Iteration 0 (Exploration, Accuracy: 0.00): The script solves grid transformation problems using a multi-stage LLM pipeline. It decomposes the problem into extracting training grids and the input grid, inferring the transformation rule using a "pattern expert" agent, applying the rule to the input grid using a "transformation expert" agent, and verifying the resulting grid using a "verification expert" agent. The `call_llm` function interacts with the Gemini LLM. The `extract_grid` function is used to extract the input grid from the question, and `main` orchestrates the entire process, calling `call_llm` to infer rules, apply transformations, and verify results. The overall workflow involves extracting relevant grids, inferring transformation rules, applying them, and verifying the output to ensure a correct transformation.

    TRACE INSIGHTS:
    ## EXECUTION PATTERN ANALYSIS

The primary failure pattern is the inability to correctly transform the input grid based on the provided training examples. This manifests as a "Verification failed" error, indicating a mismatch between the LLM's transformed grid and the expected answer.  The `extract_grid` function also appears to be flawed based on the regex. While the LLM demonstrates some capability to identify patterns, it struggles with applying them consistently and accurately, especially when the rules are complex or involve multiple conditions.  The verification step highlights inconsistencies in the transformation process.

## SUCCESS FACTORS

The `call_llm` function successfully interfaces with the Gemini API. The overall structure of the `main` function, which divides the task into extraction, inference, application, and verification, is a sound approach. The prompt engineering shows attempt to use chain-of-thought with roles.

## FAILURE POINTS

1.  **Incorrect Grid Extraction:** The `extract_grid` function uses the regex `r'\[.*?\n.*?\]'` which is incorrect. This is causing the system to not extract the full grid.

    *   **File:** `main.py`
    *   **Function:** `extract_grid`
    *   **Line:** The regex pattern is wrong. It should be updated to correctly capture multi-line grids, including the square brackets. The current expression is too specific and may miss grids that don't exactly match its narrow criteria.
2.  **Inaccurate Pattern Recognition:** The LLM struggles to accurately identify and formalize the underlying transformation rule based on the training examples. This leads to incorrect application of the rule in subsequent steps.  The identified rules often lack precision and fail to capture all the nuances of the transformations.

    *   **File:** `main.py`
    *   **Function:** `main` (LLM call for rule inference)
    *   **Example:** In Sample 0, the LLM identifies the rule as "examining the elements in the input grid and conditionally changing specific elements based on their position relative to other elements, and based on their values." This rule is too vague and doesn't provide concrete steps for the transformation.
3.  **Flawed Rule Application:** Even when a rule is identified, the LLM struggles to consistently apply it to the test input grid. This might be due to ambiguities in the rule's formulation or difficulties in translating the rule into a series of actionable steps.

    *   **File:** `main.py`
    *   **Function:** `main` (LLM call for rule application)
    *   **Example:** In Sample 1, even after stating the transformation involves replacing '5' with a new value based on column position, the final transformation is incorrect, indicating a failure to apply this rule accurately.
4.  **Ineffective Verification:** The verification step often fails to identify discrepancies between the transformed grid and the expected answer. This might be due to a lack of rigor in the verification logic or an inability to accurately assess the correctness of the transformation.

    *   **File:** `main.py`
    *   **Function:** `main` (LLM call for verification)
    *   **Example:**  In all incorrect samples, the verification outputs "Error: Verification failed. The grid does not match transformation rule". The reasoning is too broad and doesn't provide detailed feedback.

## CODE-LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  **Fix Grid Extraction Regex:**  Modify the `extract_grid` function's regex to correctly capture the grid.

    ```python
    def extract_grid(text):
        """Extract the grid from the input text using regex."""
        match = re.search(r'\[\[.*?\]\]', text, re.DOTALL)
        if match:
            return match.group(0)
        return None
    ```
    The expression `r'\[\[.*?\]\]'` is an improvement but can still be too greedy. A more precise approach is `r'(\[[\s\S]*?\])'`.

## PROMPT ENGINEERING RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  **Enhance Rule Inference Prompt:**  Provide the LLM with more explicit guidance on how to identify and formalize the transformation rule. Encourage it to break down the transformation into a series of smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of asking for a single rule, request a numbered list of actions to perform.

    ```python
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert at identifying patterns in grid transformations.

    Here are examples of grid transformations:
    ... (training examples) ...

    Describe the transformation rule as a numbered list of steps. Each step should be a specific action to perform on the grid.
    For example:
    1. If a cell contains the value X, replace it with Y.
    2. For each row, shift all values to the left by one position.
    """
    ```
2.  **Refine Rule Application Prompt:**  Provide the LLM with the input grid and the inferred rule in a clear and structured format. Encourage it to show its work by explicitly stating the steps it is taking to apply the rule. You can explicitly use the numbered steps it identified in previous turn.

    ```python
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert at applying grid transformation rules.

    Input Grid:
    {input_grid_text}

    Transformation Rule:
    {transformation_rule}

    Apply the transformation rule to the input grid, showing each step explicitly.
    For each step, state the action being performed and the resulting grid.
    """
    ```
3.  **Improve Verification Prompt:**  Provide the LLM with the original input grid, the transformed grid, and the expected answer. Ask it to compare the transformed grid to the expected answer, highlighting any discrepancies.  Encourage it to explain its reasoning in detail. Specifically, have it list the differences it finds rather than giving a general 'invalid' statement.

    ```python
    prompt = f"""
    You are a meticulous grid transformation verifier.

    Original Input Grid:
    {input_grid_text}

    Transformed Grid:
    {transformed_grid}

    Expected Answer:
    {expected_answer}

    Compare the transformed grid to the expected answer. List any differences you find.
    Explain your reasoning in detail.
    """
4.  **Prompt for intermediate grid output:** In the rule application prompt, ask the LLM to output the intermediate grid after each step of the transformation. This allows us to inspect which step is going wrong.

## HIGH LEVEL INSIGHTS

The system's primary weakness lies in its inability to consistently and accurately translate abstract patterns into concrete actions. The LLM struggles to move beyond identifying general trends to formulating precise, actionable rules. This is compounded by a lack of rigor in the verification step, which fails to catch inconsistencies and errors.

To improve the system, focus on enhancing the LLM's ability to reason about the transformations in a more structured and methodical way. Encourage it to break down complex transformations into smaller, more manageable steps. Provide it with clear and concise instructions on how to apply these steps. And ensure that the verification process is thorough and rigorous, capable of identifying even subtle discrepancies.

Consider these strategies to enhance performance:

*   **Introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach more explicitly:**  Encourage the LLM to verbalize its reasoning process in more detail at each stage. This can help to uncover hidden assumptions and biases.
*   **Implement a more robust verification mechanism:**  Instead of relying solely on the LLM's judgment, consider incorporating a set of objective criteria for evaluating the correctness of the transformation.
*   **Explore different LLM architectures or fine-tuning strategies:**  It's possible that the current LLM is not well-suited to this particular task. Experimenting with different models or fine-tuning the existing model on a dataset of grid transformation examples could lead to significant improvements. The model being used is `gemini-2.0-flash`, consider more powerful models such as `gemini-2.0-pro`.
*   **Explicitly State Reasoning Steps:** In the prompt, you can include an example of a grid and the steps required to solve it so the LLM has an example for how to solve these type of problems.


    ERROR ANALYSIS:
    ## RUNTIME ERRORS

The consistent runtime error observed across all error cases is "Error: Verification failed. The grid does not match transformation rule, result: INVALID". This indicates a problem in the `solution_verification` capability where the generated solution is consistently failing to align with the learned transformation rules. There are no JSONDecodeErrors or TypeErrors, suggesting that the basic parsing and data handling are functioning correctly.

## STRENGTHS

1.  **Reasoning Process:** The system attempts to explicitly outline the transformation rules by comparing input and output examples. In Sample ID 1, the system correctly identifies how to replace the first occurrences of "5" in specific columns with different numbers. This showcases an attempt to learn and apply a pattern.
2.  **Structured Output:** The system attempts to construct a final grid which shows it is understanding the need to format the answer in a certain way.

## WEAKNESSES

1.  **Inaccurate Rule Extraction:** Despite trying to reason about the grid transformations, the system frequently fails to extract the correct rules. The examples show that it struggles to generalize from the training examples to the test input.
2.  **Verification Failure:** The `solution_verification` module consistently reports that the generated grid is invalid. This reveals a potential problem in how the system evaluates its own solutions.

## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS

1.  **Faulty Rule Generalization:** The primary bottleneck lies in the system's ability to accurately generalize transformation rules from the training examples. It appears to either misinterpret the patterns or struggle to apply them correctly to new inputs.
2.  **Deficient Solution Verification:** The strict and possibly flawed verification process rejects many potentially valid solutions.

## ERROR PATTERNS

The recurring error pattern is the "Verification failed" message, suggesting a systematic issue with the `solution_verification` component. The messages and results often point to inaccuracies in the rules it is trying to apply to the generated grids.

## PRIMARY ISSUE

The single most critical problem is **inaccurate rule generalization**. The system needs a more robust and flexible method for learning and applying the underlying transformation rules. It is extracting the wrong rules from the training data, then incorrectly applying these rules to the test case.

## IMPROVEMENT AREAS

1.  **Rule Learning:** Enhance the `information_extraction` capability specifically for learning the transformation rules. It needs to identify relevant features and relationships between input and output grids.
2.  **Solution Verification:** Improve the `solution_verification` component to be more robust and less prone to false negatives.

## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS

1.  **Revised Rule Extraction:** Implement a more advanced rule extraction mechanism. Instead of simply identifying direct replacements, the system should consider relative positioning, context, and more complex transformations.
2.  **Debugging Prints:** Add print statements within the reasoning process, especially around the rule application and verification steps. This would allow for more detailed analysis of where the errors occur.
3.  **Looser Verification:** Relax the constraints in the `solution_verification` component to allow for more valid solutions to pass.
4.  **More Training Examples:** Augment the training set with more diverse examples to improve generalization.

## CAPABILITY MAPPING

*   **Sample ID 0:**
    *   information\_extraction: FAILED - Incorrectly infers transformation rules.
    *   solution\_verification: FAILED - Incorrectly flags the generated grid as invalid.
*   **Sample ID 1:**
    *   information\_extraction: FAILED - Identifies a replacement strategy but applies it incorrectly.
    *   solution\_generation: FAILED - The system generates only one line of the grid.
    *   solution\_verification: FAILED - Flags the partial grid as invalid.
*   **Sample ID 2:**
    *   information\_extraction: FAILED - Unable to infer the correct transformation rules.
    *   solution\_verification: FAILED - Flags the generated grid as invalid.

    === APPROACH #0 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===

    APPROACH SUMMARY:
    The script solves grid transformation problems using a multi-stage LLM pipeline. It decomposes the problem into extracting training grids and the input grid, inferring the transformation rule using a "pattern expert" agent, applying the rule to the input grid using a "transformation expert" agent, and verifying the resulting grid using a "verification expert" agent. The `call_llm` function interacts with the Gemini LLM. The `extract_grid` function is used to extract the input grid from the question, and `main` orchestrates the entire process, calling `call_llm` to infer rules, apply transformations, and verify results. The overall workflow involves extracting relevant grids, inferring transformation rules, applying them, and verifying the output to ensure a correct transformation.

    TRACE INSIGHTS:
    ## EXECUTION PATTERN ANALYSIS

The primary failure pattern is that the LLM struggles to consistently and correctly apply the inferred transformation rules to the input grids. This is evidenced by the "Verification failed" errors in all three incorrect samples. The `extract_grid` function seems to be working correctly, but the LLM's reasoning, application, and verification stages are inconsistent. There is evidence that the system is correctly identifying the transformations in the training examples but then failing to apply that transformation correctly in the evaluation case based on a novel input grid.

## SUCCESS FACTORS

The initial grid extraction using `extract_grid` appears to be successful in the provided traces. The LLM is capable of identifying patterns in the training examples. It is also capable of expressing those rules in a human-readable form. However, the critical issue is consistently and accurately applying the rule to transform the new input grid.

## FAILURE POINTS

1.  **Incorrect Sample 0:** The LLM correctly infers the transformation rule (removing the fourth column and summing rows). However, it then fails to correctly apply the rule in the application step. In the verification step, the transformed grid `[[2, 2, 2]]` clearly does *not* match the correct transformation for the input grid `[[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]]`.

2.  **Incorrect Sample 1:** The LLM infers a complex transformation rule (repeating pattern from non-zero elements). The LLM fails to follow through with the reasoning it stated. This leads to an incorrect transformed grid. The verification step detects the mismatch.

3.  **Incorrect Sample 2:** The LLM infers a "push-down" operation but incorrectly applies it to the input grid, which leads to a different outcome than what was anticipated. The LLM states that it correctly found the answer, which suggests a failure to reason about the answer.

The core problem lies in the LLM's ability to consistently and accurately apply the inferred transformation rule.

## CODE-LEVEL RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  **Refactor `main` to provide more context to the LLM.** Specifically, include the input grid, transformation rule, and transformed grid in the verification prompt. This allows the LLM to compare these elements directly and catch discrepancies.

2.  **No changes to `extract_grid` function needed** based on the traces.

## PROMPT ENGINEERING RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  **Refine the "Transformation Rule" identification prompt:**

    *   **Include a "Think Step by Step" instruction.** This encourages the LLM to break down the transformation into smaller, more manageable steps.
    *   **Prompt for an example application of the rule to the first training example.** This forces the LLM to demonstrate its understanding of the rule.

    ```python
    def main(question):
        # ... (existing code) ...

        rule_prompt = f"""
            You are an expert at identifying patterns in grid transformations.

            Here are examples of grid transformations:

            {example2_text if example2_text else ""}

            Think step by step. What is the transformation rule that converts the Input Grid to the Output Grid?
            Also, show exactly how to apply the rule to the Input Grid from {example1_label}.

            Respond with the transformation rule and an example of its application.
        """
        transformation_rule_text = call_llm(rule_prompt)

        # ... (rest of the code) ...
    ```

2.  **Improve the "Apply Transformation Rule" prompt:**

    *   **Reiterate the "Think Step by Step" instruction.** This reinforces the need for a methodical approach.
    *   **Request the LLM to explicitly state each step of the transformation.**

    ```python
    def main(question):
        # ... (existing code) ...

        application_prompt = f"""
            You are an expert at applying grid transformation rules.
            Transformation Rule: {transformation_rule_text}

            Input Grid:
            {input_grid_text}

            Think step by step. Apply the transformation rule to the Input Grid.
            Explicitly state each step of the transformation.
        """
        transformed_grid_text = call_llm(application_prompt)

        # ... (rest of the code) ...
    ```

3.  **Strengthen the "Verification" prompt:**

    *   **Provide the original question, input grid, transformation rule, and the transformed grid.**
    *   **Ask the LLM to explicitly justify whether the transformed grid correctly implements the transformation rule on the input grid.**
    *   **Prompt to output "VALID" or "INVALID" only.**

    ```python
    def main(question):
        # ... (existing code) ...

        verification_prompt = f"""
            You are a meticulous grid transformation verifier.
            Question: {question}

            Input Grid: {input_grid_text}
            Transformation Rule: {transformation_rule_text}
            Transformed Grid: {transformed_grid_text}

            Does the Transformed Grid correctly implement the Transformation Rule on the Input Grid?
            Justify your answer step by step.

            Respond with either "VALID" or "INVALID" only.
        """
        verification_result = call_llm(verification_prompt)

        # ... (rest of the code) ...
    ```

## HIGH LEVEL INSIGHTS

The system needs to be more methodical in its reasoning and application of the transformation rules. The current approach relies too heavily on the LLM's ability to implicitly perform the transformation correctly. By explicitly prompting the LLM to break down the transformation into steps and justify its reasoning, we can improve the accuracy and reliability of the system. The key is to make the transformation process more transparent and verifiable. The system would also benefit from a more sophisticated error handling mechanism that can detect and recover from failures. By making the verification step more robust, we can catch errors before they propagate further down the pipeline.

The updated prompts aim to make the LLM more explicit about its reasoning process, which should lead to more accurate and reliable results. By emphasizing step-by-step thinking and explicit justification, we can improve the system's ability to solve these grid transformation problems.


    ERROR ANALYSIS:
    ## RUNTIME ERRORS
*   **Sample 0:** "Error: Verification failed. The grid does not match transformation rule" - This indicates a failure in the `solution_verification` capability. No explicit runtime error is present, but the logic within the verification is faulty.
*   **Sample 1:** "Error: Verification failed. The grid does not match transformation rule" - Similar to sample 0, indicates a `solution_verification` failure. This output contains the string values rather than numerical values.
*   **Sample 2:** No explicit runtime error, but the system provides an incomplete grid. This can be considered an implicit runtime error stemming from the system's inability to properly produce the correct format for the grid.

## STRENGTHS

1.  **Column Removal (Sample 0):** The system correctly identified a pattern of removing the fourth column consisting only of 5s.
2.  **JSON Output (Sample 1):** The system attempts to provide detailed information in a structured JSON format, including the original grid, transformed grid, and other potentially relevant information. Even though the JSON contains errors (string vs int) the fact it's generating the JSON itself is a strength
3.  **Error Detection (All Samples):** The system correctly identifies that its generated output does not match the expected transformation rule, indicating a functional error detection mechanism.

## WEAKNESSES

1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system struggles to accurately identify complex patterns in the input/output grid transformations. It oversimplifies the rules, leading to incorrect transformations.
2.  **Data Type Handling:** Sample 1 shows inconsistencies in data type handling, with the transformed grid containing strings instead of integers.
3.  **Output Format:** Sample 2 generates an incomplete grid, showcasing inconsistencies in output format.

## CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS

1.  **Pattern Recognition:** The system's primary bottleneck is its inability to accurately recognize and apply the underlying transformation patterns present in the training examples. The system is failing in `information_extraction` and then as a result failing at `solution_generation`.
2.  **Solution Verification:** The verification step identifies discrepancies, but the system's reasoning for correcting the solution is flawed (Sample 0).

## ERROR PATTERNS

*   **Incorrect Transformations:** The system consistently fails to generate the correct transformed grid, indicating a failure in understanding the transformation rule.
*   **Verification Failures:** The verification mechanism identifies errors but fails to trigger a correct solution generation. This is a symptom of the underlying pattern recognition problem.

## PRIMARY ISSUE

The most critical problem is the system's inability to learn and accurately apply transformation rules based on the provided training examples. This stems from a weak `information_extraction` capability, hindering its ability to then perform `solution_generation`.

## IMPROVEMENT AREAS

1.  **Pattern Recognition:** Improve the system's ability to identify and generalize patterns from the training examples.
2.  **Solution Verification:** Enhance the verification mechanism to not only identify errors but also guide the solution generation process toward a correct output.
3.  **Data Type Handling:** Ensure consistent data type handling throughout the transformation process.

## IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS

1.  **Enhanced Pattern Recognition Algorithms:** Implement more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithms (e.g., convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks) that can effectively learn from the grid data.
2.  **Debugging and logging:** Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong
3.  **Constraint-Based Reasoning:** Integrate constraint-based reasoning techniques to ensure that generated solutions adhere to the identified patterns.
4.  **Data Type Validation:** Add explicit data type validation steps to ensure that all grid values are integers.
5.  **Test Case Variety:** Increase the variety and complexity of test cases to expose and address potential weaknesses in the system's reasoning and transformation logic.

## CAPABILITY MAPPING

*   **Sample 0:**
    *   `information_extraction`: Failed to correctly extract the transformation rule.
    *   `solution_generation`: Generated an incorrect solution.
    *   `solution_verification`: Identified an error but failed to correct it.
*   **Sample 1:**
    *   `information_extraction`: Failed to correctly extract the transformation rule.
    *   `solution_generation`: Generated an incorrect solution with data type inconsistencies.
    *   `solution_verification`: Identified an error.
*   **Sample 2:**
    *   `information_extraction`: Failed to correctly extract the transformation rule.
    *   `solution_generation`: Generated an incomplete solution.

MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        - This pattern is especially effective for problems with multiple valid solution paths
        - You can filter reasoning paths before the final decision based on consistency with examples
        - For critical applications, add verification to each reasoning path

           {problem}

           Make this approach different from typical solutions by [diversity instruction].
           ```

        2. Test each solution against examples:

        - Visual puzzles: shapes, positions, colors, transformations
        - Math problems: equations, constraints, variables, relationships
        - Logic puzzles: rules, constraints, entities, relationships

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Customize feature types based on your specific domain
        - Provide examples of good feature extraction
        - Consider different levels of abstraction
        - Features should simplify downstream processing
        


        # Pattern Identification Template

        ## Example Prompt Structure
        ```
        Examine these examples and identify all underlying patterns:

        Examples:
        [Example 1]
        [Example 2]
        [Example 3]

        For each pattern you identify:
        1. Describe the pattern precisely
        2. Show how it applies to the examples
        3. Explain how this pattern could be used

        Consider these types of patterns:
        - [Pattern type 1 relevant to domain]
        - [Pattern type 2 relevant to domain]
        - [Pattern type 3 relevant to domain]
        ```

        ## Pattern Types to Consider:
        - Spatial: position, size, symmetry, rotation, reflection
        - Transformation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, inversion
        - Sequence: repetition, alternation, progression, recursion
        - Visual: color, shape, size, orientation, grouping
        - Logical: conditionals, conjunctions, disjunctions, implications
        - Linguistic: syntax, semantics, structure, style, tone
        - Algorithmic: loops, conditionals, recursion, iteration
        - Psychological: motivation, emotion, belief, perception, cognition
        - Knowledge: facts, definitions, relationships, hierarchies, taxonomies
        - Structural: composition, decomposition, hierarchy, network, graph
        - Relational: cause, effect, correlation, comparison, contrast
        - Unknown: patterns that are not immediately obvious or familiar

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Encourage identification of multiple patterns
        - Ask for concrete examples of each pattern
        - Consider having the LLM rank pattern likelihood
        - Test identified patterns before applying them
        


        # Wait Injection Pattern

        ## Example Structure
        1. Get initial reasoning:
           ```
           Solve this problem step by step:
           {problem}
           ```

        2. Inject wait and reconsideration:
           ```
           Solve this problem step by step:
           {problem}

           {initial_reasoning_part}
           ...wait... let me reconsider this...

           [Reconsideration instruction]
           ```

        ## Reconsideration Instructions:
        - "Are there assumptions I made that might not be valid?"
        - "Is there a simpler approach I overlooked?"
        - "Let me check my logic carefully on the previous steps"
        - "Let me consider this problem from a different angle"

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Timing is critical - inject wait during critical reasoning
        - Customize reconsideration prompts to address common pitfalls
        - Experiment with multiple wait points for complex problems
        - Can be combined with perspective switching
        - "...wait..." token injection shown to trigger re-evaluation in LLMs
        


        # Hypothesis Testing Pattern

        ## Example Structure
        1. Generate multiple hypotheses:
           ```
           Generate {n} different hypotheses about the pattern in this problem:
           {problem}

           For each hypothesis:
           - State what the pattern might be
           - Explain your reasoning
           - Predict how it would apply to new examples
           ```

        2. Test each hypothesis against examples:
           ```
           Test these hypotheses:
           [List of hypotheses]

           Against these examples:
           [List of examples]

           For each hypothesis and example:
           - Apply the hypothesis
           - Check if the result matches the expected output
           - Note any discrepancies
           ```

        3. Refine based on results:
           ```
           Based on the testing results, refine the most promising hypothesis:
           [Testing results]

           Create an improved hypothesis that addresses any failures.
           ```

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Generate diverse hypotheses, not minor variations
        - Use examples that can distinguish between hypotheses
        - Consider combining elements from multiple hypotheses
        - Explicit refinement steps are critical for improvement

        '''

        final_solution = generate_solution(synthesis_prompt, temperature=0.3)
        ```

        ## Implementation Notes
        - The memory buffer stores solution attempts, evaluations, and metadata
        - Solution refinement is guided by accumulated feedback
        - Memory creates continuity across iteration cycles
        - Memory can be structured to track different aspects (reasoning paths, errors, successful patterns)
        - Can add filtering to maintain diversity in the memory buffer
        - Memory can persist across different problems to build general knowledge
        - Consider memory management strategies for large buffers

           [Initial solution]
           [Critique]
           [Defense/refinement]

           Provide an improved solution that incorporates valid points from both sides.
           ```

        ## Implementation Notes

        - Focus critique on different aspects (correctness, efficiency, completeness)
        - Use explicit resolution criteria for synthesis
        


        # Comprehensive Verification Pattern

        ## Example Structure
        1. Perform multiple verification methods:
           - Logical consistency check
           - Test case verification
           - Alternative approach comparison
           - Edge case analysis

        2. Example logical check:
           ```
           Verify if this solution is logically consistent:
           {solution}

           Check for:
           - Internal contradictions
           - Unwarranted assumptions
           - Logical fallacies
           ```

        3. Example test case check:
           ```
           Apply this solution to this test case:

           Solution: {solution}
           Test case: {test_case}

           Does it produce the expected result?
           ```

        4. Create verification summary:
           ```
           Based on all verification results:
           [Verification results]

           Is the solution verified? If not, what specific issues need to be addressed?
           ```

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Customize verification methods to your domain
        - Always include feedback for failed verification
        - Consider confidence weighting for different methods
        - Include both syntactic and semantic verification
        


        # Self-Consistency Checking Pattern

        ## Example Structure
        1. Generate multiple independent solutions:
           ```
           Solve this problem:
           {problem}

           Provide a complete solution with your reasoning.
           ```

           (Repeat for multiple solutions)

        2. Extract answers from solutions:
           ```
           Extract the final answer from your solution.
           ```

        3. Check consistency across answers:
           ```
           Analyze these different answers to the same problem:
           [List of answers]

           Are they consistent? If not, which is most likely correct and why?
           ```

        ## Implementation Notes
        - Use different prompting for each solution attempt
        - Consider majority voting for consistent answers
        - For inconsistent results, analyze reasoning paths
        - Can be combined with verification of each solution
        


        # Pattern Combination Guide

        Patterns can and should be combined for complex tasks. Here are effective combinations:

        ## Verification + Generation Patterns
        - Apply verification to any generation pattern
        - Use feedback from verification to guide regeneration
        - Example: Few-shot learning with verification feedback loop

        ## Multi-Perspective + Debate
        - Generate perspectives from different experts
        - Have experts debate their approaches
        - Synthesize the best elements from the debate

        ## ReAct + Verification
        - Verify each action before proceeding
        - Use verification feedback to guide next actions
        - Add reflection steps between actions

        ## Chain of Thought + Wait Injection
        - Insert wait points during complex reasoning steps
        - Use wait points to reconsider assumptions
        - Continue chain of thought after reconsideration

        ## Data Analysis + Hypothesis Testing
        - Use data analysis to generate initial hypotheses
        - Test hypotheses systematically
        - Refine based on test results

        ## Creative Combinations
        Don't limit yourself to these suggestions! Experiment with novel combinations:
        - Start with data analysis, use expert panel to interpret, debate approaches, implement with ReAct
        - Generate hypotheses, verify with self-consistency, refine with expert feedback
        - Extract features, perform multi-perspective analysis, implement with verification loops

        The key is to match pattern combinations to the specific challenges of your task.
        


        # Pattern Adaptation Guide

        These patterns are starting points, not rigid prescriptions. Here's how to adapt them:

        ## Prompt Engineering
        - Adjust detail level based on task complexity
        - Modify tone and style to fit domain context
        - Add domain-specific terminology and concepts
        - Customize examples to match your specific task

        ## Function Logic
        - Simplify patterns for straightforward tasks
        - Expand patterns for complex reasoning
        - Modify verification criteria based on importance
        - Adjust number of iterations or perspectives based on needs

        ## Implementation Variants
        - Text-only implementations for pure LLM interaction
        - Hybrid implementations that combine LLM with code logic
        - Multi-stage pipelines that apply different patterns sequentially
        - Parallel implementations that generate multiple approaches

        ## Key Questions for Adaptation
        1. What's unique about my specific task?
        2. Which parts of the pattern are most relevant?
        3. What additional steps or checks are needed?
        4. How can I make the pattern more efficient for my context?

        Remember: These patterns are tools to be wielded creatively, not constraints!
        


        # Example: Adapting and Combining Patterns

        ## Original Task
        Solving grid pattern problems by identifying abstract transformation rules.

        ## Pattern Selection and Adaptation

        1. Start with Data Analyzer to understand grid structure:
        ```python
        # Customize the Data Analyzer pattern for grid analysis
        grid_analysis_prompt = f'''
        Analyze these grid transformation examples:
        {examples}

        Focus specifically on:
        - Spatial relationships in the grid
        - Transformation rules between input and output
        - Pattern constraints and edge cases
        - Potential algorithms for transformation
        '''

        analysis = call_llm(grid_analysis_prompt)
        ```

        2. Apply Pattern Identification with domain customization:
        ```python
        # Adapt the Pattern Identification template for grid transformations
        pattern_prompt = f'''
        Identify transformation patterns in these grid examples:
        {examples}

        For each example, analyze these aspects:
        - Cell-to-cell transformations
        - Row/column operations
        - Shape preservation or alteration
        - Color or value changes
        - Positional shifts or rotations

        Describe each pattern precisely and show how it applies.
        '''

        patterns = call_llm(pattern_prompt)
        ```

        3. Combine with Hypothesis Testing:
        ```python
        # Generate hypotheses about transformation rules
        hypothesis_prompt = f'''
        Based on these identified patterns:
        {patterns}

        Generate 3 different hypotheses about the transformation rules.
        For each hypothesis:
        - Clearly state the transformation rule
        - Explain how it works on each example
        - Predict what would happen with different inputs
        '''

        hypotheses = call_llm(hypothesis_prompt)

        # Test each hypothesis
        for hypothesis in parse_hypotheses(hypotheses):
            verification_prompt = f'''
            Test this hypothesis against all examples:
            {hypothesis}

            Examples:
            {examples}

            For each example, show whether the hypothesis:
            - Correctly predicts the transformation
            - Fails to explain some aspect
            - Needs refinement (and how)
            '''

            verification = call_llm(verification_prompt)
            hypothesis_results.append(verification)
        ```

        4. Add Verification with Feedback Loop:
        ```python
        # Apply best hypothesis to new problem with verification
        for attempt in range(max_attempts):
            solution = apply_best_hypothesis(new_problem, best_hypothesis)

            verification_prompt = f'''
            Verify this solution:
            {solution}

            Check:
            - Does it follow the established transformation rule?
            - Are there any errors in application?
            - Is the output grid format correct?

            Return specific feedback on any issues.
            '''

            verification = call_llm(verification_prompt)

            if is_valid(verification):
                return solution

            # Refine with feedback
            refinement_prompt = f'''
            Refine this solution based on feedback:

            Solution: {solution}
            Feedback: {extract_feedback(verification)}

            Create an improved solution addressing all issues.
            '''

            solution = call_llm(refinement_prompt)
        ```

        ## Key Adaptation Points
        - Added grid-specific terminology to all prompts
        - Modified pattern identification to focus on spatial relationships
        - Added grid-specific hypotheses and testing
        - Customized verification criteria for grid transformations
        - Combined four different patterns in a cohesive workflow

=== INITIAL DATASET ANALYSIS [2025-05-06 21:50:16] ===

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Grid Structure:** Questions are presented as grid transformation tasks. Each task includes training examples of input/output grid pairs, followed by a test input grid that needs to be transformed. Grids are represented as nested lists of integers enclosed in square brackets within the text.
*   **Transformation Logic:** The transformation rules are implicit and must be inferred from the training examples. These rules can involve changes based on cell values, positions, or relationships between cells. The complexity of transformations varies. Some examples have simple changes, while others have complex patterns that involve many locations.
*   **Consistent Format:** All training examples and test cases follow a similar text-based format, including labels like "Input Grid," "Output Grid," and "TEST INPUT," making it easier to parse for grid data but harder to parse the underlying rules.
*   **Patterns in Questions:**
    *   All questions follow a consistent format: "Grid Transformation Task\n\n=== TRAINING EXAMPLES ===\n\nExample 1:\nInput Grid:\n...\nOutput Grid:\n...\n\n=== TEST INPUT ===\n...\nTransform the test input according to the pattern shown in the training examples."
    *   The structured format with labeled training examples (Input/Output Grids) and a "TEST INPUT" grid is ripe for targeted parsing.
    *   The training examples provide input-output pairs to illustrate the transformation rule.
    *   The core task is to infer the transformation rule from the examples and apply it to the test input. The core task involves discerning and applying patterns related to spatial relationships and value transformations within grids. This differs from tasks that focus on relationships *between* grids.
    *   The training examples aim to demonstrate the transformation rule. They are visually clear and well-defined. The test input is almost always a novel variation of these training examples.
    *   Questions tend to vary in grid sizes, number of training examples, and complexity of the transformation rule.

*   **Patterns in Answers:**
    *   Answers are always grid structures, represented as lists of lists.
    *   The numbers within the grids are typically integers.
    *   The answer grid's dimensions are dependent on the input grid and the inferred transformation.
    *   The answers directly reflect the application of the transformation rule to the test input.

*   **Structure and Format:**
    *   **Input:** Questions are text-based, containing structured information about the training examples and the test input, with grids formatted as lists of lists represented as strings.
    *   **Output:** Answers are grid structures in a string representation.
    *   Grids are typically represented as two-dimensional arrays of integers.

*   **Domain Knowledge:**
    *   **Spatial Reasoning:** Understanding how shapes, patterns, and arrangements change.
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying repeating sequences or relationships within the grids.
    *   **Logical Inference:** Deducing the transformation rule based on limited examples.
    *   **Array Manipulation:** Understanding how to access and modify elements within a grid.

*   **Question Types:**
    *   All questions are of the same general type: *grid transformation*. However, the specific transformations vary, leading to different sub-types:
        *   **Expansion and Value Replication:** Expanding the grid dimensions and repeating values (Example 0).
        *   **Value Modification based on Position/Neighbors:** Changing values based on their location or the values of adjacent cells (Example 1).
        *   **Complex Combination:** Combining aspects of expansion, replication, and conditional modification (Example 4).

*   **Reasoning Types:**
    *   **Inductive Reasoning:** Generalizing a rule from specific examples. This is core to all the examples.
    *   **Spatial Reasoning:** Understanding the relationships between grid elements.
    *   **Algorithmic Reasoning:** Formulating a step-by-step process to transform the grid.
    *   **Edge Case Handling:** Determining how the transformation applies to elements on the borders of the grid.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Multi-stage pipeline:** The high-level approach of decomposing the problem into rule inference, application, and verification is fundamentally sound because it follows the way humans solve the problem.
*   **Specialized Agent Roles:** Attempting to assign roles (pattern identifier, rule applier, verifier) is a promising direction. However, the prompt design requires improvement.
*   **Initial Grid Extraction:** The `extract_grid` function works well for extracting the grid data, which is essential for the subsequent processing. This successful extraction is a crucial foundation.
*   **Solution Strategies:**
    1.  **Pattern Matching and Rule Extraction:**
        *   Analyze the training examples to identify the changes between input and output grids.
        *   Formulate a symbolic representation of the transformation rule. This can be thought of as a short program or set of instructions.
    2.  **Transformation Simulation:**
        *   Implement the inferred rule as a series of operations on the grid.
        *   Apply the operations to the test input.
    3.  **Example-Based Reasoning:**
        *   Compare the test input to the training inputs to identify similar patterns.
        *   Adapt the transformation from the closest training example to the test input.
    4.  **Decomposition:** Break down the grid transformation into smaller, manageable sub-transformations.

*   **Decomposition:**
    1.  **Dimension Analysis:** Determine how the dimensions (rows and columns) of the grid change.
    2.  **Value Mapping:** Identify how individual values are transformed (e.g., 0 becomes 2, 1 becomes 2).
    3.  **Neighborhood Analysis:** Analyze how a cell's value is influenced by its neighbors.
    4.  **Rule Combination:** Combine these individual transformations to create the complete rule.

*   **Validation Techniques:**
    1.  **Symmetry Checks:** Verify if the transformation preserves or introduces symmetry in the grid.
    2.  **Value Distribution:** Analyze if the distribution of values changes in a predictable way.
    3.  **Visual Inspection:** (If possible) Display the transformed grid to check for obvious errors.
    4.  **Training example re-application:** Re-apply the inferred transformation to the training inputs. Do you get the training outputs?

*   **Text-Based Techniques:**

    Given the preference for text-based processing to avoid JSON parsing complexities, I suggest these specific techniques:

    1.  **Direct Pattern Extraction from Text:**
        *   Use regex or string manipulation to directly identify the grid dimensions and values from the input text.
        *   Write functions that operate on string representations of grids to extract relevant information.
    2.  **Symbolic Rule Encoding in Text:**
        *   Represent the inferred transformation rule in natural language as a string. For example:
            *   `"Each cell is multiplied by 2"`
            *   `"Expand grid 3x3. If cell value is X, replace with Y."`
        *   The LLM then uses this string description to perform the transformation.
    3.  **Step-by-Step Transformation Instructions:**
        *   Instead of a complex program, give the LLM a series of explicit instructions, like:
            1.  `"Read the input grid."`
            2.  `"Determine the grid's dimensions."`
            3.  `"For each cell, apply the following rule: ..."`
            4.  `"Construct the output grid with the transformed values."`
            5.  `"Format the output grid as a list of lists."`
    4.  **Few-Shot Learning with Demonstrations:**
        *   Augment the prompt with additional examples that demonstrate the step-by-step reasoning process. This can guide the LLM's reasoning and improve its performance.
    5.  **Output Formatting Prompts:**
        *   Provide the LLM with explicit instructions on how to format the output grid. For example:
            *   `"The output must be a string representation of a list of lists, with each inner list representing a row in the grid."`
            *   `"Use commas to separate the numbers in each row, and enclose each row in square brackets."`
        * **Contextualized Verification:** Give the LLM all the components (input, rule, transformed output) within the verification prompt. This helps it directly compare and evaluate correctness.
        *   **Example Application in Rule Prompt:** Make the LLM explicitly demonstrate how the inferred rule applies to one of the training examples *within the "rule identification" prompt*. This tests its understanding of the rule *before* it's applied to the test input.
    *    **Calling an LLM:** The `call_llm` is an effective tool to connect to the LLM.

By focusing on leveraging the LLM's natural language understanding and reasoning abilities, we can minimize the need for complex code generation and JSON parsing, leading to more robust and efficient solutions.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Difficulty Factors:**
    *   **Ambiguity:** The training examples may not fully specify the transformation rule, leading to multiple possible interpretations.
    *   **Abstraction:** The rules may be abstract and not directly related to the numerical values.
    *   **Complexity:** Some transformations involve intricate combinations of steps.
    *   **Limited Examples:** Often, only a few examples are provided, making generalization difficult.

*   **Edge Cases and Complexities:**
    *   **Grid Boundaries:** Rules might behave differently at the edges of the grid.
    *   **Varying Grid Sizes:** The rule may need to adapt to different input grid dimensions.
    *   **Nested Patterns:** The rule might involve multiple levels of pattern recognition (e.g., identifying sub-patterns within the grid).
    *   **Conditional Transformations:** Certain transformations may depend on specific conditions within the input grid.

*   **Reasoning Requirements:**
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying the core transformation being applied.
    *   **Abstraction:** Representing the transformation in a general, reusable form.
    *   **Rule Application:** Consistently applying the rule to the test input.
    *   **Verification:** Ensuring that the transformed grid adheres to the inferred rule.

*   **Rule Application Inconsistency:** The LLM can identify the transformation rule in training examples, but struggles to *consistently and accurately* apply that rule to the test input grid. This is the primary bottleneck.
    *   *Example (Incorrect Sample 0):* Correctly identifies the need to remove a column and sum rows, but then miscalculates or misapplies the summing operation. The reasoning chain goes wrong at the application phase.
*   **Vague Rule Application:** Even when a rule is identified, the LLM struggles to apply it consistently to the test input grid. This might be due to ambiguities in the rule's formulation or difficulties in translating the rule into a series of actionable steps.
*   **Lack of step-by-step Transformation:** The LLM struggles to break down a complex problem into a series of steps. This makes it difficult to trace the execution and fix the errors.
*   **Reasoning Errors and Verification Breakdown:** Even when the system identifies an error in its transformation (as in Incorrect Sample 0), it fails to correctly correct itself to produce a valid result. The verification step, even when flagging an error, doesn't trigger effective recovery. The verification process is ineffective due to its inability to identify specific discrepancies between the predicted and expected grids. The error messages are generic and don't offer specific debugging information.
*   **Inability to handle complex patterns involving repetitions:** The LLM fails to translate complex transformation rules into code (Incorrect Sample 1). This indicates difficulty in following the reasoning.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Iteration 0:**
    *   **Hypothesis: LLM can directly apply inferred rules => REJECTED.** The 0% accuracy directly confirms this. The initial assumption that the LLM can reliably apply the identified rule is clearly incorrect.
    *   **Hypothesis: Grid extraction is a solved problem => CONFIRMED.** `extract_grid` function is working as intended.

*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   **Hypothesis:** Decomposing the task into rule inference, application, and verification will lead to correct answers.
    *   **Result:** REJECTED. The accuracy is 0.0, indicating a failure to solve any of the grid transformation tasks. The errors in rule inference, application, and verification prevent the successful completion of the task.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Chain-of-thought combined with specialized roles will enable accurate solutions.
    *   **Result:** REJECTED. The zero accuracy suggests that the chain-of-thought approach, while promising, is not effectively implemented or is insufficient for the complexity of the transformations. The models need much more explicit prompting.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Prompt Engineering for Rule Extraction:** Improve the prompts used for rule inference. Ask the LLM to generate explicit, step-by-step instructions for applying the transformation, rather than a general description of the pattern.
*   **Prompt Engineering for Intermediate State Tracking:** Ask the LLM to output the intermediate state after each transformation. This will provide a better insight into which step is going wrong.
*   **Robust Verification:** Enhance the verification prompt. Instruct the LLM to highlight specific differences between the transformed grid and the expected grid.
*   **Implement Step-by-Step Transformation:** Enhance the prompt to force the LLM to explicitly break down the transformation rule into individual steps. The goal is to make the transformation process more transparent and debuggable.
*   **Error Recovery Mechanism:** Develop a mechanism to handle failed verifications. If verification fails, the system should re-prompt the "transformation" stage with an error message and potentially re-run the "rule inference" step as well.
*   **Prompt for VALID or INVALID:** The verification prompt should be adapted to ask to output "VALID" or "INVALID" only.
*   **Fine-tuning on Grid Transformation Examples:** Consider fine-tuning a more powerful LLM architecture (e.g., `gemini-2.0-pro`) on a dataset of grid transformation examples to improve its pattern recognition and rule application abilities.
*   **Data Augmentation:** Increase the number and diversity of training examples to improve the LLM's ability to generalize transformation rules.
*   **Unusual/Edge Case Handling:**
    *   **Default Values:** Define a default value to use when the rule cannot be applied (e.g., for out-of-bounds cells).
    *   **Conditional Logic:** Incorporate conditional statements into the rule to handle specific cases.
    *   **Exception Handling:** Catch and handle errors that occur during the transformation process.

*   **Creative Insights:**
    *   **Non-Obvious Patterns:**
        *   **Frequency Analysis:** Look at how often each number occurs in the input and output grids; this may reveal patterns or biases in the transformation.
        *   **Delta Grids:** Create a grid that represents the *difference* between the input and output grids. This can highlight the parts of the grid that are changing.
    *   **Unique Perspectives:**
        *   **Treating Grids as Images:** Use image processing techniques (blur, edge detection, etc.) to find patterns and transformations. This is only an analogy to guide the reasoning.
    *   **Analogies:**
        *   **Cellular Automata:** Drawing an analogy to cellular automata, where each cell updates based on its neighbors, might help in defining local transformation rules.
        *   **Image Resizing Algorithms:** Relate grid expansion to image resizing and use related algorithms.

*   **Implementation Recommendations:**
    *   **Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Rule Consistency:** Check that the inferred transformation rule is consistent across all training examples.
        2.  **Boundary Condition Testing:** Specifically test how the rule applies to elements near the grid boundaries.
        3.  **Intermediate State Inspection:** If possible, visualize the grid at intermediate steps during the transformation.

    *   **Intermediate Representations:**
        1.  **Symbolic Rule Representation:** Represent the inferred rule as a symbolic expression or a sequence of operations. Example: `"Expand grid by factor of 3. Replace 1 with 2."`
        2.  **Transformation Matrix:** If the transformation involves linear operations, use a transformation matrix. (Less likely to be helpful here).
        3.  **Heatmaps:** Visualize the changes in the grid with heatmaps to identify transformation hotspots.

            CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
            SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


            

        EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
        1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
        2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
        3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Carefully and fairly evaluate whether the hypothesis should be accepted, rejected, re-tested, or something else, making reference to specific outputs, reasoning steps, error messages, or other evidence from the exectuion.
        4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
        5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
           - Input example that resembles the dataset
           - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
           - Properly formatted output
        6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
        7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
        8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
           - Repeated validation with feedback loops
           - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
           - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
           - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
           - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
           - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
           - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
           - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

        Here's how to call the Gemini API. ONLY call it in this format and DO NOT make up configuration options!:
        def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

        Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
        - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. Carefully and fairly evaluate whether the hypothesis should be accepted, rejected, re-tested, or something else, making reference to specific outputs, reasoning steps, error messages, or other evidence from the exectuion.
        - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
        - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
          * Sample input similar to the dataset
          * Expected reasoning steps
          * Desired output format
        - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
        - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
        - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

        CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
        1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
        2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
        3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
        4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
           - Sample input with reasoning
           - Desired output format
        5. Make proper use of error handling
        6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
        7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

        Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
        1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
        2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
        3. Has proper error handling for API calls
        4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
        5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
        6. Closes all string literals properly

        This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

        BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

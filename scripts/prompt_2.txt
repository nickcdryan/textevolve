            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

    Design a data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:

    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓
    2. Delete operation: The solution uses the hashmap to find the index, then swaps with the last element and updates accordingly with O(1) time complexity ✓

    4. All operations have O(1) average time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            }
        ```

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

PREVIOUSLY TRIED APPROACHES (LAST 5 SCRIPTS):

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 1 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script uses LLM-based techniques with agent roles for information extraction, search query generation, answer extraction, and answer validation to answer questions. It decomposes the problem into extracting information, generating a search query, simulating search results using the LLM, extracting the answer, and validating the answer. The functions used are `call_llm`, `extract_information`, `generate_search_query`, `extract_answer`, `validate_answer`, and `main`. The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling the functions sequentially, starting with information extraction and ending with answer validation, using the output of one function as input to the next.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 0 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script uses an LLM to answer factual questions through iterative refinement, incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning and validation. The problem is decomposed into generating a search query, simulating information retrieval, extracting an answer with a confidence score, and validating the extracted answer. The agent roles involved are a search query generator, a question answering expert, and an answer validator. The script defines a `call_llm` function, which is used to call the Gemini LLM with different prompts, and a `main` function that orchestrates the entire process by calling `call_llm` multiple times to generate search queries, extract answers, and perform validation. The overall workflow is: question -> search query generation -> simulated information retrieval -> answer extraction -> validation -> final answer.

            LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, here's the updated and synthesized version of our learnings, focusing specifically on the given dataset and task. This document will serve as our evolving research log.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Factual and Specific Questions:** Questions are factual and seek specific pieces of information across a wide range of topics (music, chemistry, oceanography, bands, television).
*   **Emphasis on Proper Nouns and Named Entities:** Questions frequently contain proper nouns and specific dates, making them amenable to information retrieval. Answers are often short phrases, often consisting of one or a few proper nouns (names of people or things). Examples: "Who was the first cardiologist in Kashmir?" "Who murdered the supervillain Monsieur Mallah?".
*   **Question Types:** Primarily fact-retrieval questions asking for specific details about people, places, or things ("Who...", "What...").
*   **Need for Precise Factual Recall:** Questions require precise factual recall, often involving dates, numbers, or names (e.g., "Champions League semi-final match between Barcelona and Milan on April 27, 2006").
*   **Contextual Specificity:** Questions often contain specific contextual details (e.g., "Champions League semi-final match between Barcelona and Milan on April 27, 2006") to narrow the scope of the answer.
*   **Information Extraction Task:** The dataset tests the ability to extract *very specific* pieces of information from potentially larger contexts. It's not simply about broad topic understanding.
*   **"Who" questions requiring specific names:** Many questions (e.g., "Who was the first cardiologist in Kashmir?") require identifying specific individuals, making accurate name retrieval crucial.
*   **Questions requiring temporal context:** Some questions ("What day did India land its first spacecraft on the moon?", "Before the New 52, who murdered the supervillain Monsieur Mallah?") involve temporal qualifiers. This demands understanding of historical or fictional timelines to extract correct information.
*   **Questions expecting definitive answers:** The questions expect precise answers (specific dates, names), not general descriptions or related concepts.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Initial Attempts Ineffective:** The initial strategy of using an LLM for iterative refinement with a validation step resulted in 0% accuracy, indicating the need for significant improvements.
*   **Current Accuracy Very Low:** With an accuracy of 0.33, no current strategies can be considered effectively "working". The underlying framework shows potential but requires significant refinement.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Overly Strict Validation:** The primary failure mode is the "Could not be validated" response. This suggests the validation logic is too rigid.
    *   **Example:** The date question "Specify the day, month, and year..." could fail if the extracted answer includes the day of the week, even if the core date is correct.
*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding During Validation:** The validator likely struggles to relate the retrieved information to the specific constraints in the question.
    *   **Example:** For the corner kicks question, the validator might not be able to verify that the retrieved number of corners specifically relates to the *Barcelona* team, the *Champions League* match, and the specified date.
*   **Dependency on Perfect Information Retrieval:** The system's reliance on simulated retrieval means a slightly off search query can lead to no relevant information, and thus, a validation failure even if the LLM could have reasoned with broader knowledge.
*   **Ambiguity:** A question might have multiple possible answers depending on context.
*   **Synonyms/Paraphrasing:** The answer might be expressed differently in the source text than in the question.
*   **Misspellings/Typos:** Both in the question and the potential answer source.
*   **Cultural References:** Some questions may rely on understanding cultural or historical context that is not explicitly stated.
*   **Multiple entities with the same name:** disambiguation may be necessary.
*   **UnboundLocalError:** Error detected during script repair (attempt 1): cannot access local variable 'extracted_answer' where it is not associated with a value. This highlights the need for robust error handling and ensuring variables are properly initialized.
*   **Inability to resolve conflicting information:** In the "first cardiologist" question, the LLM extracted "Dr. Sheikh Jalal" instead of the correct "Dr Upendra Kaul," indicating a failure in discerning accurate information from potentially conflicting (simulated) search results. The system needs a more robust method for selecting the correct answer when multiple possibilities are presented in the search context.
*   **Failure to identify the correct entity in search results:** For the "Monsieur Mallah" question, the system returned "Unknown from search result" when the correct answer was "Gorilla Grodd." This suggests the model struggled to extract the specific entity (Gorilla Grodd) related to the murder event from the provided context, even if the information was present in the simulated search results. This can be due to named entity recognition failure, relationship extraction failure, or even failures in question understanding.
*   **Poor Simulated Search Results:** The low accuracy (0.33) reinforces the possibility that the simulated search results are not accurate or relevant enough, hindering both information extraction and validation.

## 4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS

*   **Experiment 0 (Initial Exploration):**
    *   **Strategy:** LLM-based iterative refinement with validation.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The initial configuration of prompts, validation logic, or information retrieval simulation is inadequate. The hypothesis that the LLM, with its inherent knowledge, can directly answer complex questions involving precise factual data and validation is rejected in its current form.
*   **Experiment 1 (Agent-based LLM Approach):**
    *   **Strategy:** Basic framework of information extraction, query generation, simulated search, answer extraction, and validation.
    *   **Result:** 0.33 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The agent-based LLM approach, in its current form, struggles with reasoning and information synthesis from (simulated) search results. The failure to accurately answer questions involving specific entities (names, dates) indicates a weakness in linking entities to the events described in the questions.
*   **Script Repair Errors:**
    *   **Error 1:** `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'extracted_answer' where it is not associated with a value`. Occurred during script repair attempt 1. Indicates a logic error where `extracted_answer` was used before being assigned a value.
    *   **Error 2 & 3:** "ERROR: Validation failure" during script repair attempts 2 & 3. This reinforces the issues with the overly strict validation process.

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Relax Validation Criteria:** Implement more flexible validation. Consider:
    *   Semantic similarity checks instead of exact string matching.
    *   Allowing for answers that contain more information than the minimal expected answer, as long as the core information is present and correct.
    *   Introducing a confidence score threshold for validation, where answers with high confidence, even if not perfectly matching the expected answer, are accepted.
*   **Improve Contextual Understanding in Validation:** Enhance the validation prompt to explicitly consider the context provided in the original question. For example, provide the validator with the original question and ask it to confirm that the extracted answer directly addresses all parts of the question (team, event, date, etc.).
*   **Evaluate Information Retrieval Simulation:** Examine the quality of the simulated information retrieval. Is the search query being generated effectively capturing the essence of the question? Does the "retrieved" information contain the answer (even if the extraction fails)? Consider adding a step to evaluate the quality of the retrieved information independently of the answer extraction.
*   **Implement Explicit Error Handling/Reporting:** Instead of simply outputting "Could not be validated," provide more detailed feedback on *why* the validation failed. This will help diagnose issues with the validation process itself and prevent similar errors (like the `UnboundLocalError`) in the future.
*   **Prompt Engineering for Answer Extraction:** Refine the prompt used for answer extraction. Ensure it clearly instructs the LLM to extract the *specific* information requested and to provide a confidence score.
*   **Address the `UnboundLocalError`:** Implement a default value for `extracted_answer` or refactor the code to guarantee it is always assigned before being used. Add logging to track the flow of execution and variable assignments.
*   **Focus on RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation):** Prioritize techniques that combine information retrieval with LLM generation to leverage external knowledge and reduce hallucination. Start with basic RAG and iteratively refine the retrieval and generation prompts.
*   **Improve Search Query Generation:** Refine the `generate_search_query` function to produce more targeted queries that specifically address the key entities and relationships in the question. For the "Monsieur Mallah" example, ensure the query explicitly targets the murderer.
*   **Enhance Answer Extraction with Contextual Reasoning:** Enhance the `extract_answer` function to consider the context within the simulated search results. Implement strategies to weigh different sources of information based on reliability or relevance, and to resolve conflicts between sources.
*   **Strengthen Validation Logic:** The `validate_answer` function needs more sophisticated logic to identify semantic equivalence. For example, it should be able to recognize that "Gorilla Grodd" is the murderer of Monsieur Mallah even if the search results don't explicitly state "Gorilla Grodd murdered Monsieur Mallah" but contain information strongly implying it.
*   **Data Augmentation with Known Facts:** Augment the simulated search results with known facts, or use an LLM specifically trained for QA to extract more accurate information. This is to overcome the issue of poor simulated search results.
*   **Implement Explicit Reasoning Steps:** Force the LLM to verbalize its reasoning steps (e.g., "I found X in source Y. Source Z contradicts this, but source Y is more reliable. Therefore, the answer is X."). This makes debugging and error analysis easier. This could be done in the prompt, or by adding another LLM step for this explicit reasoning.

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

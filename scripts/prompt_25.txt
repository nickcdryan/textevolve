            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

  {
    "iteration": 15,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's inability to accurately retrieve and synthesize factual knowledge from external sources and integrate it effectively through reasoning over generated sub-questions to produce a precise final answer. It also has issues with generating sensible prompts for the sub-questions."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 16,
    "issue": "The primary issue is a **deficient answer validation mechanism**. The current validation process seems to rely on superficial matching or lacks the capacity to deeply analyze the extracted answer in relation to the original question and constraints. This leads to false positives, where incorrect answers are deemed correct, preventing the system from engaging in error correction or further refinement."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 17,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's **reliance on internal knowledge and its lack of a robust mechanism for information retrieval and integration from external sources**. This is compounded by the system's limited capability to handle numerical values and semantic equivalence accurately."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 18,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the **inability to perform reasoning and inference** beyond direct lookups in the knowledge graph. This limitation restricts the system to only answering questions where the exact answer is explicitly stated, rather than implied or requiring any further processing."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 19,
    "issue": "The primary issue is **inaccurate and imprecise knowledge retrieval coupled with poor answer formulation.** The system appears to struggle with identifying the *exact* piece of information needed to answer the question and struggles to formulate a response that contains ONLY that information. This might be caused by the system failing to filter based on the question context."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 20,
    "issue": "The single most critical problem is **incorrect answer selection due to a failure to adequately rank or filter potential answers based on contextual information and temporal constraints**. The system is retrieving *some* relevant information but failing to pinpoint the *most accurate* answer within that set."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 21,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the **overly trusting nature of the solution verification process**, which leads to the validation of incorrect information extracted from search results. This is coupled with a **lack of critical assessment of the search results**."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 22,
    "issue": "The primary issue is **failure in reliable fact retrieval and validation**. The system extracts information from a source but fails to verify its correctness before presenting it as the final answer. This highlights a critical weakness in the system's ability to ground its reasoning in accurate, verifiable facts."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 23,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is **lack of a robust fact-verification mechanism**. The system retrieves or generates an answer without sufficiently checking its accuracy against multiple reliable sources or applying reasonableness checks."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 24,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is **inaccurate fact retrieval.** The system retrieves and presents information that is factually incorrect with respect to the question asked. This is evidenced by the incorrect spouse name in the error case."

]

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "The source reliability for the candidate answer.",
  "The presence of relevant keywords and entities.",
  "The fulfillment of any explicit or implicit constraints (e.g., temporal constraints, specific dates).",
  "Reject answers that fall outside of these ranges and try to find a more reasonable answer.",
  "After generating an initial answer, query multiple knowledge sources (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia, a custom knowledge base) for the same information.",
  "Semantic similarity between the answer and the question.",
  "Compare the answers from different sources. If there is significant disagreement, flag the answer as potentially incorrect and try to find a more reliable answer.",
  "For questions involving numerical values, identify reasonable ranges for the answer. For example, the depth of a lake is unlikely to be more than a few hundred meters.",
  "Use structured data more effectively:** If the underlying knowledge base contains structured data (e.g., tables, knowledge graphs), leverage this structure to improve the accuracy of knowledge retrieval. This involves designing queries that target specific fields and relationships within the structured data.",
  "Score each source based on its reliability (e.g., based on the number of citations or the reputation of the source)."

    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).

    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.

    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            return solution_result["solution"]

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

PREVIOUSLY TRIED APPROACHES (LAST 5 SCRIPTS):

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 24 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.67) ===
Approach: The script implements a QA system using two simulated knowledge bases (KB1 and KB2) and LLM-driven answer extraction and validation, using the `gemini-2.0-flash` model. The problem is decomposed into knowledge retrieval, answer extraction, and answer validation, with KB1 having higher authority in cases of conflict. The agent roles involved are a knowledge base simulator, an answer extractor, and a validator.

The functions used are:
1.  `call_llm`: Used to interface with the LLM for all tasks.
2.  `simulate_knowledge_base`: Simulates retrieving information from two knowledge bases, KB1 and KB2.
3.  `extract_answer`: Extracts the answer from the knowledge base results, giving precedence to KB1.
4.  `validate_answer`: Validates the extracted answer against the knowledge bases, also prioritizing KB1.
5.  `main`: Orchestrates the entire QA process.

The workflow starts with `main` calling `simulate_knowledge_base` twice to get results from KB1 and KB2, then calls `extract_answer` to extract an answer from these results, and then uses `validate_answer` to validate the extracted answer.

```python
import os
import re
import math

# Hypothesis: Answering factual questions using a LLM-driven QA system with dual knowledge base lookups (KB1 and KB2) and hierarchical answer validation where KB1 has greater influence and can override KB2.
# We will use two simulated knowledge bases, KB1 acting as a "primary" KB with greater authority, and KB2 as a "secondary" KB. We'll implement an LLM validator that trusts KB1 more than KB2 when there's a conflict.
# This is designed to test how hierarchical knowledge source influence impacts overall accuracy and robustness.

The functions used are `call_llm`, `simulate_search`, `extract_answer`, `reconcile_answers`, `validate_answer`, and `main`. `simulate_search` uses `call_llm` to simulate search engine results, then `extract_answer` uses `call_llm` to get an answer from each search result. `reconcile_answers` then takes all the answers and the original question and uses `call_llm` to create one answer. Lastly, `validate_answer` validates the reconciled answer.

The overall workflow involves simulating searches with multiple engines using `simulate_search`, extracting answers from each search result with `extract_answer`, reconciling the extracted answers into a single answer using `reconcile_answers`, validating the final answer using `validate_answer`, and then returning the validated answer or an error message.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 22 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.67) ===
Approach: The script uses an LLM to fact-check by simulating multiple search engines with different biases, extracting answers from each, reconciling the answers, and then validating the final answer. The problem is decomposed into simulating search, extracting answers, reconciling those answers, and then validating the reconciled answer. Different system instructions assign the LLM roles of search engine, answer extractor, reconciler, and validator.

*   `call_llm` is the base function that calls the LLM with a prompt and system instruction.
*   `simulate_search` generates search results for a given query using a simulated search engine.
*   `extract_answer` extracts answers from the simulated search results.
*   `reconcile_answers` combines the answers from the search engines to produce one answer.
*   `validate_answer` validates the reconciled answer to determine if it is correct.
*   `main` orchestrates the process, calling the search, extraction, reconcile, and validation functions.

The overall workflow involves simulating multiple searches, extracting answers from each search, reconciling them into a single answer, validating the answer, and returning the reconciled answer if it is valid.

Three agents are involved: a question transformation expert, a knowledge base, and an expert validator. The functions used are `call_llm` to interact with the LLM with `main` calling `call_llm` three times sequentially for question transformation, knowledge base retrieval, and verification.

*   **Emphasis on Proper Nouns and Named Entities:** Questions frequently contain proper nouns, specific dates, and locations, making them amenable to information retrieval. Answers are often short phrases. Need to handle generational titles correctly (e.g., "James Vernon the Younger"). Many questions center around entities like people, places, creative works, organizations (universities), and biological classifications (genus, species). The questions often directly ask *for the name of* these things. Examples: "Who was the first cardiologist in Kashmir?" "Who murdered the supervillain Monsieur Mallah?". Entity Recognition and Disambiguation are Key.
*   **Temporal Specificity:** Questions often require precise temporal information (month, year, range of years), with many questions requiring events within a specific year or even date (e.g., "February 27, 2022"). This is a key characteristic. Example from Iteration 11: "day, month, and year". The dataset is brittle with even small discrepancies leading to incorrect responses. Temporal Reasoning required. Questions frequently involve ordinal numbers (e.g., 21st) or specific years, which should be critical signals.
*   **Extraction of Specific Dates/Names From Historical Contexts:** The questions often require extracting specific dates or names from historical contexts ("month, day, and year of philosopher Edmund Burke's last day in office").
*   **"Which" Questions Targeting Specific Individuals/Entities with Constraints:** Several questions begin with "Which" and seek a specific individual or entity associated with a particular role or accomplishment, often including specific constraints related to entities, timeframes, or categories (e.g., "Which architect was tasked with finishing the chapel...?"). The constraints are crucial to identifying the correct answer.
*   **"Specific Instance" Questions:** The questions frequently ask for the specific instance of a general category ("Which *specific* ocean was the asteroid 224 Oceana named after?"). This requires high precision.
*   **Complex Noun Phrases:** The questions often include complex noun phrases that require accurate parsing and understanding (e.g., "Aomori University Men’s Rhythmic Gymnastics Team").
*   **Question Types:** Primarily fact-retrieval questions asking for specific details about people, places, or things ("Who...", "What...", "Name of...", "Which...").
*   **Need for Precise Factual Recall:** Questions require precise factual recall, often involving dates, numbers, or names (e.g., "Champions League semi-final match between Barcelona and Milan on April 27, 2006", "What month and year did Apple release the Hey Siri feature?"). Examples from Iteration 11: resolution in pixels, dates of events.
*   **Contextual Specificity:** Questions often contain specific contextual details to narrow the scope of the answer. The "Dragon Age" question requires understanding of character relationships and in-game possibilities. Complex event queries require integrating information from multiple sources (e.g., sports matches, product announcements). Questions, like the EEG sampling rate question, rely on specific contextual information such as research paper titles, authors, and publication years.
*   **Information Extraction Task:** The dataset tests the ability to extract *very specific* pieces of information from potentially larger contexts. It's not simply about broad topic understanding.
*   **Definitive Answers Expected:** The questions expect precise answers (specific dates, names), not general descriptions or related concepts.
*   **Complex Factual Questions:** The dataset contains complex factual questions that often require multi-hop reasoning or accessing multiple pieces of information. Questions often involve multiple entities or relationships (e.g., "the younger daughter of Mehbooba Mufti"). This requires the system to correctly identify and relate these elements to retrieve the final answer.
*   **Multi-part Answers Common:** Several questions require multi-part answers, such as specifying both the award and the category (e.g., "Which award and in which category..."). This necessitates the system to identify and extract multiple pieces of information that are linked together.
*   **Entity Specificity:** Many questions revolve around specific entities like people (e.g., "Anita Sandoval"), projects ("Project Firebreak"), awards ("ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award"), and products ("Horizon Zero Dawn"). The correctness depends heavily on identifying these entities accurately.
*   **Indirect Relationships:** Questions often involve indirect relationships. The answer isn't directly stated but needs to be inferred from the provided information.
*   **Complex Question Structure:** The questions are fact-retrieval based but require understanding relationships and potentially hierarchical information.
*   **Context Dependency:** The answers are not directly present in the question itself; they require accessing and processing external information (simulated knowledge base) and connecting it to the question terms.
*   **Assumed Prior Knowledge and Lack of Context:** The questions often assume background knowledge not explicitly stated in the question itself. For example, the IJCAI award question assumes the user knows what IJCAI stands for and the specific award being referenced (Iteration 15).
*   **Varied Answer Types:** The expected answers encompass different data types, including strings (names, academy titles) and numerical values (years), which necessitate a flexible validation approach.
*   **Multi-hop Reasoning:** The dataset features questions that often require **multi-hop reasoning** and synthesis of information from multiple sources.
*   **Broad Subject Matter:** The questions are varied in subject matter, ranging from history and geography to academia and linguistics, politics, zoology, and performing arts. This requires a broad knowledge base and adaptable information retrieval.
*   **Fact-Seeking and Precise Information:** The questions are fact-seeking, requiring precise information retrieval (dates, ages, publication details).
*   **Name Disambiguation:** Many questions revolve around specific individuals, requiring accurate identification and disambiguation (e.g., Satyanarayan Gangaram Pitroda). The system needs to differentiate between similar names. Questions involving people's names (spouse of Silas A. Holcomb) require disambiguation.
*   **Complex Attribute Retrieval:** The task involves retrieving specific attributes (e.g., award received, position held, professorship duration) associated with entities.
*   **Fact-based, Detail-Oriented Questions:** The questions require precise factual recall, often related to dates, names, or specific versions/patches. Even slight inaccuracies are penalized.
*   **Subject Matter Specificity:** The questions span diverse domains (history, video games, academia), requiring a broad base of knowledge or the ability to quickly acquire it. The "Terraria" example highlights the need for specialized knowledge. Example from Iteration 11: technical or specialized terminology.
*   **Implicit Context:** Some questions, like the Valiant example, require understanding implicit context or relationships. Simply extracting keywords is insufficient.
*   **Numerical Data:** The dataset contains fact-based questions requiring precise answers, often involving numerical data (e.g., resolution in pixels). Numerical Precision Matters.
*   **Niche Knowledge Domain:** The questions cover very specific areas (video game mechanics, advanced mathematics, historical events in specific fields).
*   **Complex Sentence Structure:** The questions can have complex sentence structures involving conditions, mathematical notation and specific terminology.
*   **Potential for Contradictory Information:** Search results might contain contradictory information (e.g., stating "no survivors" versus a specific name).
*   **Communist Party Emphasis (Iteration 22):** Several questions involve the Communist party, which might indicate a bias or specific focus within the dataset.
*   **Unit Awareness:** The questions explicitly specify the units required in the answer (e.g., meters). The system must not only find the correct numerical value but also ensure it is expressed in the correct unit.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Initial Attempts Ineffective:** The initial strategy of using an LLM for iterative refinement with a validation step resulted in 0% accuracy, indicating the need for significant improvements.
*   **Current Accuracy Very Low:** With a maximum accuracy of 0.67 (Iteration 22) no current strategies can be considered effectively "working" consistently. The underlying framework shows potential but requires significant refinement.
*   **RAG Framework Insufficient:** The initial hypothesis that a basic RAG framework with Gemini is sufficient for this task is rejected.
*   **Fact Verification Approach Needs Active Information Seeking**: The fact verification approach with multi-source integration shows promise, since it decomposes the problem into generating multiple search queries, simulating context retrieval from these queries while verifying their relevance, extracting answers from each context, synthesizing a final answer, and validating that final answer. However, this strategy needs an active information-seeking loop.
*   Decomposing the task into sub-tasks such as information extraction, search query generation, answer extraction, and validation seems like a reasonable approach and may provide a good starting point if further refined.
*   **Concept Expansion is Insufficient:** The approach's reliance on concept expansion alone isn't sufficient to guarantee accurate answer extraction (Experiment 10). While expanding concepts may broaden the search space, it doesn't ensure that the specific piece of information required by the question will be found and correctly extracted.
*   **NONE:** The accuracy in most experiments is 0.00, suggesting no part of the current strategy is effective. *There were no successful strategies demonstrated in Iteration 24.*
*   **Knowledge Base Selection (Iteration 12):** The knowledge base selection *seems* to be functioning reasonably well (but needs further validation).
*   **Decomposition Potential (Iteration 12):** Using LLMs to decompose the problem into KB selection, query generation, answer extraction, and fact verification shows potential as a framework.
*   **Decomposition Isn't Always Helpful (Iteration 15):** Decomposing the question into sub-questions without a robust mechanism for ensuring that the sub-questions are helpful and comprehensively answered can lead to failures. LLM confidence scores are not reliable.
*   **Structured decomposition, adaptive querying, and fact verification are insufficient** (Iteration 17)
*   **LLM-driven knowledge graph traversal alone is insufficient** for questions requiring anything beyond direct fact retrieval (Iteration 18).
*   **Question transformation and a verification loop in isolation are ineffective.** (Iteration 20)
*   **Simulated Search Diversity (Potentially):** The core idea of using multiple simulated search engines with different biases has the *potential* to be a strength. However, it's only effective if the simulated biases are truly diverse and relevant to the questions asked. We don't have enough information to confirm this worked well, but the concept is promising.

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Incorrect Entity Association:** The system retrieves information related to the correct event but attributes it to the wrong entity. Example: Identifying a different winner of the Eddington Medal (George W. Wetherill instead of Leon Mestel). The knowledge base retrieval must accurately resolve entities and differentiate between similar names or related events. Example from Iteration 21: extracting "Collin Roesler" instead of "Annick Bricaud" for the Jerlov Award question. Entity Confusion is a key failure mode. *In Iteration 24, the system retrieved *a* spouse's name but not the *correct* spouse's name (Martha Alice Brinson) for the Holcomb example.* The LLM hallucinates a plausible but incorrect answer.
*   **Inability to Extract Precise Information:** The system often fails to extract the *exact* piece of information required to answer the question. For example, when asked about the years of service, it returns a description of the service instead of the specific years (Iteration 19).
*   **Insufficient Answer Granularity:** The system often returns answers that are correct but lack the precision required. E.g., answering "2023" when the expected answer was "Sep 07, 2023." The LLM needs stronger guidance to prioritize granularity. Disregarding or misinterpreting temporal context leads to incorrect answers.
*   **Inability to Perform Temporal Reasoning:** The system fails when a question requires comparing or understanding dates. Example: The Edmund Burke question requires knowing the difference between August 1783 and 8 January 1784, implying reasoning about a timeframe.
*   **Lack of Granularity and Specificity:** The system provides overly general answers when specific details are needed. Example: The Oceana question where "the ocean" was returned instead of "Pacific Ocean." This suggests an issue in answer validation or knowledge graph granularity. The system isn't able to effectively differentiate between broader and more specific concepts. The system needs to prioritize exact numerical matches.
*   **Incorrect Granularity:** The system sometimes provides answers that are either too broad or too narrow. For example, when asked about the digits of forefeet, it includes an extra digit not specified in the ground truth (Iteration 19).
*   **Inference Limitations:** Questions requiring inference based on the knowledge graph structure consistently fail. The system can only look up directly stated facts and struggles with multi-hop reasoning or combining information.
*   **Overly Strict Validation:** The primary failure mode *was* the "Could not be validated" response. This *suggested* the validation logic *was* too rigid and relies too heavily on keyword matching, failing to account for semantic similarity or logical equivalence.
*   **Validation Sensitivity:** The primary failure *stemmed* from over-sensitive validation logic. The system *frequently reported* "Could not be validated" even when the answer *might* be present but not in the exact expected format. The validation mechanism *struggles* with answers that convey the same information in different ways. It *is limited* by it's ability to see that the system output and golden answer are linked. However, the more recent experiments show the *opposite* problem: Validation is INSUFFICIENT and often fails to catch incorrect answers.
*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding During Validation:** The validator likely struggles to relate the retrieved information to the specific constraints in the question. Contextual misinterpretation occurs in event queries.
*   **Dependency on Perfect Information Retrieval:** The system's reliance on simulated retrieval means a slightly off search query can lead to no relevant information, and thus, a validation failure even if the LLM could have reasoned with broader knowledge.
*   **Inability to resolve conflicting information.** The system needs a more robust method for selecting the correct answer when multiple possibilities are presented in the search context. Example: When the search result contains contradictory information (e.g., stating "no survivors" versus a specific name), the system *doesn't detect the contradiction* and may select the wrong information.
*   **Failure to identify the correct entity in search results.** The system struggles with identifying the correct entities when multiple entities might fit the search query. The system doesn't appear to be able to accurately resolve ambiguous search results.
*   **Poor Simulated Search Results:** The low accuracy reinforces the possibility that the simulated search results are not accurate or relevant enough, hindering both information extraction and validation.
*   **Inaccurate Entity Resolution:** The "James Vernon the Younger" example highlights the need to handle generational titles correctly.
*   **Knowledge Graph Misidentification/Hallucination:** The "ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award" example showcases a failure to retrieve the correct information from the knowledge source.
*   **Information Extraction Bottleneck:** The primary failure mode is the inability of the system to extract the correct answer from the provided context. The system struggles to translate expanded concepts into precise, factual answers. For example, it might understand that Santo Domingo is a settlement but fail to identify the specific founding year (1778) (Experiment 10).
*   **Insufficient Context Detection Failure:** The agent struggles when the initially retrieved context (simulated or otherwise) lacks the information required to answer the question. It fails to narrow down the search to the specific individual (Silas A. Holcomb, the ninth Governor of Nebraska) when retrieving information about his spouse.
*   **Passive Behavior Regarding Missing Information:** The system's most significant failure mode is its inability to actively address information gaps.
*   **Lack of Numerical Precision:** The James Vernon example demonstrates a failure in matching numerical answers.
*   **Insufficient validation leads to incorrect answers:** The validation process is overly trusting and fails to catch incorrect extractions.
*   **Inability to handle ambiguity and semantic equivalence.**
*   **Poor Query Generation:** The generated search queries consistently fail to retrieve the necessary information.
*   **Incorrect Entity Attribution:** The system incorrectly attributes information to the wrong entity. This highlights a failure in entity recognition and linking.
*   **Temporal Reasoning Errors:** The system struggles with temporal reasoning, such as determining the start and end years of a professorship.
*   **Inability to Handle Partial Information:** Even when the system extracts *some* relevant information, it fails if it cannot find *all* the required pieces.
*   **Ineffective Search Query Formulation:** The core failure stems from the inability to generate search queries that retrieve relevant information.
*   **Lack of Domain Specificity in Search:** The search queries appear to lack the domain-specific nuance required.
*   **Failure to Handle Implicit Context:** The Valiant example in Experiment 9 illustrates that the search strategy cannot infer the necessary contextual information to formulate an effective search query.
*   **Answer Extraction Failure:** A common failure is returning "No Answer" even when related concepts are identified. This points to a weakness in the answer extraction stage.
*   **Lack of Information Retrieval Linkage:** Even when expanded concepts are relevant, the system fails to connect them to the information needed to answer the question.
*   **Incorrect Precision:** The system struggles with providing answers that match the precise detail required by the dataset (e.g., resolution in pixels) (Iteration 11).
*   **Inability to Extract Specific Temporal Data:** The system failed to extract the exact date of the Hubble Telescope incident, instead providing general information about anomalies. This often happens if the context is murky or if multiple dates are present (Iteration 11).
*   **Insufficient Fact Verification:** The system doesn't effectively cross-reference information from multiple sources to validate the accuracy of its answers (Iteration 11).
*   **Inability to extract exact dates/years (Iteration 12):** The primary failure is the inability to pinpoint the specific year or date from the simulated search results. The LLM often provides a range or an approximation (e.g., "likely 2005 or later") instead of the exact answer.
*   **Insufficient precision in information extraction (Iteration 12):** Even when relevant information is present in the "retrieved" text, the system fails to extract the specific answer.
*   **Reliance on Simulated Results (Iteration 12):** Since the search results are simulated, any errors in the simulation are passed down the chain.
*   **Incorrect Fact Retrieval and Ranking (Iteration 13):** LLM retrieves/ranks incorrect facts. Information retrieval and fact prioritization need improvement.
*   **Inability to Find Relevant Facts (Iteration 13):** LLM fails to find the correct answer, indicating limitations in search strategy or knowledge base.
*   **Synthesis of Incorrect Information (Iteration 13):** The synthesis stage does not correct misinformation provided in the extracted facts.
*   **Lack of Robust Verification (Iteration 13):** Fact verification fails, as incorrect answers are confidently presented.
*   **Contextual Misdirection (Location) (Iteration 14):** The system incorrectly identified "Winterthur" as the location. The system needs improved filtering of relevant vs. irrelevant location information.
*   **Numerical Extraction Failure (Version Number) (Iteration 14):** The system failed to extract the version number "1.1" related to the Terraria patch.
*   **General Numerical Extraction (Iteration 14):** The system demonstrates a weakness in reliably extracting specific numerical values from text.
*   **Unit Conversion and Precision (Iteration 15):** The system failed to provide the correct wingspan for *Eugnosta misella* because it either retrieved the wrong information or failed to convert the units correctly.
*   **Incomplete Sub-question Answering (Iteration 15):** The system failed to answer the IJCAI award question because the LLM agent was unable to provide the sub-questions with adequate information to retrieve the answer.
*   **Inability to Disambiguate Related but Incorrect Information:** The "Avatar" question demonstrates the system's failure to differentiate between related but incorrect information.
*   **Insufficient Error Handling when Search Fails:** In the "college" question, when the search fails to return the correct answer, the system defaults to "I cannot answer the question."
*   **Failure to Retrieve Precise Numerical Data:** The system struggles to accurately retrieve and report numerical values. Numerical Tolerance is needed.
*   **Insufficient Information Retrieval for Niche Topics:** The system fails when questions require information from specialized or less readily available sources.
*   **Inability to Verify Semantic Equivalence with Numerical Values:** The "explanation" field in the failed examples indicates a specific problem with semantic equivalence in the context of numerical values.
*   **"No Answer" Response:** The system sometimes defaults to "No answer" even when a correct answer exists within its knowledge base (or could be found). This indicates an issue with confidence or a failure to properly search and retrieve relevant information (Iteration 19).
*   **Numerical Discrepancy Failure (Iteration 22):** Providing incorrect numerical answers when the correct answer is a specific year (e.g., answering "1996" when the correct answer is "1994").
*   **Lack of Verifiable Source (Iteration 22):** The system relies on the LLM's generated search results which are simulated. The LLM doesn't check against any authoritative source, and trusts it's own synthetic output.
*   **Lack of Disambiguation:** The system doesn't adequately differentiate between similar entities or contexts.

    *   **Strategy:** chain-of-thought approach, with expert agents and confidence scoring
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy
    *   **Finding:** Hypothesis Rejected: The hypothesis that a chain-of-thought approach, with expert agents and confidence scoring, would lead to accurate question answering on this dataset was rejected.
*   **Experiment 9:**
    *   **Strategy:** Transforming the original question into sub-questions, each targeting a specific piece of information required for the final answer.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** Question transformation alone is insufficient if the search queries generated are inadequate.
*   **Experiment 10:**
    *   **Strategy:** Expand Concepts for Information Retrieval. Implemented concept expansion to broaden the search space and improve recall.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The approach's reliance on concept expansion alone isn't sufficient to guarantee accurate answer extraction.
*   **Experiment 11:**
    *   **Strategy:** Multi-agent approach, similar to previous experiments, focused on query generation, information retrieval, answer extraction, and validation.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The multi-agent approach, as implemented, is insufficient for accurately answering complex, fact-based questions requiring precise information and temporal awareness. Simulated search is not sufficient for this task.
*   **Experiment 12:**
    *   **Strategy:** Exploration strategy, relying on LLM-based decomposition and targeted retrieval with the *existing* prompt engineering.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.

    *   **Strategy:** Question decomposition into sub-questions, followed by LLM fact extraction, synthesis, and verification.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** Question decomposition alone is insufficient. LLM fact retrieval fails, leading to incorrect syntheses and highlighting the need for external verification and robust fact retrieval mechanisms.
*   **Experiment 14:**
    *   **Strategy:** Iterative context expansion
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy
    *   **Finding:** Iterative context expansion alone does not guarantee accurate answers. The system struggles to filter relevant context and extract precise answers, particularly numerical ones. The current validation method is ineffective.
*   **Experiment 15:**
    *   **Strategy:** Question Decomposition with Sub-question Validation. Explored the effectiveness of decomposing the original question into sub-questions, but with an added focus on validating the relevance and informativeness of the generated sub-questions before proceeding to answer extraction.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy
    *   **Finding:** The experiment suggests that simply decomposing the question into sub-questions without a robust mechanism for ensuring that the sub-questions are helpful and comprehensively answered can lead to failures. The overhead of managing sub-questions might outweigh the benefits.
*   **Experiment 16:**
    *   **Strategy:** Sequential chain-of-thought with specific agent roles.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis that a sequential chain-of-thought approach with specific agent roles would provide acceptable accuracy in this dataset has been rejected, given the 0.00 accuracy score. Current LLM interaction is inadequate to produce correct answers.
*   **Experiment 17:**
    *   **Strategy:** Structured decomposition, adaptive querying, and fact verification.
    *   **Result:** 0.33 accuracy
    *   **Finding:** Structured decomposition, adaptive querying, and fact verification was not supported by the results. The system needs a far more effective and reliable mechanism for external information retrieval and integration to handle these questions.
*   **Experiment 18:**
    *   **Strategy:** Simplified in-memory knowledge graph construction and LLM-guided traversal.
    *   **Result:** 0.33 accuracy
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that constructing a simplified in-memory knowledge graph and traversing it with LLM guidance will improve accuracy is rejected.

*   **Experiment 19:**
    *   **Strategy:** Iterative Question Expansion & Dual Verification
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that iteratively expanding the question and using dual verification would improve accuracy was rejected. The results suggest that the current implementation of these techniques is not effective for this dataset, potentially due to the complexity of the questions and the need for precise information retrieval.
*   **Experiment 20:**
    *   **Strategy:** Question transformation and verification loop.
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis was that question transformation and a verification loop would improve accuracy. The implemented approach, in its current form, is ineffective for this dataset.
*   **Experiment 21:**
    *   **Strategy:** RAG approach with information extraction, search simulation, answer extraction, and validation components.
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The hypothesis that the current RAG approach could accurately answer fact-retrieval questions from this dataset was rejected. Answer validation is a critical weakness.
*   **Experiment 22:**
    *   **Strategy:** Multiple simulated search engines with answer reconciliation.
    *   **Result:** 0.67 accuracy
    *   **Finding:** Fact retrieval is a significant bottleneck. Even with reconciliation, relying on simulated search results introduces errors. Reconciliation alone is insufficient without reliable initial fact retrieval.
*   **Experiment 23:**
    *   **Strategy:** Multiple simulated search engines with answer reconciliation.
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy
    *   **Finding:** The experiment strongly suggests that simply simulating multiple search engines and reconciling their answers is insufficient for achieving high accuracy on this dataset.
*   **Experiment 24:**
    *   **Strategy:** Hierarchical Validation of KB1 vs KB2
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy
    *   **Finding:** A simple QA pipeline involving retrieval, extraction, and validation, even with prioritized knowledge bases, struggles with complex factual recall questions requiring disambiguation and contextual understanding. Hierarchical Validation is Ineffective if Initial Fact Retrieval is poor.
*   **Script Repair Errors:**
    *   Multiple errors during script repair attempts highlight issues with validation logic, missing attributes, index errors, and module configurations. (See original document for full list).

## 5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

*   **Implement Entity Disambiguation (CRITICAL):** Integrate an entity disambiguation module into the retrieval process. This module should identify the specific entity being queried (e.g., Silas A. Holcomb, the ninth Governor of Nebraska, as opposed to any Silas A. Holcomb) and filter the knowledge base results accordingly. Techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and linking to a knowledge graph (if available) could be helpful.
*   **Implement External Validation (CRITICAL):** Augment the `validate_answer` function to compare the LLM's answer with a reliable external knowledge base (e.g., Wikidata, a fact-checked database) to verify its accuracy *after* reconciliation. This is crucial for addressing the lack of verifiable sources.
*   **Improve Search Simulation Fidelity:** Enhance the `simulate_search` function to generate more realistic and diverse search results. This could involve techniques like:
    *   Providing the LLM with a list of real-world sources it should mimic or "cite."
    *   Using a different LLM specifically trained on generating realistic search snippets.
*   **Focus on Numerical Answer Accuracy:** Implement specific error handling for questions requiring numerical answers. If the reconciled answer is a number, add a step to double-check its validity against a range of possible values or known dates related to the question's topic. **The high error rate with year-based answers (Iteration 22) requires immediate attention.** Implement a tolerance range (e.g., accept answers within +/- 5% of the expected value if an exact match isn't found, *after* confirming it against multi-sources). Implement basic reasonableness checks (e.g., the depth of a lake cannot be negative).
*   **Address Communist Party Dataset Focus:** Account for the dataset's communist party emphasis by increasing the relevance of that specific information when simulating searches or looking for answer reconciliation, for instance by incorporating additional information or biases into the simulated search engines to better reflect the type of sources most likely to have information on this topic.
*   **Strengthen Answer Validation:** Implement more robust checks. Focus on name matching using string similarity metrics (e.g., Levenshtein distance) to detect minor variations or possible misspellings. Ensure the extracted name is actually associated with relevant context (award and year, if applicable).The validation step should involve querying multiple reliable sources (e.g., Wikipedia, specialized databases) to confirm the answer's accuracy.
*   **Improve Search Result Assessment:** Implement a step to assess the "quality" or "relevance" of the simulated search results *before* extracting the answer. If the results seem contradictory or low quality, trigger a re-query or flag the question for human review.
*   **Enhanced Information Extraction:** Improve the `extract_information` function to accurately identify entities and constraints from the question. Pay special attention to ordinal numbers, years, and potential name variations. Consider incorporating external knowledge bases or APIs (if permitted) to help resolve name ambiguities or verify facts.
*   **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Incorporate mechanisms to understand and leverage contextual cues within the questions. For the EEG question, focus on extracting and utilizing the paper title, authors, and year. This could involve using a separate LLM call to summarize the context or using more sophisticated embedding techniques that capture relationships between the question components.
*   **Enhance Temporal Reasoning:** Implement a mechanism for explicitly encoding and reasoning about temporal information. This could involve adding temporal constraints to the transformed query or using a dedicated temporal reasoning module.
*   **Improve Entity Linking:** Use a more robust entity linking system to accurately resolve and disambiguate entities mentioned in the question. This could involve incorporating a pre-trained entity linking model or improving the entity linking prompts. Add examples to the prompts that provide context for the entities.
*   **Improve Knowledge Base Simulation:** If possible, improve the fidelity of the simulated knowledge bases. Ensure they contain accurate information, including common incorrect associations or confusing data points. This will create a more realistic testing environment and better reveal the system's weaknesses. Specifically include negative examples, or information that will allow the system to better determine which information is *not* associated with the entity or context.
*   **Refine Verification Prompts:** The verification prompts need to be far more precise and explicitly check for temporal accuracy, correct entity association, and contextual relevance. The prompts should specifically instruct the LLM to compare and contrast the retrieved information with the original question's context. Consider providing examples of what constitutes a "semantically equivalent" vs. "incorrect" answer.
*   **Consider Reranking Answers:** If the knowledge base retrieves multiple potentially relevant answers, implement a re-ranking mechanism that prioritizes answers based on a confidence score that considers factors such as temporal proximity, entity match accuracy, and contextual relevance.
*   **Fine-tune for Granularity:** If possible, fine-tune the LLM on examples that emphasize the importance of answer granularity, rewarding responses that provide the most specific and detailed information.
*   **Fine-tune LLM for Fact Retrieval:** Consider fine-tuning the LLM specifically for fact retrieval tasks, using a dataset of questions and answers related to the target domain. This could improve the LLM's ability to accurately identify and extract relevant information from the knowledge bases.
*   **Implement a Unit Verification and Conversion Module (Iteration 15):** A post-processing step should be added to verify and convert units, ensuring the final answer is in the requested unit. Implement stricter unit handling to ensure the answer is expressed in the correct units.
*   **Refine Answer Formulation:** Constrain Answer Format (prompt engineering or post-processing). Improve Semantic Similarity Evaluation.
*   **Address "No Answer" Responses:** Implement a Confidence Threshold. Improve Search and Retrieval (Consider RAG with a vector database from a high-quality KB).
*   **Increase Few-Shot Examples:** Provide more few-shot examples to better guide the LLM to

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

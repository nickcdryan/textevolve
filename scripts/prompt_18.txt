            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
            

            Here are example problems from previously seen data:

        PRIMARY ISSUES (last 3 iterations):
        [
  {
    "iteration": 8,
    "issue": "The primary issue is **inconsistent fact verification** paired with weaknesses in **temporal reasoning**. The system extracts and presents information without adequately checking its accuracy or internal consistency, especially when dealing with temporal data."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 9,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the **system's inability to formulate and execute effective search queries that reliably retrieve the necessary information to answer complex questions.** This failure cascades through the subsequent reasoning steps, rendering the system unable to provide accurate answers."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 10,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's inability to effectively link expanded concepts with concrete information from a knowledge source and extract the specific answer required by the question. The system gets stuck in a conceptual understanding phase without effectively extracting the precise answer."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 11,
    "issue": "The primary issue is **inadequate fact verification and source reliability assessment.** The system extracts information without effectively verifying its accuracy across multiple sources and weighing the credibility of those sources."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 12,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the **lack of a robust mechanism for precise information extraction from the retrieved (simulated) search results.** The system can identify relevant information sources, but it cannot consistently extract the specific answer."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 13,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the **inaccurate retrieval and ranking of relevant facts, coupled with a lack of robust fact verification, leading to the propagation of misinformation and confident, yet incorrect, answers.**"
  },
  {
    "iteration": 14,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's susceptibility to contextual misdirection, combined with a weak ability to extract specific numerical answers. It fails to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant contextual details, and its extraction process for numerical values is unreliable, leading to the \"Could not be validated\" error."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 15,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the system's inability to accurately retrieve and synthesize factual knowledge from external sources and integrate it effectively through reasoning over generated sub-questions to produce a precise final answer. It also has issues with generating sensible prompts for the sub-questions."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 16,
    "issue": "The primary issue is a **deficient answer validation mechanism**. The current validation process seems to rely on superficial matching or lacks the capacity to deeply analyze the extracted answer in relation to the original question and constraints. This leads to false positives, where incorrect answers are deemed correct, preventing the system from engaging in error correction or further refinement."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 17,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's **reliance on internal knowledge and its lack of a robust mechanism for information retrieval and integration from external sources**. This is compounded by the system's limited capability to handle numerical values and semantic equivalence accurately."
  }
]

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Use a combination of keyword matching, semantic similarity analysis, and rule-based reasoning to assess the validity of the extracted answer.",
  "Employ techniques such as abductive reasoning to infer missing information based on the constraints.",
  "Develop a mechanism to rank search results based on their relevance to the question and constraints.",
  "Consider using a more structured knowledge representation (e.g., a knowledge graph) to store and reason about the information extracted from the search results.",
  "Use a separate module specifically for dealing with game version numbers and how updates apply to items/crafting recipes.",
  "Utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques to identify key entities and their relationships in the search results.",
  "Specifically, when a negative constraint is present, verify that the extracted answer explicitly excludes the specified entity/concept.",
  "Implement a confidence scoring system that reflects the degree of certainty in the answer's correctness. Lower confidence should trigger further investigation or search attempts.",
  "Use these rules to filter and validate potential answers.",
  "Explicitly represent constraints as logical rules or predicates."

    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"], 
                constraints_result["constraints"]
            )
            if not solution_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Solution generation failed: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in solution generation: {solution_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 17 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script answers factual questions using structured decomposition, adaptive querying, and fact verification, leveraging the Gemini LLM. The problem is decomposed into identifying entities, attributes, and constraints. The agent roles include an expert in question decomposition, adaptive query generation, information retrieval, concise answer extraction and a strict fact verifier. The overall workflow involves `call_llm` being used with different system instructions to decompose the question, generate search queries, retrieve information, extract an answer, and verify the answer's validity against the original question. `main` orchestrates these steps, returning the answer if validated or indicating failure.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 16 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script implements a question-answering system using the Gemini LLM and a series of agent roles to decompose the problem. It uses chain-of-thought prompting by sequentially extracting information, generating a search query, retrieving information, extracting the answer, and validating it. The agent roles include information extractor, search query generator, search engine, answer extraction expert, and answer validator.

The functions used are `call_llm` (interacts with the LLM), `extract_information` (extracts entities and constraints), `generate_search_query` (creates search query), `extract_answer` (extracts answer from search results), `validate_answer` (validates the answer). The `main` function orchestrates the process by calling these functions in sequence to answer a given question. The overall workflow involves processing the question through these stages to arrive at a validated answer.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 15 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script uses LLMs to answer questions by decomposing them into multiple sub-questions, extracting answers with confidence scores, and aggregating those answers. It employs a "Multi-faceted Question Decomposition and Answer Aggregation with Confidence Scoring" approach. The script uses the `call_llm` function to generate sub-questions, extract answers, synthesize a final answer, and verify the answer, each time providing a distinct system instruction to give the LLM a specific agent role (question decomposer, answer extractor, information synthesizer, answer accuracy validator). The workflow starts by decomposing the original question, extracting the answers to the sub-questions, aggregating these answers, and finally validating the final answer.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 14 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script uses an iterative context expansion and answer ranking approach to answer questions. It decomposes the problem into contextualization, iterative expansion/extraction, answer ranking, and validation steps, leveraging the LLM in different roles such as context provider, question expander/answer extractor, answer ranker, and validator. The functions used are `call_llm` for LLM interaction and `main` to orchestrate the answering process, with `main` calling `call_llm` multiple times to refine the context and evaluate potential answers. The overall workflow involves initially contextualizing the question, iteratively expanding on that context to extract potential answers, ranking these answers based on the original question and expanded context, and finally validating the top-ranked answer.

The function `call_llm` is used to interface with the Gemini LLM. `main` first decomposes the initial question by calling `call_llm`, then extracts candidate facts by calling `call_llm`, synthesizes an answer by calling `call_llm`, and finally verifies the answer by calling `call_llm`.

            LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, here's the updated and synthesized version of our learnings, focusing specifically on the given dataset and task. This document will serve as our evolving research log.

## 1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS

*   **Factual and Specific Questions:** Questions are factual and seek specific pieces of information across a wide range of topics.
*   **Emphasis on Proper Nouns and Named Entities:** Questions frequently contain proper nouns and specific dates, making them amenable to information retrieval. Answers are often short phrases, often consisting of one or a few proper nouns (names of people or things). Examples: "Who was the first cardiologist in Kashmir?" "Who murdered the supervillain Monsieur Mallah?". Need to handle generational titles correctly (e.g., "James Vernon the Younger"). Many questions center around named entities like people, places, or creative works.
*   **Explicit Named Entities:** Questions frequently focus on named entities like people, organizations (universities), and biological classifications (genus, species). The questions directly ask *for the name of* these things.
*   **Specific Year Requirements:** The dataset frequently requires identifying a specific year associated with an event or person (e.g., "In what year did Etta Cone last visit Europe?"). This suggests a strong reliance on temporal reasoning and access to date-related information.
*   **Temporal Specificity:** Questions often require precise temporal information (month, year, range of years). This is a key characteristic. Example from Iteration 11: "day, month, and year".
*   **"Which" Questions Targeting Specific Individuals/Entities with Constraints:** Several questions begin with "Which" and seek a specific individual or entity associated with a particular role or accomplishment, often including specific constraints related to entities, timeframes, or categories (e.g., "Which architect was tasked with finishing the chapel...?"). The constraints are crucial to identifying the correct answer.
*   **Question Types:** Primarily fact-retrieval questions asking for specific details about people, places, or things ("Who...", "What...", "Name of...", "Which...").
*   **Need for Precise Factual Recall:** Questions require precise factual recall, often involving dates, numbers, or names (e.g., "Champions League semi-final match between Barcelona and Milan on April 27, 2006", "What month and year did Apple release the Hey Siri feature?"). Examples from Iteration 11: resolution in pixels, dates of events.
*   **Contextual Specificity:** Questions often contain specific contextual details to narrow the scope of the answer. The "Dragon Age" question requires understanding of character relationships and in-game possibilities.
*   **Information Extraction Task:** The dataset tests the ability to extract *very specific* pieces of information from potentially larger contexts. It's not simply about broad topic understanding.
*   **"Who" questions requiring specific names:** Many questions (e.g., "Who was the first cardiologist in Kashmir?") require identifying specific individuals, making accurate name retrieval crucial. A significant portion of questions targets **specific names, titles, or locations.** The answers often involve precise string matching.
*   **Questions requiring temporal context:** Some questions involve temporal qualifiers. This demands understanding of historical or fictional timelines to extract correct information.
*   **Questions expecting definitive answers:** The questions expect precise answers (specific dates, names), not general descriptions or related concepts.
*   **Complex Factual Questions:** The dataset contains complex factual questions that often require multi-hop reasoning or accessing multiple pieces of information. Questions often involve multiple entities or relationships (e.g., "the younger daughter of Mehbooba Mufti"). This requires the system to correctly identify and relate these elements to retrieve the final answer.
*   **Multi-part Answers Common:** Several questions require multi-part answers, such as specifying both the award and the category (e.g., "Which award and in which category..."). This necessitates the system to identify and extract multiple pieces of information that are linked together.
*   **Entity Specificity:** Many questions revolve around specific entities like people (e.g., "Anita Sandoval"), projects ("Project Firebreak"), awards ("ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award"), and products ("Horizon Zero Dawn"). The correctness depends heavily on identifying these entities accurately.
*   **Temporal Reasoning:** Some questions require temporal reasoning, understanding dates, and relating events to specific time periods.
*   **Complex Question Structure:** The questions are fact-retrieval based but require understanding relationships and potentially hierarchical information.
*   **Context Dependency:** The answers are not directly present in the question itself; they require accessing and processing external information (simulated knowledge base) and connecting it to the question terms.
*   **Assumed Prior Knowledge and Lack of Context:** The questions often assume background knowledge not explicitly stated in the question itself. For example, the IJCAI award question assumes the user knows what IJCAI stands for and the specific award being referenced (Iteration 15).
*   **Varied Answer Types:** The expected answers encompass different data types, including strings (names, academy titles) and numerical values (years), which necessitate a flexible validation approach.
*   **Multi-hop Reasoning:** The dataset features questions that often require **multi-hop reasoning** and synthesis of information from multiple sources.
*   **Broad Subject Matter:** The questions are varied in subject matter, ranging from history and geography to academia and linguistics. This requires a broad knowledge base and adaptable information retrieval.
*   **Fact-Seeking and Precise Information:** The questions are fact-seeking, requiring precise information retrieval (dates, ages, publication details).
*   **Name Disambiguation:** Many questions revolve around specific individuals, requiring accurate identification and disambiguation (e.g., Satyanarayan Gangaram Pitroda). The system needs to differentiate between similar names.
*   **Complex Attribute Retrieval:** The task involves retrieving specific attributes (e.g., award received, position held, professorship duration) associated with entities.
*   **Fact-based, Detail-Oriented Questions:** The questions require precise factual recall, often related to dates, names, or specific versions/patches. Even slight inaccuracies are penalized.
*   **Subject Matter Specificity:** The questions span diverse domains (history, video games, academia), requiring a broad base of knowledge or the ability to quickly acquire it. The "Terraria" example highlights the need for specialized knowledge. Example from Iteration 11: technical or specialized terminology.
*   **Implicit Context:** Some questions, like the Valiant example, require understanding implicit context or relationships. Simply extracting keywords is insufficient.
*   **Numerical Data:** The dataset contains fact-based questions requiring precise answers, often involving numerical data (e.g., resolution in pixels).
*    **Niche Knowledge Domain:** The questions cover very specific areas (video game mechanics, advanced mathematics, historical events in specific fields).
*   **Complex Sentence Structure:** The questions can have complex sentence structures involving conditions, mathematical notation and specific terminology.

## 2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

*   **Initial Attempts Ineffective:** The initial strategy of using an LLM for iterative refinement with a validation step resulted in 0% accuracy, indicating the need for significant improvements.
*   **Current Accuracy Very Low:** With an accuracy of 0.33 in experiment 1 and experiment 4 and 0.00 in experiments 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 & 17, no current strategies can be considered effectively "working". The underlying framework shows potential but requires significant refinement. The highest accuracy has been 0.33 (Experiment 1 and Experiment 4).
*   **RAG Framework Insufficient:** The initial hypothesis that a basic RAG framework with Gemini is sufficient for this task is rejected.
*   **Fact Verification Approach Needs Active Information Seeking**: The fact verification approach with multi-source integration shows promise, since it decomposes the problem into generating multiple search queries, simulating context retrieval from these queries while verifying their relevance, extracting answers from each context, synthesizing a final answer, and validating that final answer. However, this strategy needs an active information-seeking loop.
*   Decomposing the task into sub-tasks such as information extraction, search query generation, answer extraction, and validation seems like a reasonable approach and may provide a good starting point if further refined.
*   **Concept Expansion is Insufficient:** The approach's reliance on concept expansion alone isn't sufficient to guarantee accurate answer extraction (Experiment 10). While expanding concepts may broaden the search space, it doesn't ensure that the specific piece of information required by the question will be found and correctly extracted.
*   **NONE:** The accuracy in Experiment 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 & 17 is 0.00, suggesting no part of the current strategy is effective.
*   **Knowledge Base Selection (Iteration 12):** The knowledge base selection seems to be functioning reasonably well.
*   **Decomposition Potential (Iteration 12):** Using LLMs to decompose the problem into KB selection, query generation, answer extraction, and fact verification shows potential as a framework.
*   **Decomposition Isn't Always Helpful (Iteration 15):** Decomposing the question into sub-questions without a robust mechanism for ensuring that the sub-questions are helpful and comprehensively answered can lead to failures. LLM confidence scores are not reliable.
*   **Structured decomposition, adaptive querying, and fact verification are insufficient** (Iteration 17)

## 3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET

*   **Overly Strict Validation:** The primary failure mode is the "Could not be validated" response. This suggests the validation logic is too rigid and relies too heavily on keyword matching, failing to account for semantic similarity or logical equivalence.
*   **Validation Sensitivity:** The primary failure stems from over-sensitive validation logic. The system frequently reports "Could not be validated" even when the answer *might* be present but not in the exact expected format. The validation mechanism struggles with answers that convey the same information in different ways. It is limited by it's ability to see that the system output and golden answer are linked.
*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding During Validation:** The validator likely struggles to relate the retrieved information to the specific constraints in the question.
*   **Dependency on Perfect Information Retrieval:** The system's reliance on simulated retrieval means a slightly off search query can lead to no relevant information, and thus, a validation failure even if the LLM could have reasoned with broader knowledge.
*   **Inability to resolve conflicting information.** The system needs a more robust method for selecting the correct answer when multiple possibilities are presented in the search context.
*   **Failure to identify the correct entity in search results.**
*   **Poor Simulated Search Results:** The low accuracy reinforces the possibility that the simulated search results are not accurate or relevant enough, hindering both information extraction and validation.
*   **Inaccurate Entity Resolution:** The "James Vernon the Younger" example highlights the need to handle generational titles correctly.
*   **Knowledge Graph Misidentification/Hallucination:** The "ISCB Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award" example showcases a failure to retrieve the correct information from the knowledge source.
*   **Information Extraction Bottleneck:** The primary failure mode is the inability of the system to extract the correct answer from the provided context. The system struggles to translate expanded concepts into precise, factual answers. For example, it might understand that Santo Domingo is a settlement but fail to identify the specific founding year (1778) (Experiment 10).
*   **Insufficient Context Detection Failure:** The agent struggles when the initially retrieved context (simulated or otherwise) lacks the information required to answer the question.
*   **Passive Behavior Regarding Missing Information:** The system's most significant failure mode is its inability to actively address information gaps.
*   **Lack of Numerical Precision:** The James Vernon example demonstrates a failure in matching numerical answers.
*   **Insufficient validation leads to incorrect answers:** As the primary identified issue is a lack of a robust validation mechanism.
*   **Inability to handle ambiguity and semantic equivalence.**
*   **Poor Query Generation:** The generated search queries consistently fail to retrieve the necessary information.
*   **Incorrect Entity Attribution:** The system incorrectly attributes information to the wrong entity. This highlights a failure in entity recognition and linking.
*   **Temporal Reasoning Errors:** The system struggles with temporal reasoning, such as determining the start and end years of a professorship.
*   **Inability to Handle Partial Information:** Even when the system extracts *some* relevant information, it fails if it cannot find *all* the required pieces.
*   **Ineffective Search Query Formulation:** The core failure stems from the inability to generate search queries that retrieve relevant information.
*   **Lack of Domain Specificity in Search:** The search queries appear to lack the domain-specific nuance required.
*   **Failure to Handle Implicit Context:** The Valiant example in Experiment 9 illustrates that the search strategy cannot infer the necessary contextual information to formulate an effective search query.
*   **Answer Extraction Failure:** A common failure is returning "No Answer" even when related concepts are identified. This points to a weakness in the answer extraction stage.
*   **Lack of Information Retrieval Linkage:** Even when expanded concepts are relevant, the system fails to connect them to the information needed to answer the question.
*   **Incorrect Precision:** The system struggles with providing answers that match the precise detail required by the dataset (e.g., resolution in pixels) (Iteration 11).
*   **Inability to Extract Specific Temporal Data:** The system failed to extract the exact date of the Hubble Telescope incident, instead providing general information about anomalies. This often happens if the context is murky or if multiple dates are present (Iteration 11).
*   **Insufficient Fact Verification:** The system doesn't effectively cross-reference information from multiple sources to validate the accuracy of its answers (Iteration 11).
*   **Inability to extract exact dates/years (Iteration 12):** The primary failure is the inability to pinpoint the specific year or date from the simulated search results. The LLM often provides a range or an approximation (e.g., "likely 2005 or later") instead of the exact answer.
*   **Insufficient precision in information extraction (Iteration 12):** Even when relevant information is present in the "retrieved" text, the system fails to extract the specific answer.
*   **Reliance on Simulated Results (Iteration 12):** Since the search results are simulated, any errors in the simulation are passed down the chain.
*   **Incorrect Fact Retrieval and Ranking (Iteration 13):** LLM retrieves/ranks incorrect facts. Information retrieval and fact prioritization need improvement.
*   **Inability to Find Relevant Facts (Iteration 13):** LLM fails to find the correct answer, indicating limitations in search strategy or knowledge base.
*   **Synthesis of Incorrect Information (Iteration 13):** The synthesis stage does not correct misinformation provided in the extracted facts.
*   **Lack of Robust Verification (Iteration 13):** Fact verification fails, as incorrect answers are confidently presented.
*   **Contextual Misdirection (Location) (Iteration 14):** The system incorrectly identified "Winterthur" as the location. The system needs improved filtering of relevant vs. irrelevant location information.
*   **Numerical Extraction Failure (Version Number) (Iteration 14):** The system failed to extract the version number "1.1" related to the Terraria patch.
*   **General Numerical Extraction (Iteration 14):** The system demonstrates a weakness in reliably extracting specific numerical values from text.
*   **Unit Conversion and Precision (Iteration 15):** The system failed to provide the correct wingspan for *Eugnosta misella* because it either retrieved the wrong information or failed to convert the units correctly.
*   **Incomplete Sub-question Answering (Iteration 15):** The system failed to answer the IJCAI award question because the LLM agent was unable to provide the sub-questions with adequate information to retrieve the answer.
*   **Inability to Disambiguate Related but Incorrect Information:** The "Avatar" question demonstrates the system's failure to differentiate between related but incorrect information.
*   **Insufficient Error Handling when Search Fails:** In the "college" question, when the search fails to return the correct answer, the system defaults to "I cannot answer the question."
*   **Failure to Retrieve Precise Numerical Data:** The system struggles to accurately retrieve and report numerical values.
*   **Insufficient Information Retrieval for Niche Topics:** The system fails when questions require information from specialized or less readily available sources.
*   **Inability to Verify Semantic Equivalence with Numerical Values:** The "explanation" field in the failed examples indicates a specific problem with semantic equivalence in the context of numerical values.

*   **Experiment 8:**
    *   **Strategy:** chain-of-thought approach, with expert agents and confidence scoring
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy
    *   **Finding:** Hypothesis Rejected: The hypothesis that a chain-of-thought approach, with expert agents and confidence scoring, would lead to accurate question answering on this dataset was rejected.
*   **Experiment 9:**
    *   **Strategy:** Transforming the original question into sub-questions, each targeting a specific piece of information required for the final answer.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** Question transformation alone is insufficient if the search queries generated are inadequate.
*   **Experiment 10:**
    *   **Strategy:** Expand Concepts for Information Retrieval. Implemented concept expansion to broaden the search space and improve recall.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The approach's reliance on concept expansion alone isn't sufficient to guarantee accurate answer extraction.
*   **Experiment 11:**
    *   **Strategy:** Multi-agent approach, similar to previous experiments, focused on query generation, information retrieval, answer extraction, and validation.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The multi-agent approach, as implemented, is insufficient for accurately answering complex, fact-based questions requiring precise information and temporal awareness. Simulated search is not sufficient for this task.
*   **Experiment 12:**
    *   **Strategy:** Exploration strategy, relying on LLM-based decomposition and targeted retrieval with the *existing* prompt engineering.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.

    *   **Strategy:** Question decomposition into sub-questions, followed by LLM fact extraction, synthesis, and verification.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** Question decomposition alone is insufficient. LLM fact retrieval fails, leading to incorrect syntheses and highlighting the need for external verification and robust fact retrieval mechanisms.
*   **Experiment 14:**
    *   **Strategy:** Iterative context expansion
    *   **Result:** 0.00 accuracy
    *   **Finding:** Iterative context expansion alone does not guarantee accurate answers. The system struggles to filter relevant context and extract precise answers, particularly numerical ones. The current validation method is ineffective.
*   **Experiment 15:**
    *   **Strategy:** Question Decomposition with Sub-question Validation. Explored the effectiveness of decomposing the original question into sub-questions, but with an added focus on validating the relevance and informativeness of the generated sub-questions before proceeding to answer extraction.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy
    *   **Finding:** The experiment suggests that simply decomposing the question into sub-questions without a robust mechanism for ensuring that the sub-questions are helpful and comprehensively answered can lead to failures. The overhead of managing sub-questions might outweigh the benefits.
*   **Experiment 16:**
    *   **Strategy:** Sequential chain-of-thought with specific agent roles.
    *   **Result:** 0% accuracy.
    *   **Finding:** The initial hypothesis that a sequential chain-of-thought approach with specific agent roles would provide acceptable accuracy in this dataset has been rejected, given the 0.00 accuracy score. Current LLM interaction is inadequate to produce correct answers.
*   **Experiment 17:**
    *   **Strategy:** Structured decomposition, adaptive querying, and fact verification.
    *   **Result:** 0.33 accuracy
    *   **Finding:** Structured decomposition, adaptive querying, and fact verification was not supported by the results. The system needs a far more effective and reliable mechanism for external information retrieval and integration to handle these questions.

        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

            You are developing a Python script to solve problems using LLM reasoning capabilities.
            You are in the EXPLORATION PHASE. You must generate a NEW approach that's different from previous approaches but informed by their successes and failures. With this approach, you will have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. Your goal is to see if this new approach works, and you must add verification and validation steps to deduce if this new change is helpful. You may also test RADICAL NEW APPROACHES that are substantially different from previous approaches. 
            
            You should try NEW THINGS:
            
            Break down the problem into smaller pieces
            Think CREATIVELY about how to solve your problem if other approaches aren't working
            Transform data into different formats to see if it helps

            # YOUR TASK
            You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. 
            Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics by proposing interestingly new agents.
            Observe the past discovered agents and scripts carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
            Be creative when thinking about the next interesting agent to try. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from related agent papers or academic papers from other research areas.
            Use the knowledge from the archive and inspiration from academic literature to propose the next interesting agentic system design.
            THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.

  },
  {
    "iteration": 17,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the system's **failure to accurately extrapolate and implement the grid transformation logic demonstrated in the training examples.** This manifests as either an incorrect implementation of the observed patterns or a complete misinterpretation."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 18,
    "issue": "The most critical problem is the **inaccurate transformation logic** in the `grid transformation` functionality. The logic for filling the gaps between values is incorrectly using the number '5' even when it is clear the correct values should be other numbers."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 19,
    "issue": "The single most critical problem is **the lack of null-checking or proper initialization before numerical comparisons within the core grid transformation algorithm**.  The system is attempting comparisons between numerical values and `None` when the numerical value is not properly initialized or when the input grid contains unexpected values that result in a `None` being assigned."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 20,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the inaccurate identification and application of transformation rules from training examples to the test input. The system is not robust in learning the underlying patterns and struggles with generalizing learned rules. The system is not correctly identifying how \"3\"s should be placed into the output grids based on the locations of other numbers in the input grid."
  },
  {
    "iteration": 21,
    "issue": "The primary issue is **failure to properly generalize pattern transformations from training examples.** The system appears to be memorizing specific numerical mappings and spatial configurations seen in the training examples, rather than extracting underlying rules that can be applied to new inputs. This results in incorrect numerical substitutions and flawed pattern replication."

  },
  {
    "iteration": 23,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the **incorrect output formatting**. The system does not produce a nested list (list of lists) as required for the grid output. This could be due to a Type error. It may be worth investigating if it is coercing the structure into the wrong format."

  {
    "iteration": 24,
    "issue": "The primary issue is the **incorrect JSON formatting** and **inability to correctly extrapolate and apply complex transformations** observed in the training examples.

        TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS:
        [
  "Implement a mechanism to ensure that the generated output grid has the same dimensions as the output grids in the training examples.",
  "Data Augmentation:** Generate more training examples through data augmentation techniques to provide the system with a more comprehensive understanding of the possible transformation patterns.",
  "Implement a Rule-Based System:** Implement a rule-based system that allows the system to explicitly define and apply transformation rules based on the provided training examples.",
  "Develop heuristics or learned metrics to assess the \"quality\" or \"consistency\" of the generated solution.",
  "Explore techniques such as convolutional neural networks or graph neural networks to better capture the spatial relationships and transformations within the grids.",
  "If the verification step identifies inconsistencies, explore techniques such as iterative refinement or re-generation of the solution.",
  "Self-Verification:** The system should test its generated output against the inputs of the training examples to verify that its code makes sense and is working correctly.",
  "Implement a more explicit representation of the identified pattern, such as a symbolic description of the transformation rules. This representation can then be used to guide the transformation of the test input.",
  "Explicitly track the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the input and output grids in the training examples.",
  "Introduce More Sophisticated Pattern Recognition Techniques:** Implement more sophisticated pattern recognition techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs), to better capture the complex relationships between grid elements."

    Example usage:
    
    Problem:
    Design a data structure that can efficiently perform the following operations:
    1. Insert a value
    2. Delete a value
    3. Get a random value with equal probability for all stored values
    All operations should have average time complexity of O(1).
    
    Proposed Solution:
    I'll use a combination of a hashmap and an array. The hashmap will store the value as the key and its index in the array as the value. The array will store all the inserted values.
    
    For insert: Add the value to the end of the array and update the hashmap with the value and its index. O(1) time.
    
    For delete: Look up the index of the value in the hashmap, swap the value with the last element in the array, update the hashmap for the swapped element, remove the last element from the array, and remove the value from the hashmap. O(1) time.
    
    For get random: Generate a random index within the array's bounds and return the value at that index. O(1) time.
    
    Verification:
    Let me check each requirement:
    1. Insert operation: The solution adds the value to the end of the array and updates the hashmap with O(1) time complexity ✓
    2. Delete operation: The solution uses the hashmap to find the index, then swaps with the last element and updates accordingly with O(1) time complexity ✓
    3. Get random operation: The solution generates a random index within the array bounds with O(1) time complexity ✓
    4. All operations have O(1) average time complexity ✓
    
    Result: VALID - The solution correctly addresses all requirements with the specified time complexity.

```MULTI-EXAMPLE PROMPTING GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Use MULTIPLE examples (2-5) in EVERY LLM prompt, not just one
        2. Vary the number of examples based on task complexity - more complex tasks need more examples
        3. Select diverse examples that showcase different patterns and edge cases
        4. Structure your few-shot examples to demonstrate clear step-by-step reasoning
        5. Consider using both "easy" and "challenging" examples to help the LLM learn from contrasts
        6. The collection of examples should collectively cover all key aspects of the problem
        7. When available, use examples from previous iterations that revealed specific strengths or weaknesses.
        8. USE REAL EXAMPLES FROM THE DATASET WHERE POSSIBLE!!

        Example of poor single-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        Example of effective multi-example prompting:
        ```python
        def extract_entities(text):
            prompt = f'''
            Extract entities from this text.

            Example 1:
            Text: John will meet Mary at 3pm on Tuesday.
            Entities: {{"people": ["John", "Mary"], "time": "3pm", "day": "Tuesday"}}

            Example 2:
            Text: The team needs to submit the report by Friday at noon.
            Entities: {{"people": ["the team"], "time": "noon", "day": "Friday", "object": "report"}}

            Example 3:
            Text: Alex cannot attend the conference from Jan 3-5 due to prior commitments.
            Entities: {{"people": ["Alex"], "event": "conference", "date_range": ["Jan 3-5"], "reason": "prior commitments"}}

            Text: {text}
            Entities:
            '''
            return call_llm(prompt)
        ```

        === DIRECT LLM REASONING APPROACH ===

        CRITICAL: Previous scripts have shown that complex code generation with JSON parsing and multi-step pipelines often 
        leads to errors and low performance. Instead, focus on leveraging the LLM's natural reasoning abilities:

        1. SIMPLIFY YOUR APPROACH:
           - Minimize the number of processing steps - simpler is better
           - Directly use LLM for pattern recognition rather than writing complex code
           - Avoid trying to parse or manipulate JSON manually - pass it as text to the LLM

        2. DIRECT TRANSFORMATION:
           - Instead of trying to extract features and then apply them, use the LLM to do the transformation directly
           - Use examples to teach the LLM the pattern, then have it apply that pattern to new inputs
           - Avoid attempting to write complex algorithmic solutions when pattern recognition will work better

        3. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING:
           - Include multiple approaches in case one fails (direct approach + fallback approach)
           - Use simple validation to check if outputs are in the expected format
           - Include a last-resort approach that will always return something valid

        4. AVOID COMMON PITFALLS:
           - Do NOT attempt to use json.loads() or complex JSON parsing - it often fails
           - Do NOT create overly complex Python pipelines that require perfect indentation
           - Do NOT create functions that generate or execute dynamic code
           - Do NOT create unnecessarily complex data transformations

        5. SUCCESSFUL EXAMPLES:
           - The most successful approaches have used direct pattern matching with multiple examples
           - Scripts with simple validation and fallback approaches perform better
           - Scripts with fewer processing steps have higher success rates
        
        IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Maintain a "example bank" of successful and failed examples to select from
        2. Implement n-shot prompting with n=3 as default, but adapt based on performance
        3. For complex tasks, use up to 5 examples; for simpler tasks, 2-3 may be sufficient
        4. Include examples with a range of complexity levels, rather than all similar examples



        VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION GUIDANCE:
        1. CRITICAL: Consider implementing validation loops for EACH key processing step, not just final outputs
        2. Design your system to detect, diagnose, and recover from specific errors. This will help future learnings
        3. For every LLM extraction or generation, add a verification step that checks:
           - Whether the output is well-formed and complete
           - Whether the output is logically consistent with the input
           - Whether all constraints are satisfied
        4. Add feedback loops that retry failures with specific feedback
        5. Include diagnostic outputs that reveal exactly where failures occur. Add print statements and intermediate outputs such that you can see them later to determine why things are going wrong.
        6. Include capability to trace through execution steps to identify failure points

        Example of pipeline without verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question):
            entities = extract_entities(question)
            constraints = identify_constraints(question)
            solution = generate_solution(entities, constraints)
            return solution
        ```

        Example of robust pipeline with verification:
        ```python
        def process_question(question, max_attempts=3):
            # Step 1: Extract entities with verification
            entities_result = extract_entities_with_verification(question)
            if not entities_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Entity extraction failed: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in entity extraction: {entities_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 2: Identify constraints with verification
            constraints_result = identify_constraints_with_verification(question, entities_result["entities"])
            if not constraints_result.get("is_valid"):
                print(f"Constraint identification failed: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}")
                return f"Error in constraint identification: {constraints_result.get('validation_feedback')}"

            # Step 3: Generate solution with verification
            solution_result = generate_solution_with_verification(
                question, 
                entities_result["entities"],

        VALIDATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
        1. Create detailed verification functions for each major processing step
        2. Implement max_attempts limits on all retry loops (typically 3-5 attempts)
        3. Pass specific feedback from verification to subsequent retry attempts
        4. Log all verification failures to help identify systemic issues
        5. Design fallback behaviors when verification repeatedly fails

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 25 (Exploitation, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: The script uses a chain-of-thought approach with verification to solve grid transformation problems, decomposing the task into analyzing visual features and applying a transformation. The `analyze_visual_features` function uses an LLM to describe the transformation, validates the description, and refines it based on feedback, acting as an expert visual analyzer. The `apply_transformation` function then uses the LLM to apply the transformation, acting as an expert grid transformer. The overall workflow involves `solve_grid_transformation` calling `analyze_visual_features` to get a transformation description, then calling `apply_transformation` to generate the transformed grid, with both functions using `call_llm` to interact with the Gemini model.

```python

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 24 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.00) ===
Approach: This script solves grid transformation problems by using an LLM to identify patterns and complete grids. It decomposes the problem into identifying key locations and context numbers within the grid using the `identify_locations_and_context` function, and then performing grid completion using the `perform_grid_completion` function. The LLM acts as an expert in pattern recognition and grid completion, and is prompted to perform these tasks. Other functions include `solve_grid_transformation` which orchestrates the solution, and `call_llm` which is a utility function that calls the Gemini API. The workflow starts with `solve_grid_transformation` calling `identify_locations_and_context` to find the template and `perform_grid_completion` to solve the grid, and each of these functions uses the `call_llm` function to interact with the LLM.

The system will first identify locations and the context number, then have an LLM perform the extrapolation. This will have an LLM use a template to help identify patterns and perform a simple propagation to identify missing numbers.

=== SCRIPT FROM ITERATION 21 (Exploration, ACCURACY: 0.33) ===
Approach: The script uses an LLM to solve grid transformation problems by decomposing the problem into identifying regions and rules, and then applying transformations based on those rules. Two agent roles are implicitly used: one for identifying regions and rules, and another for applying transformations. The `solve_grid_transformation` function orchestrates the process, calling `identify_regions_and_rules` to get the regions and rules, and then `apply_transformation` to transform the grid. `call_llm` is used to communicate with the Gemini LLM, taking a prompt and system instruction, and returning the LLM's response.

```python

import math

# EXPLORATION: Region-Based Transformation with Rule Selection via LLM and Rule Application with Explicit Mapping
# HYPOTHESIS: The LLM can be used to identify regions and rules on those regions, then it can more reliably transform them with this information.
# We're attempting to improve performance in cases with inconsistent operations that past systems struggled with.
# We will try dividing the grid into regions and applying the mapping transformation on each region by prompting LLM.

            LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
            
        ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS FROM PREVIOUS ITERATIONS:
        Okay, I've synthesized the existing knowledge with the new learnings from Iteration 25, ensuring all existing information is preserved, the document length is reduced and the focus remains on concrete, task-specific insights for the Grid Transformation Task dataset.

**1. DATASET PATTERNS & CHARACTERISTICS**

*   **Question Format:** Tasks are presented as "Grid Transformation Tasks" with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" (input/output grid pairs) and a "TEST INPUT" grid. The objective is to generate the "OUTPUT GRID" for the test input, following patterns from the training examples.
*   **Consistent Structure:** Questions follow a consistent structure: a "Grid Transformation Task" header, "TRAINING EXAMPLES" with Input/Output grid pairs, a "TEST INPUT" grid, and an instruction to transform the test input.
*   **Grid Representation:** Grids are represented as nested lists of integers (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`). Grid dimensions (rows and columns) vary. Grids are typically small matrices of integers, often with a background value (e.g., 0) and a few other distinct values that participate in the transformation rules. Input and Output grid have consistent dimensions within a question, but may vary between training and test grids. Grids are typically 10x10 or 17x17.
*   **Mixed Element Types:** Grids often contain a mix of elements, including zeros and other numerical values. There appear to be 'border' values, and 'inner' values that are subject to transformation.
*   **Training Examples followed by Test Input:** Each problem is structured with "TRAINING EXAMPLES" showing input-output pairs, followed by a "TEST INPUT" for which the transformed grid must be generated.
*   **Abstracted Transformations:** The transformations are not explicitly described but must be inferred from the input-output pairs in the training examples. This requires the model to identify both content-based and spatial patterns. A common structure is to maintain most of the grid the same, while transforming certain numbers into other numbers based on their spatial relationships.
*   **Transformation Logic:** The core challenge is identifying the transformation logic. This logic can involve:
    *   Expansion, substitution, mirroring, replication of rows/columns, shifting values, replacing values based on surrounding cells, and combinations of these. Transformations are consistent within each training example pair, but not across training example pairs.
    *   Spatial relationships between numbers (e.g., a cell's value depends on its neighbors). The rules are often *localized* to the vicinity of a cell, or, conversely, depend on characteristics of a subgrid. Spatial reasoning is often required. New elements can be placed at new locations based on the spatial relationships of other numbers in the grid. The system struggles with patterns that are based on *where* something is relative to something else (e.g., "change all 1s that are next to a 2 to a 3"). The underlying task demands extrapolating a relatively abstract visual pattern from a very small number of examples.
    *   Numerical transformations (e.g., adding a constant to each cell). It appears the system tends to memorize specific number-to-number transformations seen in training, rather than extracting the underlying logic. For example, in one case (Iteration 22), the model incorrectly maps a '1' to a '5' instead of the other way around.
    *   Combinations of spatial and numerical transformations. The transformations can be complex and context-dependent, applying differently based on the location or the neighboring elements of an element.
    *   Transformations can involve replacing elements with new values based on their original value and location, and introducing new non-zero values to previously zeroed cells.
    *   Transformations often involve identifying specific numbers or patterns within the grid and then applying a change based on their location or relationship to other elements.
    *   A key characteristic is the presence of patterns relating the input and output grids, which involve moving, shifting, or transforming numbers within the grid.
    *   Grid reduction and value extraction are also possible transformations. Transformations can even collapse a large grid to a single element.
    *   The model struggles to apply multiple transformation rules within a single grid.
    *   Transformations often involve replicating and/or propagating numbers from certain locations to fill empty spaces. The model frequently fails to correctly identify *which* numbers from the input grid need to be propagated and replicated in the output grid.
    *   Some questions may include "filler" numbers; some grids can contain numbers that do not get transferred and instead get overwritten.
    *   Many elements in the input grid map to zero in the output grid, suggesting that the relevant transformation is often localized or involves significant data reduction.
*   **Implicit Rules:** Transformation logic is *never* explicitly stated. The LLM must infer the rules from limited training examples.
*   **Abstract Rules:** The underlying transformation rules are abstract and not immediately obvious.
*   **Few-Shot Learning Format:** Questions are presented in a few-shot format.
*   **Varying Grid Sizes:** Transformations might be size-dependent. *New:* The output grid can sometimes be a different size/shape compared to the input grid.
*   **Multiple Possible Rules:** Different transformations might yield similar results on the training data but diverge on the test data.
*   **Value Dependencies:** A cell's new value may depend on multiple other cells.
*   **Asymmetric Transformations:** The transformation might not be symmetrical across the grid.
*   **Value Encoding:** Specific values within the grids (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9) have semantic meaning related to the transformation.
*   **Element Distribution:** The approach fails when faced with new input grids that have different element distributions compared to the training examples.
*   **Limited Training Examples:** The number of training examples provided is often limited (typically 1-3), making robust pattern recognition and generalization challenging.
*   **Zero Prevalence:** Many grids contain a significant number of zeros, particularly in the training examples. Non-zero values often represent distinct visual elements or patterns, and the transformations involve replicating, shifting, or altering these elements.
*   **Limited Integer Values:** Grids often contain a limited set of integer values (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8). The transformations involve changing these values based on their positions within the grid and their relationships to other values.
*   **Inconsistent Input-Output Size:** The LLM fails to produce the correct output format when the output grid is a different size than the input grid, and also when the size is not consistent between the training and test examples.
*   **Varied Transformation Rules:** The underlying transformation rules are diverse, ranging from neighbor-based replacement to tiling/replication patterns. This variability makes generalization challenging.

**2. EFFECTIVE TASK-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES**

*   **None consistently effective:** Given the consistently low accuracy, no single strategy has emerged as reliably effective for this dataset (Iteration 22: Accuracy 0.33, Iteration 23: Accuracy 0.00, Iteration 24: Accuracy 0.00, Iteration 25: Accuracy 0.00).
*   **LLM-based Visual Feature Analysis (Potentially Useful):** Using an LLM to analyze the visual features and infer transformation rules is a promising approach, but generalization remains a major challenge. The attempt to decompose the problem into visual feature analysis and transformation application is a potentially sound strategy, *if* the model can accurately perform the feature analysis.
*   **Two-Step LLM Approach (Potentially Useful):** The two-step LLM approach (analyze then apply) shows some promise, but is still insufficient for reliable generalization.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Specialized Agents (Inconsistent):** The chain-of-thought approach, with specialized expert agents for visual feature analysis and transformation application, shows promise but suffers from inconsistent performance due to the LLM's issues with generalization.
*   **Decomposition (Helpful):** Breaking down the problem into analyzing visual features and applying the transformation simplifies the task.
*   **Chain-of-Thought with Multi-Example Prompts (Helpful):** Chain-of-thought prompting with multi-example prompts has been helpful in guiding the LLM to recognize patterns, but improvements are needed.
*   **Analogical Reasoning (Potentially Useful):** The analogical reasoning approach demonstrates potential in pattern recognition, but has not achieved high accuracy.
*   **Proper API Configuration (Critical):** API configuration is paramount for any LLM-based strategy to function. The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable must be correctly set, and the chosen LLM model (e.g., 'gemini-pro') must be accessible.
*   **LLM-guided recursive subdivision (Potentially Useful):** If transformations are locally consistent, then LLM-guided recursive subdivision *might* have potential.
*   **Coordinate-based transformation rules generated from an LLM (Potentially Useful):** At a basic level the LLM is able to correctly identify locations of numbers.
*   **Code Generation approach:** The LLM is successful at generating Python code to manipulate the grid data structures.
*   **Neighbor detection:** The model attempts to look at neighbors and perform transformations based on neighbor values.

**3. COMMON FAILURE MODES ON THIS DATASET**

*   **Incorrect Rule Abstraction:** The primary failure mode is the inability to accurately infer the transformation rule from the limited examples. For example, in the first error example of Iteration 25, the model tried a simple neighbor-based replacement rule based on training data, but the code generated did not reflect that.
*   **Incorrect Output Format:** The system consistently fails to produce a nested list (list of lists) as required, instead returning an error message or other non-grid output. This is a fundamental flaw in the `apply_transformation` function or in data coercion preventing the creation of the correct data structure. *Example: Iteration 23.*
*   **Incorrect JSON Formatting:** The LLM frequently produces output that is not valid JSON. Specifically, it includes backticks or quotation marks around the entire JSON array, adds extra levels of nesting, or includes leading/trailing whitespace which violates JSON syntax. This is a consistent failure mode across many examples.
*   **Inability to Extrapolate Complex Transformations:** The LLM struggles to generalize from the training examples to the test input, especially when the transformation involves complex spatial reasoning or understanding of relationships between different parts of the grid. Even in cases where the JSON is correctly formatted, the transformed grid is often incorrect. This means that value propagation is not happening successfully.
*   **Incorrect Content Transformation:** The model struggles to accurately identify and apply the correct number transformations. For example, in one case (Iteration 22), it incorrectly maps a '1' to a '5' instead of the other way around.
*   **Pattern Generalization Failure:** The core failure is the inability to generalize transformation rules from training examples to the test input. Even slight variations between the training set and the test input can cause failure. The LLM demonstrates *poor generalization* failing to extrapolate transformation rules. In the first error example of Iteration 21, the LLM fails to correctly transfer the pattern of moving numbers from one area of the grid to another, and transforming them as they move.
*   **Numerical Mapping Errors:** The system fails to consistently map numbers correctly. It appears to memorize specific number-to-number transformations seen in training, but doesn't extract the underlying logic. In Iteration 21, the first failure example, the golden answer has 3s and 4s while the actual answer contains 7s and 3s, suggesting direct numerical substitutions (e.g., "8 becomes 7"), but not how or where to apply them in the grid.
*   **Spatial Configuration Misinterpretation:** The system struggles to discern the spatial aspects of the transformations. It may identify regions, but fails to understand how elements within those regions should be rearranged or replicated to produce the correct output. In the second error example of Iteration 21, the LLM fails to correctly copy a pattern of 5's from one location to another, demonstrating a failure to understand the *spatial* aspect of the transformation.
*   **Output Grid Dimension Errors:** The model often generates output grids with incorrect dimensions, either in terms of row or column count (Iteration 22). It cannot match the grid size with the expected output, even when dimensions are explicitly shown in training examples.
*   **Null Value Handling:** The script encounters `None` values during numerical comparisons. This likely happens when the LLM returns unexpected output or when the input grid has unexpected values that the code doesn't handle, leading to the assignment of `None` to a variable that is then used in a numerical comparison.
*   **Unexpected Input Values**: There may be inconsistencies in the input data format, such as missing values or incorrect data types, that are not being properly validated or handled before processing.
*   **LLM Access Failure:** The system's inability to access the designated LLM (e.g., 'gemini-pro'), leading to a complete failure to generate any output. This can be due to incorrect API key configuration, unavailability of the model, or network connectivity issues. *Example: Iteration 12.*
*   **API Key Configuration Issues:** Incorrectly setting or failing to retrieve the API key from the environment (e.g., the environment variable `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) prevents the system from accessing the LLM. *Example: Iteration 12.*
*   **Empty Output Grid:** Frequently returns an empty list `[[]]`, indicating a breakdown in grid manipulation or output formatting.
*   **Inability to Generate Valid Output:** The system fails to capture the underlying patterns in the training examples and apply them to the test input.
*   **Complex Reasoning:** The system struggles with questions that require complex reasoning about spatial relationships or value dependencies within the grid.
*   **Over-Reliance on Memorization:** The LLM seems to memorize training examples rather than generalizing the transformation logic.
*   **Inability to Abstract Complex Rules:** The dataset requires the abstraction of non-linear relationships and contextual dependencies within the grid.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Generalization:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation patterns from the training examples.
*   **Pattern Misinterpretation:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the underlying transformation logic from the training examples.
*   **Inability to abstract general rules:** The model fails to generalize from the limited examples to novel test inputs.
*   **Incorrect Application:** Even when the LLM correctly identifies the transformation, it struggles to apply it to the test input.
*   **Lack of Spatial Precision:** LLMs sometimes struggle with precise spatial relationships within the grid. The system struggles to place transformed elements in the correct positions within the output grid, suggesting a weakness in understanding and applying the spatial logic of the transformation.
*   **Dimensionality Mismatch:** The LLM generates output grids with incorrect dimensions compared to the expected output grid.
*   **Shape and Dimensionality Errors:** The generated output grids often have incorrect shapes or dimensions compared to the expected output.
*   **Output Format Mismatch:** The generated output grid does not match the size or shape expected by the golden answer, even if the values have some correctness.
*   **Incorrect Value Mapping:** Even when the dimensions are correct, the LLM fails to map values correctly. The numerical relationships between corresponding cells in the input and output grids are not accurately learned and applied.
*   **Incorrect Element Replacement:** The system might be identifying the correct structure, but using the wrong numbers.
*   **Value Errors:** The system generates grids containing numbers not present in the target grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** The LLM outputs the response as a string containing Python code that *would* define the output grid, rather than directly outputting the grid.
*   **Ambiguity:** The transformations are implicit and can be interpreted in multiple ways from just a few examples.
*   **Complexity:** The underlying transformations might be complex involving combinations of replication, shifting, value changes, and so on.
*   **Inability to Extract Accurate Transformation Rules:** The system consistently fails to extract accurate and generalizable transformation rules from the training examples.
*   **Fragility of Pattern Recognition:** The system's pattern recognition approach is fragile and easily disrupted by small variations in the input grids.
*   **Lack of Rule Validation:** The system's rule validation process is not robust enough to catch inaccurate or incomplete rules.
*   **Localized Contextual Analysis Insufficient:** The LLM struggles to generalize even seemingly simple local rules across the entire grid.
*   **Oversimplification of Transformations:** The LLM tends to oversimplify the transformation rules, leading to incorrect outputs.
*   **Complex Rule Interpretation:** The system struggles when the transformation involves multiple intertwined rules.
*   **Incomplete Generalization:** The model fails to accurately generalize rules based on limited examples.
*   **In-place vs. New Object Confusion:** The model is getting confused with modifying the input grid vs. creating a new output grid.
*   **Incorrect Mirroring Logic:** In cases where the transformation involves mirroring, the implemented logic is sometimes flawed, leading to incorrect placements of mirrored elements or unintended modifications.
*   **Positional Transformation Neglect:** The system is unable to accurately capture how the grid modifies elements and their positions to produce the result.
*   **Difficulty with complex value dependencies:** The model struggles when the transformation relies on complex combinations or relationships between different values in the grid.
*   **Misinterpretation of spatial relationships:** The model incorrectly interprets how objects and values in the grid are spatially related and how these relationships change during the transformation.
*   **Misinterpretation of Visual Features:** The `analyze_visual_features` step is prone to misinterpreting the key visual features of the grid.
*   **Inconsistent Transformation Application:** The primary failure mode is the inconsistent application of identified transformation rules to the test input.
*   **Ambiguous Transformations:** Some training examples might have multiple possible interpretations, leading the LLM to learn an incorrect or incomplete transformation.
*   **Error in output format**: The model can reason correctly about the grid transformation, but then output a grid of the incorrect size, or even the correct size but as text rather than code.
*   **Dimensionality and Element Distribution:** The approach fails when faced with new input grids that have different dimensions or element distributions compared to the training examples.
*   **Error in Transformation:** The LLM sometimes produces an error rather than a valid transformation.
*   **Overfitting to Superficial Patterns:** The system tends to overfit to simple patterns in the training examples (Iteration 13).
*   **Inability to Generalize Complex Rules:** The system struggles with complex transformation rules that involve relationships between different elements or regions of the grid (Iteration 13). The transformation logic often requires spatial reasoning which the LLM fails to capture (Iteration 13).
*   **Output validation inadequate:** Relying on an LLM for output validation may be flawed.
*   **Incorrect Pattern Identification:** The LLM fails to correctly identify the transformation pattern from the limited training examples.
*   **Inability to Handle Number Transformations:** The LLM struggles with generalizing the transformation of numbers within the grid.
*   **Code Generation Errors:** Even when the LLM identifies a possible pattern, the generated code often contains logical errors or fails to translate the pattern into correct grid manipulation.
*   **Ignoring Existing Grid Values:** The model struggles with transformations that require *both* copying values *and* introducing a fill value.
*   **Context-Switching Errors:** The model struggles to perform different transformations in the same grid at once.
*   **No Fallback Mechanisms:** The system doesn't seem to have robust error handling or fallback mechanisms when the LLM-based transformation fails. The absence of these recovery measures leads to complete failure.
*   **Lack of Output Constraints:** The LLM is not constrained to produce valid numerical grids.
*   **Incorrect coordinate application:** Even when the LLM identifies a pattern, the coordinate transformation is sometimes misapplied, leading to numbers appearing in the wrong locations in the output grid.
*   **Combined Analytical and Application Complexity:** The complexity of relying on the LLM to both analyze visual features AND apply the transformation, requires a perfect output format which is difficult to guarantee. *Example: Iteration 23.*
*   **Misinterpretation of Patterns:** In the second error example of Iteration 25, the model incorrectly identified a pattern of alternating values based on the sum of row and column indices. The model failed to correctly identify the intended rule.
*   **Incorrect Transformation Implementation:** The model implements incorrect code that does not accurately perform the required transformation. In the third error example of Iteration 25, the model doubles rows and columns but does not perform the correct transformation based on neighbor calculations.
*   **Limitation of Simple CoT:** The CoT with verification approach fails because the LLM was unable to correctly interpret the problem transformation. The approach fails because the LLM is not able to extract the rules of transformations.

**4. EXPERIMENT LOG & FINDINGS**

*   **Iteration 0:** Direct pattern matching is ineffective (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 1:** Explicit rule extraction and validation are insufficient (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 2:** Localized contextual analysis is insufficient (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 3:** Breaking down the grid transformation into individual element transformations is insufficient (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 4:** Extracting and applying rules with validation does not lead to performance (Accuracy 0.00)
*   **Iteration 5:** Row and column analysis does not simplify pattern recognition (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 6:** Hierarchical decomposition does not address the underlying inability to generalize (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 7:** Describing transformations in terms of visual features partially improves generalization (Accuracy 0.33).
*   **Iteration 8:** Analogical reasoning via multiple LLM calls was not validated (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 9:** Relying solely on the LLM's ability to directly transform the grid based on multi-example prompts is insufficient (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 10:** Multi-example prompting improves performance compared to single-example prompting in the two-step LLM approach, but is still insufficient for reliable generalization (Accuracy 0.33).
*   **Iteration 11:** Exploitation of the current approach did not yield significant improvement (Accuracy 0.33).
*   **Iteration 12:** LLM access failure due to API configuration issues (Accuracy 0.00). Proper API configuration is paramount.
*   **Iteration 13:** Adding more detailed examples and implementing a validation loop does not improve visual feature analysis and transformation application (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 14:** The LLM cannot directly generate the output grid by learning a transformation function represented implicitly in the examples (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 15:** Multi-example prompting and implementing explicit output checks did not improve generalization (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 16:** Better validation loops do not lead to higher generalization (Accuracy 0.00).
*   **Iteration 17:** The LLM cannot generate and follow a natural language transformation script effectively (Accuracy: 0.33). Script following is bottlenecked by the LLM's ability to create correct and representative scripts.
*   **Iteration 18:** A multi-agent iterative refinement strategy cannot improve the LLM's ability to generalize grid transformation patterns (Accuracy: 0.00)
*   **Iteration 19:** LLM-Orchestrated Recursive Subdivision and Transformation fails (Accuracy: 0.00). The script encountered `None` values during numerical comparisons.
*   **Iteration 20:** Explicitly prompting coordinate-based rules with contextual awareness only partially supports the hypothesis (Accuracy: 0.33). The LLM can identify locations of numbers, but either struggles to identify correct transformations or struggles to apply them correctly.
*   **Iteration 21:** Region-based transformation with rule selection via LLM is not effective (Accuracy 0.33). Identifying and applying the rules accurately requires a more robust system. The model struggles to transfer knowledge about spatial transformations and numerical manipulations across different grid configurations.
*   **Iteration 22:** Knowledge Graph approach does not improve generalization or spatial reasoning (Accuracy: 0.33). Providing multiple examples doesn't guarantee pattern recognition. The LLM isn't able to extract the underlying rules from the examples effectively.
*   **Iteration 23:** The experimental approach, relying on an LLM to analyze visual features and generate the output grid, is unsuccessful. Consistently fails to produce the required nested list structure, leading to 0.00 accuracy. Rejects the hypothesis that an LLM can reliably solve grid transformation problems in a single step with the current implementation.

    *SCRIPT ERROR ENCOUNTERED* during script repair attempts.
*   **Iteration 24:** Exploration of contextual grid completion with value propagation using a pattern-based template and LLM verification failed (Accuracy: 0.00). The LLM struggles with JSON formatting, extrapolation of complex transformations, and handling variable output sizes. The hypothesis that a structured template identifying key locations and context numbers, combined with LLM extrapolation, would improve generalization was rejected. The LLM's ability to correctly identify patterns within a grid and perform the required transformations is very low.
*   **Iteration 25:** The initial hypothesis that adding more examples and a more robust validation loop with formatting enforcement would improve generalization was rejected. The accuracy of 0.00 indicates that the core issue lies in rule extraction, not just output formatting.

**5. NEXT RESEARCH DIRECTIONS**

This might involve using image processing techniques to extract visual features from the grids or using more sophisticated prompting strategies to guide the LLM's pattern recognition process.

*   **Improved Output Validation:** Implement a more robust validation function that can evaluate the *logic* of the transformation in the output grid, rather than just its format.
*   **Introduce Explicit Rule Extraction:** Focus on methods that first extract explicit transformation rules from the training examples and then apply those rules to the test input.
*   **Decompose the Transformation Process:** Decompose the transformation process into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, identifying specific regions or elements to transform, determining the transformation operation, and applying the operation.

        CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE:
        SYSTEM ANALYSIS & GUIDANCE


        

            EXPLORATION GUIDANCE:
            1. Review the historical approaches, error patterns, and accumulated learnings carefully
            2. Review the FULL CODE of previous scripts to understand what has already been tried
            3. Design a new approach that is DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT from previous attempts. This approach should have a specific NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable you are trying to test. 
            4. CRITICAL: Include EMBEDDED EXAMPLES directly within your LLM prompts
            5. For each key function, show a complete worked example, or include multiple examples, including:
               - Input example that resembles the dataset
               - Step-by-step reasoning through the example
               - Properly formatted output
            6. Apply the insights from the ACCUMULATED LEARNINGS section to avoid repeating past mistakes
            7. Pay SPECIAL ATTENTION to the weaknesses and improvement suggestions from the capability assessment
            8. Consider implementing one or more of these LLM usage patterns:
               - Repeated validation with feedback loops
               - Multi-perspective analysis with synthesis
               - Dynamic input-dependent routing with an orchestrator
               - Hybrid approaches combining LLM with deterministic functions
               - Best-of-n solution generation and selection
               - ReAct pattern for interactive reasoning and action
               - If it is unknown how successful a processing state or part of the pipeline is, include verification steps to different parts of the pipeline in order to help deduce which parts are successful and where the system is breaking
               - Answer checkers to validate the final answer against the problem statement. If the answer is incorrect, the checker can send the answer back to an earlier part of the system for for refinement with feedback

            Here's how to call the Gemini API. Use this example without modification and don't invent configuration options:
            def call_llm(prompt, system_instruction=None):
    """Call the Gemini LLM with a prompt and return the response. DO NOT deviate from this example template or invent configuration options. This is how you call the LLM."""
    try:
        from google import genai
        from google.genai import types

        # Initialize the Gemini client
        client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ.get("GEMINI_API_KEY"))

        # Call the API with system instruction if provided
        if system_instruction:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash", 
                config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
                    system_instruction=system_instruction
                ),
                contents=prompt
            )
        else:
            response = client.models.generate_content(
                model="gemini-2.0-flash",
                contents=prompt
            )

        return response.text
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling Gemini API: {str(e)}")
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

            Since this is an EXPLORATION phase:
            - Try a fundamentally different approach to reasoning about the problem. Test a NEW HYPOTHESIS or variable, and add verification steps to deduce if this new change is helpful.
            - THIS IS KEY: Break down the problem into new, distinct reasoning steps based on past performance before you start coding
            - For EACH key LLM prompt, include a relevant example with:
              * Sample input similar to the dataset
              * Expected reasoning steps
              * Desired output format
            - Apply a verifier call to different parts of the pipeline in order to understand what parts of the pipeline of calls is successful and where the system is breaking
            - Pay special attention to addressing the primary issues from previous iterations
            - Ensure your new approach addresses the weaknesses identified in the capability assessment

            CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
            1. The script MUST properly handle all string literals - be extremely careful with quotes and triple quotes
            2. The script MUST NOT exceed 150 lines of code to prevent truncation
            3. Include detailed comments explaining your reasoning approach
            4. EVERY SINGLE LLM PROMPT must include at least one embedded example showing:
               - Sample input with reasoning
               - Desired output format
            5. Make proper use of error handling
            6. Implement robust capabilities to address the specific weaknesses identified in the capability assessment
            7. Do NOT use json.loads() in the LLM calls to process input data. JSON formatting is good to use to structure information as inputs and outputs, but attempting to have functions process JSON data explicitly with strict built-in functionality is error prone due to formatting issues and additional text that appears as documentation, reasoning, or comments. When passing data into another LLM call, you can read it as plain text rather than trying to load it in strict json format, is the better approach.

            Return a COMPLETE, RUNNABLE Python script that:
            1. Has a main function that takes a question string as input and returns the answer string
            2. Makes multiple LLM calls for different reasoning steps
            3. Has proper error handling for API calls
            4. Includes embedded examples in EVERY LLM prompt
            5. Is COMPLETE - no missing code, no "..." placeholders
            6. Closes all string literals properly

            This should be FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from all previous approaches. Do not reuse the same overall structure.

            BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL TO PROPERLY CLOSE ALL STRING QUOTES AND TRIPLE QUOTES!

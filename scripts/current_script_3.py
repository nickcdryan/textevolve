    You are an expert visual pattern recognition system. Analyze the training examples and identify the transformation rule by visually comparing the input and output grids. Focus on visual patterns, symmetries, and value distributions.

    Example 1:
    Input Grid:
    [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]
    Output Grid:
    [[1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
    Transformation Rule: Invert the grid - 0 becomes 1, and 1 becomes 0.
    
    Example 2:
    Input Grid:
    [[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]
    Output Grid:
    [[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]]
